"Hey all, I know I said I wouldn't post since I was going to be on 7 days for work this week, but my manager came in halfway through my shift today, told me he was taking over, and to enjoy the rest of my day, so, here I am for another quick tale.

Today's story is about my finger, and how it is the most expensive purchase my hotel had in quite a while. I was opening some boxes at work with a pair of scissors, the way a lot of people do, but while I was opening one, my hand got caught on the box, and caused the scissors to close on my finger, causing a pretty deep cut. I walk in the back where my unhelpful supervisor and coworker were talking per usual, and put a band aid on my finger, which was soaked in a single second.

Introducing our cast since it will make this story easier to follow: Me: guy with bleeding finger, S: Supervisor, C: Coworker, B: Bartender, M: Mom

Me: Hey, I am pretty sure I have to go to the hospital, I cut my finger open pretty badly.

C: Oh let me see it, I'm sure it's not that bad.

She then clamps a towel on my finger and begins applying pressure. My supervisor is freaking out and runs out of the back office, only to return with the bartender, some rags, and ice. My coworker then removes what she was using to compress the wound, mind you, I was beginning to lose the feeling in the tip of it. It immediately started bleeding again, to which the bartender clamped it shut.

B: He needs to go to the hospital, nothing we have can fix this.

C: Fine, I'll get started on the incident report (she says this begrudgingly as she was going to get to leave early, and now that isn't happening.)

S: I'll call M (she worked there too so everyone had her number on standby) to take him since I don't think you want to drive while clutching your finger.

Me: No not really, I'd rather bleed without worrying about too much else.

She calls my mom, but she basically worded it that my finger was cut off completely, which made my mom make a 30 minute drive 10 minutes to get to the hotel. She gets there and brings me to the emergency room, where I was dropped off while she found parking. I have lost all the feeling in my fingertip at this point, and it was starting to go down the finger too. After talking with the doctor and some stitches later, I found out I had managed to cut all the way to the bone. I then asked him if I'd regain the feeling in my fingertip, which he replied with a simple maybe. To this day I still have no felling, and a pretty nasty scar to go with it. The icing on the cake happened a few weeks later.

I was at the desk, and my GM came up to me, and asked to see the finger that I had cut open. I show it to him, and he writes a dollar amount on it. Apparently, my finger cost the hotel more money than an ac unit we had to fix, and he wanted me to be painfully aware of that fact. I made it up to him though by sending him a bag of gummy dicks, and a note that said ""eat a bag of dicks"".My expensive finger.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My first call of the evening is a driver for a company we deal with. He's on and on trying to ask me if we still have an account, and that he's got his kids with him. I was like yeah, we do, and their rate includes double rooms so no problem with the kids. Then he's like ""You all still have the pool?"" I respond that we do, however it is closed due to the pandemic. I explain that he will find all of our facilities are pretty much shut down, no pool, no gym, no hot breakfast. (as is the same with all the other hotels in town if not state.) He then asks if the Italian restaurant across the bridge is open. I'm super confused because there's not 1 restaurant across the bridge. He completely butchered the name of the place he meant so I was was drawing a blank. Dude is getting pissed at this point. I finally figure out the place he's talking about, which is about 3 miles in the opposite direction of the bridge. I was like ""Well yeah, they're open for curbside pickup or delivery."" Apparently this was too much for him and finally yelled ""Well what am I supposed to do with my kids?!?""  It took a bit for me to not snap back at him. 

Then,, we have an ""essential guest"" in house. Her company emailed us a travel letter. She could not cover her room on a credit card so some way the hell older dude with her used his. They're both local(ish) her ID says she lives about a hundred miles away, but she says she lives in town. Dude lives about 2 towns over. (I didn't check them in.)

Hours later a group of people show up at my door, I buzz them in and they ask if they can charge their phones. That's an immediate no, I explain that we are on lockdown and that no.. our facilities are only open to guests. One of them gets all ""Well my friend is staying here!"", and as we all know, the randos that show up in the middle of the night to sit in your lobby and charge their phones always ""know someone."" I ask for the name of the guest so I can look them up. Dude gives me a first name, I of course ask for the last name because that's how our system searches. He can't give me one and says that he will when he charges his phone. Yeah, no....

I refer him to the big assed sign right in front of him explaining the lockdown and the whole If you are not a guest, and cannot provide us with who you're here to see, you need to not be here. They didn't like it but went outside. A few minutes later this ""essential"" chick is sneaking them in through one of the side doors. 

A lady came down a few minutes ago freaking out that they think their dog is dying. I start googling emergency vets, I know there are none close, and tomorrow being Sunday no vets offices are gonna be open. While I'm searching she finds a random number somewhere and after contacting them she asked how far Wisconsin is. (about 400 miles btw.) She asks me where the closest people hospital is. I told her and she asked if I thought they would do anything. I didn't like telling her that you have to get screened to even gain entrance to the hospital right now. I gave her a couple other numbers to try and she went back upstairs. I did manage to find a 24 hour emergency vet, still 2 hours away though. 

Then,,, as I'm typing this out, I get a call. Guy asks where the front desk is. It's an outside line so I'm like the entrance is in the center of the building. He then asks what floor. I'm like um,,, 1st floor?

He's confused and he confused the shit out of me so I was like, ""Are you in the building and lost?"". 

That would be weird as we don't have anywhere near a confusing layout, he says no and that he's been walking circles around the building and just can't find it. I was like ""Ok, well,,, we're in the center of the building, right under the giant lighted canopy."" I decided that I was done and probably would be ok if this dude did not find the entrance so I was like ""So before you keep searching, we're only dealing with essential business guests traveling on essential business."" He was a little bummed and said ""So my old lady throwing me out doesn't count..."" then he hung up.

Emergency shelter is essential, but I'm about 100% certain that he was not even at the right hotel, and that I would have had a ""I need a credit card"" fight, so I'm relieved.Even in the middle of a pandemic it's still a Saturday",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Background: I worked at a Full service semi-luxury property before the Covid-19 pandemic. During all of this my position (Sales &amp; Catering Coordinator) was suspended and I was asked to transfer to a smaller mid-rage property that is a different brand. I've been here about a month, well adjusted at this point. 

This guest stayed with us the first week I was at this property and is now back. He's a thirty-something year old man from Asian-decent with broken English, but is very aware of how to annoy the living hell out of someone. 

Get ready for a wall of text.

I'm in the back office (which is literally two steps from the desk. I have 4 Rooms in house, currently working a 7am-11pm shift. I had 30 checkouts today so I'm surrounded by laundry. I hear the front doors open, and before I could drop my King fitted sheet I can hear the man say ""hello, hello..... helllllloooooo"" all before I turn the corner, which was only 4 seconds later. When I walk up front, I smile to greet him and he's now pressing persistently on the bell.

He asks for the rate tonight. 

""$69. Plus Tax.""

""I need AAA discount"" 

""Sure... $61.10""

""What rate for tree night""

Before I could even change the number of nights from one to three, he's asking for four nights. 

""Four nights would be 265.40. That would be your total for the stay.""

""What's the total with tax.""

I just look at him... ""That's the total for the whole stay sir, tax included.""

He looks at me. ""What's the rate per night with taxes for one night.""

I just look at him. ""Tax rate is 11.75%.""

""Wow, that high...""

So, I get him checked in. He chooses the two double beds to save him $6 per night. Cool. He goes upstairs with his wife and I go in the back to folding laundry. I get my king flat sheet lined up with my king fitted sheet and I hear it. ""Hello.... hellllooooooo."" And he hits the bell.

I peek my head up front. ""Yes Sir?""

""We need new room. Bad Air quality in that room.""

""...Air quality?"" This is a first for me. 

""Yes.. Dust everywhere.""

""Sure, no problem."" I change his room. Remake his keys, change his reg card and send him on his way. All is good. 210 has 'bad air quality' and he's now in 212. 

I hear the dryer buzz. I roll my cart to the dryer, unload it, and wheel it to the lobby. As I am approaching the desk, I see that he's back. He sees me coming his way, I'm sure he hears me too, and calls out ""helloooo"" and rings the bell. 

""Yes sir? How's the new room?"" I force through my teeth. 

""Still bad air quality. There is dust.  I need room on third floor.""

""We actually have the third floor powered down right now, so those rooms are unable to be rented. The Covid-19 has effected business..""

""We need room close to elevator but not next to. We need room 214.""

""That room is unavailable, it's actually rented right now.""

""We need room 204. We need on this side of building""

""That room is at the very end of the hallway... do you think the air quality is better there?"" I'm sort of being a smart ass at this point. 

He decides on 216. All is good. I change his reg-card, remake his keys, and send him on his way. 

I switch the laundry from the washer to the dryer and go in the back office area to begin folding another load- and you guessed it. He's back again, ringing the bell and shouting hello.

He ended up asking to be switched back to room 210. I am ready to strangle this guy by now.

In a hotel with less than 3% occupancy I should be able to finish up laundry without all of the interruption. 

Two hours later he comes to the coffee station. He gets three cups of hot water. Drinks one, straight, and takes two up to his room. He comes back down and makes another cup of hot water and drinks it, throwing away yet another cup. He comes over to the store by the desk and picks up every single drink and asks the price of each drink. I try to direct him to the price list on the wall but he insists on asking me each price. 

""Wow, that too much money,"" He says. ""What's the cheapest?""

I point to the 20 oz cokes, which are $3.25. He then reaches for the brown bag, stuffed behind all of the sodas, which happens to be my lunch and tries to open it. 

""How much?""

""Sir.. that's my lunch. It's not for sale.""

He goes back to the coffee station, makes another cup of hot water and drinks it. 20 minutes later, he comes back down to the desk asking for disinfectant for his room. He wants me to come and spray his bathroom with it.

I explain to him that I'm the only person here, and I'm not permitted to go on the floors and into occupied guest rooms. He asks for disinfectant, pointing to floor cleaner sitting on the desk, tries to reach over the counter for it. I redirect him, tell him I'll find disinfectant for him. I explain that the rooms are disinfected when housekeeping services them. He insists on taking it upstairs. He goes upstairs and comes back to return it.

I kid you not, as I'm typing this, He is approaching the desk, asking for the disinfectant because he forgot to spray his closet.

"Tiny bit of background- I work at a 105 room franchised Larriott brand hotel in a college town. Our county isn't under a complete lock down, but all of our bars are closed, restaurants can only offer delivery or curbside pick-up/drive thru, non essential businesses are closed, etc. So, I don't understand why people seem to think that we're immune to the regulations that are currently in place in our city right now. 

We don't offer a continental breakfast during normal times, we have a limited option made to order breakfast that guests pay for if they would like to, however, with everything going on our breakfast kitchen is completely closed until city officials say otherwise. Over the past week we've had several guests check in and ask about breakfast, to which we tell them that we're adhering to local guidelines and that our bar and breakfast kitchen are currently closed, along with our pool and gym. Every single one of these guests have then asked, or damn near demanded, a discount because they thought those amenities would be available. What the actual fuck?!? Anyone else getting these entitled a-holes? I'm not sure how many more times I can respond to someone asking for a discount without losing my shit on them.Entitled jerks still feel entitled during the pandemic",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Covidiot: Someone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety during the Covid 19 pandemic.

Let me preface this by saying that both tales happened to my coworkers and not me. Also we keep our office locked and use the night window to check in guests. With that out of the way let’s get into the douchebaggery.

Covidiot #1: came up from Valdosta Ga and yanked on both doors to the office which have signs and arrows that point to, and say “PLEASE USE NIGHT WINDOW.” Think Eric Andre’s bit from his show where he’s pulling on a fence yelling “Let me in, let me innnn!” 

I’ll call him georgia bob (GB). GB got irate at my FD clerk and started screaming “How the fuck am I supposed to get into the office!?!?” 

My FD advised him that the office is locked and so GB went off complaining and cussing up a storm at her. She held her ground and he finally asked for a room. When he did my badass FD clerk said only if he apologizes to her will he get a room. Georgia Bob got that room. 

Mind you we’re located in GA and although our country bumpkin governor hasn’t done anything of substance to stop the spread, people from here should still know that we will not peak in cases until the end of April/beginning of May. 

Covidiot #2: I’ll call her Michigan Martha (MM). MM and her husband come from Michigan where their governor banned non-essential travel within the state. They were on their way south to FL I assume to spread their fuckery. I’ll willing to bet MM and her husband were probably at the rally of covidiots at their state capital protesting their governor’s shelter in place order the other day. 

MM and hubby pull up in a truck with bumper stickers with witty slogans about Benghazi and not being a liberal. MM walks up to the night window and sees my FD clerk with a disposable mask on (like the one the CDC recommends all to wear). 

She starts getting paranoid from the jump and starts asking my FD why he’s wearing one (behind the night window plexiglass) and says she doesn’t want to stay here due to it, since it’s unnecessary and she assumes that he must be sick if he has it on. 

My FD clerk explains that it’s just a precaution going on the CDC guidelines. This doesn’t phase her so he follows up with a bs lie that our country bumpkin governor Brian Kemp recommends it. I guess at this point a light bulb went off and MM was thinking”Kemp! He’s not a librard! It all makes sense.” So she got the room and later came for some quarters with (You fucking guessed it!) a mask on.

"\[Location: Lobby\]

Enter: Sketchy looking dude

""Hellooo, can I help you"" I said, in a very suspect tone

""uhh yeah get me a room for the night,"" the sketchy guest demanded.

""Yeah, sure it will be 109 plus tax, just need ID and credit card""

The sketchy guest pleaded, ""Don't you have anything lower than that?? My neighbor just shot my dog!""

""uhhhh I'm sorry to hear that?"" I said not knowing if I should believe this sketchy guest or was this the most bizare reason I've heard to negotiate to get a lower rate

""Let me check"" I said while typing and clicking at speeds no one has seen before!

""Yup, looks like our lowest rate is 109 plus tax"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I think that is the most bizarre excuse/reason I should give someone a lower rate. It mostly raised a red flag when I saw his ID and he was from Washington? Like if my neighbor in Washington shot my dog I wouldn't be in Oregon trying to book a room. Also it was kind of early in the day so if the dog was at the vet I would want to be there, or stay at a hotel close? I also asked him later ""did you call the cops??"" and he said he did but like idk wouldn't you want to stay close to where it happened to provide a statement??I think I just got the weirdest reason/excuse to lower our room rates.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Posting on mobile, I apologize for the formatting and wall of text. TL;DR at the end. 

We're doing hskp service every other day, so today is their off day. Of course all of our jacuzzi suites were occupied last night, so of course all of our arrivals, minus 1, for today were for all of our jacuzzi suites. I hate that people are not taking this seriously and just want to get out of the house for the night 😠 Anyway, 2 of the guests were actually decent human beings about the jacuzzi suite not being available, oh but one of them was not.

He comes in around 12:30, which it doesn't matter so much about early check ins now because we are so slow, but it still bothers me. Of course, he booked through third party, so no email or phone number to contact guest. So, I explain unfortunately no jacuzzi suite is available for tonight, however we will be more than happy to switch his room type, or he can cancel with no penalty. Immediately first words out of this guy's mouth ""so can I stay two nights for the price of one? I mean since I would be paying the same amount for a jacuzzi suite anyway?"" NO, I am not doing that. Then of course he starts asking for discounts. What rooms do you have for $60? NONE! YOU HAVE TO BOOK THAT RATE ONLINE!!! This guy was working my nerves. Then he mentions hot breakfast, nope sorry, we haven't done hot breakfast in a month, not going to change any time soon. I ended up saying: no pool, no fitness center, no hot breakfast, you are literally just paying for a room. He eventually ended up booking online the cheapest rate (aka standard room), so I compromised and gave him an upgrade to the next room type.

Oh, another thing he said during this back and forth ""you're about to get me cussed out"" and before I knew it I heard myself say ""right, because it is directly my fault that we don't have any jacuzzi suites available""

I probably should have handled that a little better, but I am sick of locals (and I know he was a local) who KNOW we are under a Stay At Home Order and STILL choose to stay in a hotel room and trash and smoke in it. I am disgusted and sick of it.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, he just got on that nerve with the first words out of his mouth and it snowballed from there 😠

"You already know what this shit's about. 

Standard slow day, working first shift, just browsing Reddit to pass the time. Fairly well off looking fella walks in the front door, comes up to the desk and shoves his phone in my face. It's Shitpedia reservation and booking number.

I ask ""What's your last name sir?"" 

*guest says last name*

At first his name wasn't in my reservations list, so I refreshed my system and it appeared, so he literally JUST made this reservation as he walked in the door. I go through the routine, type his address and everything in, and then we get to the fun part.

""I'll just need your credit card in the machine, it's gonna cover your incidentals. So if you want to get breakfast, park your car, rent a movie, etc, that will be covered by this authorization.""

He inserts his card into the reader(we do $50/night and he's here for two nights, so $100 total), types in his PIN and it comes back declined. 

""Is there another card you wanted to get on file? I can't quite get this one to go through.""

""Hell no, that's my only credit card. I just got off the plane from Cali(we're located in the midwest) and that's the only card I got. Do you take cash?"" as he pulls out a wad of 20s that looked to be at least $5000.

""No, I'm sorry I can only take a credit card for incidentals per Shmilton policy""

""This some bullshit man, I ain't never heard of no hotel taking money when I already paid online, where your manager at?""

""He'll be in at 3, I'm sure he'd be more than happy to help.""

""Man I ain't waiting no mothafuckin' two hours, we gotta fix this now.""

""I'm sorry sir, I need a card on file to check you in. There's an ATM across the street, you could deposit some of the cash and come back, it probably wouldn't take more than five minutes.""

""So how do I cancel this reservation? You know I want my fuckin money back.""

""I see your reservation is through Shitpedia, you would have to call them or go on their website to cancel.""

""Man y'all ain't gonna last long, you gon be out of a job in less than a month, I promise you. I could get a room downtown at another Shmilton and not have to deal with this shit.""(the hotel he's referring to also charges incidentals very much like every other Shmilton on the planet)

*i shrug, not really knowing what to say*

He proceeded to sit down in the lobby, making calls to trash talk the hotel and ask if he could borrow a credit card. After about 30+ minutes of this, he walked to the front door and came back up with a credit card. I checked him in normally and gave him keys to the room.

Seriously, like I guess I understand if you've been living under a rock for 30 years and don't know what an incidental hold is, but berating me and my hotel gets you nowhere. Where the fuck do these people come from ?First hotel in history to charge Incidentals",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Edit: cannot edit title.... Not due to sick

I work at a pretty common chain.  My state has been under a stay at home order since the 23rd of March and business has been very very slow.  I've worked a few. Days but none of them have been like today. So many facepalm moments.

First guest in question:

She and her husband started traveling from Michigan earlier today.  They are headed to Florida because the beaches are open.  She then is like ""I studied nursing and the reactions to this is just dumb.""  As a nursing student I was dumbfounded.  And as I always find things like this said by medical professionals to be a bit (to be nice) off, I had to see if I could find her on FB.  She just got out of rehab and has been delivering for a pizza place for a few years.  Totally open page, nothing related to nursing.  Wondered if she read my visible homework and thought I'd just too on that band wagon.

Second guest in question:
He is also traveling south to ""maybe get some sun before this shit flares up again.""  Yeah dude good to ""not"" be part of the problem.

Third guest in question (and my favorite one of the night):
""Yeah I stay here every Sunday for my church service. Since this thing started you wouldn't believe the increase in attendance.""  Took everything i had to not actually facepalm.  He goes upstairs to put his things away and comes back down to park his car.  On his way back in he looks at me, pretty straight faced and says ""good luck.""  I started laughing (the kind you can no longer contain after many events that just leave you dumbfounded and said ""good luck to you too.""  

I really wish I worked QA for a call center from home like my friend right now.I'm dying (laughter, due to sick) right now",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This guy was a nightmare the whole time he was here. I could get in to a hundred other things he tried to pull but I'm just going to cover his attempt to get a free room twice in a row.

On the day he's supposed to be checking out, he just never left the room. We're ungodly slow due to the pandemic so housekeeping rolled his room (for the uninitiated, ""rolling"" a room means to not clean it the day of checkout and save it for another day when you have more staff). However, housekeeping neglected to verify that he actually left the room like he was supposed to. They just assumed he did and put the room out of order. This is admittedly our fault but still doesnt give him the right to consciously take advantage of the situation.

I knew his face and room number because I'd gotten in to numerous encounters with him already about different things, none of which are relevant. Anyway, around 6pm on his checkout day, I see him dash through the lobby, looking sketchy as hell. I look him up and see his reservation had been checked out so I go up to the room and sure enough, he had left the deadbolt open on the door so he'd be able to get back in. I didn't know where he went or how long he'd be gone so I closed the door and locked him out.

Like 20 minutes later, he comes to the desk FUMING. He immediately started blaming us, trying to frame it to be our fault. First thing he said before I even had the chance to address him when he came to the desk was ""I'm supposed to be checking out tomorrow and my key isnt working!!!!"". That alone was odd, that he immediately got defensive about how he was checking out tomorrow, not today. Then he admits his key wasn't working earlier, which is also weird to admit because if he thought he really had another night, he would have asked to have his keys remade. And if his key wasn't working earlier, how'd he get back in? I called him out on that, to which he just stuttered because he didn't have an answer

There was still a possibility that it was a genuine confusion on his part (although given his actions and the way he was behaving, unlikely) so I didn't come out and say I knew he was trying to cheat us. We went back and forth for probably 5-10 minutes with him accusing us of messing up his reservation. He finally agrees to pay for another night, goes upstairs, and I email my coworkers to watch out for his shit.

The next day, housekeeping tells me they actually DID go up to the room that day and he said he was going to be leaving at 3pm. So that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he knew he was supposed to checkout and was trying to see if he could pull one over on us. And then he has the audacity to try to make me and my coworker feel like it was our fault he got locked out.

And of course, later that next day, he tries THE SAME. EXACT. THING. He told housekeeping he was leaving at 2 (which was communicated to the front desk this time) but when I came in at 3, he was still in the room and the reservation hadn't been checked out. I called him and before I could even say anything, he said ""I'm staying another night. I'll make it right now"". So he was trying the same shit. He knew he was staying over but didn't make a reservation because he wanted to see if he could slip through the cracks.

What a jackass.Guest tries to take advantage of our low occupancy to scam a free room... TWICE",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Seems like I should be happy about this, right? Well hardly anyone is travelling, so all the people coming coming in are locals who should be STAYING THE FUCK HOME!


Yesterday I got about 4 calls from locals making same day reservations. Once I get a call saying ""hey, you got any rooms tonight?"" my instinct is to say ""STAY THE FUCK HOME!"" But I bite my tongue and say I'll take a look. He ends up booking the room.


I come in for the AM shift morning and the night auditor tells me that the guy in room X had his car, keys to his house, wallet, and everything stolen from him by woman. At about 8 o'clock this morning he comes down to the lobby and starts talking my ear off about it. He asks to use the phone to call his daughter to come pick him up but the bank he needs to go to won't open until 9:30. Then he tells me all about what happened, again. I'll give you the rundown but keep in mind this guy talks a bit like Boomhauer from King of the Hill so I can barely understand maybe half of what he says.

1. The woman stole his keys, wallet, and car.

2. He called the police and they found the car, he had to have it towed and it's costing him X dollars per day. 

3. Something about the police or someone else lying about something.

4. He's never cheated on his wife with a prostitute before.

That last bit has me reeling, during a time when you're supposed to practice social distancing banging a prostitute has got to be one of the worst things you can do. Anyway, he rambles on with this on repeat for the full hour and a half hour it takes for his daughter to get here, and since I can barely understand him all I can do is nod my head and say ""Wow. That's crazy."" the entire time.


Not completely uninterrupted though. Part way through I got to take this phone call. Woman calls down from the room asking to extend her stay. I go to extend and it says her card declined. While I tell her this and she's all ""declined?!"" I check the authorization center and it shows we didn't even have authorization for the two nights she already stayed. I apologize and explain that she shouldn't have been checked in like this and she starts going on about how each morning she puts money on the card and checks her statement on her phone and it says we have the money as ""pending"". I get a sinking feeling as I think I know what's going on here. I ask, is this a pre-paid reloadable card? Indeed it is, indeed it is. Again I apologize and explain she should not have gotten checked in with that because it causes these sorts of problems. She argues back and I've been through this shit before, so while I'm yelling I am talking over her saying ""I don't know why your card got past the chip reader, I don't know why it's saying we took your money, all I know is we don't have it."" She says she'll figure it out when she checks out and that she'll go home today (GOOD!) She also asks for a late check out, which I grant. That pisses me off because it means I get to spend the rest of my shift dreading the second half of this conversation. 


My second break from listening to Boomhauer's rambling came in the form of a Karen staying with us along term, asking for towels and sheets. She said she didn't appreciate housekeeping going into her room when she asked them not too. This is odd as we're not doing stay over service unless specifically asked since we're trying to minimize exposure, so I tell her I'll speak to the head of housekeeping. She  also went on about something I didn't understand. We had to charge her one of the first nights she stayed here for a blanket that got such thick stains we couldn't clean them. She was wasn't to make sure she isn't getting ripped off by changing her sheets everyday. I explain to her that we're only charging if the sheets get damaged so bad we can't use them again. Then she starts saying something about how she doesn't know why she can't just let her clean her room? Next she says the TV fell off the dresser and broke a piece on the back. I'm somewhat expecting her to tell me it fell off itself but I ask how that happened and she said her kid did it and she's aware she's responsible. She asks how much it's going to cost to replace and I tell her I'd have to look into it but that I'd rather see if our maintenance person can fix it before charging. I suspect that she's going to say we're buying the most expensive TV we can find to replace it. Later I ask head of housekeeping why the housekeeper was going in her room and she said she kept finding the hugest mess in there each time.


Since I've started typing this I've gotten about 6 calls from locals looking for a room tonight. Each time I ask them to please hold, and have them on hold for about 30 seconds while I go in the back and take deep breaths, so as to stop myself from telling them to STAY THE FUCK HOME!Business has been picking up, we've been getting some much needed revenue, and i hate it.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work at a hotel that regularly attracts some of the sketchier people. We’re located near the rough side of town and somehow they all know someone that works for the brand so they get a super discount rate. 

The past month it’s been unbearably slow. We get 10 check ins and it’s all Pilots. 


Today however has been relatively busy. I have 15 checks Ins that are here on the employee discount alone. 25 check ins total that are not pilots. 

Listen, I get it. People are excited to spend their stimulus check but there is still a stay at home order in affect! There is still the risk of spreading Covid-19. 

I’m getting put in danger because people want “a night away!”

My location has done nothing to protect me. No hand sanitizer, no clorox wipes (we have some but they are locked in GM’s office), no face masks, nothing. 


The way my GM has handled this whole crisis has really made me reconsider working here. My safety doesn’t matter. 

As long as he is safe, that’s all that matters. 

Okay. Rant over.There is still a stay at home order in affect!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We all know those guests, who claims to know the GM if he/she don't get what he/she wants.

This is a story about I 'disarmed' one of those guests.

We were fully booked. The city was host to football (for Americans, soccer) tournament. So we had the officials on one floor and the teams on the other floors. The tournament management had booked all our rooms, so the players could get the rest the needed and focus on the games. So it was nice and easy to work for the 2 weeks they where here. BTW it was a under 19 girls tournament, so LOTS of nice girls in shorts and tight t-shirts to look at. WIN WIN! 

Now to the actual story. 

In comes this 'gentleman'.

Me: Hi, can I help you?

G: Yes, I would like a room for the night.

Me: I'm sorry sir, but we are fully booked.

G: But your parking lot is empty?

Me: Yes, we have 6 soccer teams here, and they all came by bus. (Points at the big roll up with the teams, tournament logo and dates)

G: But they can't have all the rooms?

Me: Sorry, but they do. 

G: You must have one room I can have.

Me: Sorry, I don't. But I can cal...

G: I know your GM, and he told me that I can get a room whenever I want one!

*Our GM is a woman,and she had been there for 3 years or so, so I knew he was full of BS. But I played along. I wanted to see how far he would go.*

Me: I sorry, but I just can't give you one of the rooms. They are all booked. But I can call....

G: *getting more angry* I'm gonna call your GM and tell him to order you to give me a room then fire you. *He almost spat the last part.*

Me: Well, if you want to call (the GM before our current, let us call him Brian) Brian, you are more than welcome to do that.

*I liked our old GM very much. He would rather lose a 'friend', than have a 'friend' demand a room and talk 'down' to his staff just because they knew each other from the golf club etc etc.*

G: I will call uhm... Brian right now!

Me: Go ahead and call. *Looks at him like I was just waiting for him to call.* BTW our GMs name is Sara (not her real name), and she has been here for 3 years this fall. If you want a room at Brians hotel you are in the wrong city. I can give you the phone number for the hotel and you can have a coffee to go for the trip.

The 'gentleman' looks at me in chock, he knows he has been busted. Storms out of the hotel in such a hurry, I don't get to give him the phone number or the coffee for the trip.

One of the officials (VERY nice lady) from the tournament heard the last part of the and asked what it was about. So I told her the story. She and I got a good laugh, and I got her number. We are still good friends, without benefits. 

How have you guys busted a 'I know your GM' guest? I would love to read your stories.I know the GM!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, because of the virus, my property has strictly adapted a “no cash” policy. We didn’t take cash anyways except for at check out, but now we won’t take it at all. The thought is that it will deter the “riff-raff” away fully. Which it’s not, but it give us some leverage on who to rent to. 

I’m work the desk tonight, and a woman comes in to check in. She wants to pay cash. I politely tell her we do not accept cash. She hands me a card that does not have her name on it. I politely tell her we do not accept cards that do not have a name on them. She throws what my dad has dubbed a “bacon fit”. Stomping her foot, shaking her body, basically one gigantic temper tantrum. I apologize again, and she asks if we have an ATM so she can pull out money to put on her bank card. I direct her to the ATM. She pulls out cash, and leaves. When she returns, I try to run her bank card 3 different times. Each time the card declines. Each time the lady gets more and more frustrated. 

Now, at this point, it’s important to the story for me to mention that I am a white woman, and she is a black woman. She then tells me “now I am being really patient with you. I hope you’re not doing any of this on purpose.” I look at her, and tell her “Ma’am, I have a sign posted stating we do not take cash. Additionally we have a sign over here stating our credit card requirements. And, I do not have the power to make our system decline your card. So I can assure you, I am not doing any of this on purpose.” 

At this point, I try her card for a 4th time, and it declines. When I tell her, she LOSES HER SHIT.  Screaming at me as to why I’m making this happen, that I’m rascist, etc. I tell her unfortunately, due to her behavior, she is no longer welcome to stay at our property. This causes her to lose her shit even more, screaming that I’m a racist white bitch, and I’m a fat white bitch who can eat a bag of dicks. She continues to harass myself and my employee for several minutes over the phone after she’s left. Needless to say it really put a damper on my night. 

Fast forward two hours later. My employee checks the business center, where the ATM happens to be, during his cleaning for the night, and there is a 20 just chilling in the tray! Nobody else has used the ATM since she did. We split it, and got a damn good laugh at the fact that karma won the day. Thanks for the tip lady!!!Karma is REAL!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
" 

I have been a night auditor for 6 years, also doing housekeeping and breakfast when needed or day shifts to fill in. I have done many things to help sales over the years such as rate calling, group resumes and wedding signs... I would like to go into sales but my last interview I had, the GM belittled me saying I didn't have the skills to go into sales. I have a BA in French and MBA in International Business. I have two brands ( one that starts with an H and one that starts with an I ) and worked at an independent hotel.

Any suggestions on what I can do better for an interview?

There wont be any openings any time soon at the property I work at...

"DISCLAIMER:  I wear gloves at work all the time, especially when handling money and especially now. I’m not worried about myself getting COVID-19, but I am aware of the critical need to wear a mask. However, I do have serious SERIOUS asthma(yes I know I am in the population of people who are at greater risk for it) wearing a mask restricts the air flow to my lungs, it feels like I’m being suffocated by a pillow when I wear a mask
(yes I’ve been suffocated by a pillow, I am one of the middle children out of 6 kids you’re bound to get suffocated by somebody) 
If you tell me to wear a mask, I will wear a mask, but if you tell me I don’t have to wear a mask, I will take that route so I don’t pass out in front of a guest. It almost happened before, luckily the woman was a nurse, so she actually told me to remove the mask and breathe and try not to wear it.  So, please be aware of that when reading this story. 


So, everybody aware of COVID-19, the bastard ruining our lives! Well, my work made me wear a mask once to work, ok no big deal, they said to wear it whenever checking somebody in and stuff, but I can remove it when I am done, so I can breathe, ok cool. They also said I only had to wear it for one day, because they got this giant glass put in place in front of us; so they don’t have to buy masks and they can go to who truly needs them. Ok fair. I wear a mask one shift, no big deal, however, I almost faint from not getting enough air I will say. YAY! Next day, the giant piece of glass is in place, nobody around the office is wearing a mask. Including management.  I CAN BREATHE 

So, two weeks go by, I come into work and see a note stating it is required we wear a mask and if we don’t, our hours will be cut. 

They never provided us with masks, if it’s a requirement, it should be provided by the work in my opinion. 

Well, I don’t have a mask. My entire city is out of masks of all types. It never occurred to me to make a homemade mask, because I honestly haven’t left my house since the stay at home order has been in place, and I live with my mom, so she goes to the grocery store and she wears a mask. Also, when getting gas, I just pay from the pump. Never occurred to me to get a mask. I am the biggest introvert of all time. I stand more than 6 feet away from people if I can. So, I remembered today before work, I needed to get a mask. But, where do I get a mask? So, I texted my boss and said, “hey where do I get a mask or how do I get a mask? This policy change was thrown at the last minute, help me out please”, annnddddd she just starts bitching me out for no reason, and saying I should have had a mask at work the entire time and shit. 

YOU SAID I DIDN’T NEED A MASK BECAUSE OF THE GLASS YOU PUT IN PLACE 

I explained to her why I never had a mask, and that she never told me to get a mask after the glass was up, because we’re basically not allowed to move out away from the glass. She told me she did tell me to get a mask and that she told me in person on Wednesday. 

I didn’t work Wednesday.

I told her I didn’t work that day, she said she texted me.

She hasn’t texted me in a while actually, and I take screen shots of hour conversation with her phone number depending on the topic, along with me keeping all of her texts. She never texted me.

She told me to pay the head housekeeper to have her make me a mask. Ok I don’t mind that, anything to help a co worker out but...why aren’t you paying her? You’re making it a requirement? And, you also threw this on me at the last minute and you’re just yelling at me for not knowing? Lady, we don’t have our normal communication system anymore! It was an online system, that if you wanted to, you can log in on from your phone and read what’s been going on. Well, I did that every morning, especially if I’ve been off for 2-3 days; we got rid of that system to cut back on spending, and went to a notebook communication. So, we don’t know anything until we are at work. She claims I should’ve known before I came into work that day, 

BITCH WE DO NOT HAVE OUR NORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ANYMORE, AND I ASKED YOU WHAT TO DO, A SIMPLE QUESTION 

I don’t understand why it’s so hard to answer a simple question, I don’t understand why it’s so hard to tell me what to do if I don’t have access to a mask, instead of bitching at me left and right, when I asked a question. Also, we have masks at our work, they won’t give them to us though. So, if I ask for a mask that’s locked away, it’s an automatic “no they’re not for you to use”,  but you’re threatening my hours when you have a mask to provide? Also, she claimed I was trying/starting an argument. If you read the texts, you can tell, I was actually being very nice and just asking a question. Also, I through in some jokes not involving the masks, I was clearly just asking for help or guidance. Nope. I was “purposely arguing”, no bitch I was asking a question, you asked why I never had a mask, I explained myself, YOU BITCH ME OUT AUTOMATICALLY 

I am currently looking for my HR’s number on the internet, I have been here for three years and I have fucking had it. I bite my tongue and do what they ask, even if it’s ridiculous, I’ll still do it because they pay me good. At this point, the pay isn’t worth it. I like working in hotels though, so I might just start looking for a different hotel to work at. One that has two people on staff at all times. And, no manager that bitches at me for asking ONE FUCKING QUESTIONA simple question turned into me getting yelled at",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm a Night Auditor. This being r/talesfromthefrontdesk, you all know what that means so I'm not going to explain it overly much. Well, my property is in the middle of nowhere so, from the time I relieve Afternoon shift until the time Morning shift relieves me, I'm the only employee on-property. No management, no security officer (not that we have one of those), no maintenance, no one but me. I also try _really_ hard not to bother management unless it's an emergency that I don't have the experience to deal with. This rarely happens. As a result, I have a tendency to...adjust things that bother me when I have nothing better to do. Management usually doesn't say anything unless I go too far and, even then, they have a habit of staying the way I changed them to. But you're here for a tale. So here's a tale.

When all of this COVID stuff was just getting started in the US, the governor issued a 10 person maximum for public gatherings. Our breakfast had already been limited to grab-and-go and guests were being _encouraged_ to eat in their rooms, but you wouldn't know it by looking at our dining room. So, I decided I needed something to do to kill a couple hours and spent the time putting all the chairs up on the tables to make it absolutely clear that the dining room was closed. I finished that _way_ faster than I thought I would and thought to myself, _""You know, the couches and chairs in the lobby area are awfully close together. And we don't really want people lingering there either.""_ So...I proceeded to put the the smaller couches together, one on top of the other so they couldn't be used and then also flipped the end tables on top of the larger couches. When I was done, the only usable seating in the entire lobby was the business center. The next afternoon I received a text message from my FDM, ""In the future, please do not move furniture without express permission from management.""

Apparently, it had caused a bit of a scene. Everyone agreed that the couches had to go back to normal so that was no issue, but the dining room was another story. One of the back-office managers didn't like the chairs being put up in the dining room, another did. Apparently between the two of them and maintenance they went up and down three or four times over the morning until the GM provided the tie breaker vote and the chairs stayed up. But they couldn't figure out how I had stacked the chairs until the morning shift front desk told them. By the time I came in that night, the chairs in the dining room were up, the couches were down, and I derived great amusement from imagining ""Yakety Sax"" playing as they put the dining chairs up and down all morning.

As a continuation of the theme, yesterday they decided that Front Desk should fold laundry to keep us busy since we're so slow. They put this giant folding table in the back office right in the way of everything for people to fold laundry at, piled high with towels and the like of course. Well, tonight I got sick of trying to work around it and have now moved it. The table is now in the back-office hallway next to the managers offices and out of the way (don't worry, it's not in their way either). We'll see if I hear anything tomorrow.I may be a bit too independent",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey my FD peeps. I'm temporarily laid off but thought I'd share a cute story to bring up some spirits.

When I worked in one of my pet friendly properties we had this lady who would always check in with this beautiful Shiba Inu. The baby was black, always perfectly groomed and looked so soft and touchable.  (Also very well behaved. Always sat when told, didn't run off, always listen to the owner; pawfect guest).
Always wanted to pet the baby, so I'd offer treats (with the owners consent of course ) and pet the baby.
I was young and in hindsight the owner was probably annoyed by me because I LOVED her dog.
Anyways one day the owner was in a good mood and was like, 
""do you want to see her do a trick?""
Hella yah!
She gave her dog her ID and CC and the dog put it on the desk and used its nose to push it over to me. AND when I gave the lady the keys she asked the dog to grab it and give it to her.  

It was amazing. Makes me smile.

Edit: WOAH an award really! For a dog check in?!Gotta talk about dogs more often thank you :)

Edit: WHAT?!?! So many awards! I'm dead guys. thank you!Dog checks into the hotel. Litterally",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This happened about two years ago. We were sold out and housekeeping was trying to flip rooms as quickly as possible. Karen uses mobile check in, but her room isn’t ready. She has a king reserved. I offer her a room with two beds that is ready but she refuses and demands why her room isn’t ready because she used mobile check in. I let her know of course that mobile check in still a request. She leaves and says she’ll come back later. 

A few minutes later she calls and screams and demands to speak to a manager. My supervisor bumps someone, lets her check in. 

The next day she comes down, screams at me in the lobby, says she is going to call corporate complain and specifically mention me by name. Thankfully my GM of all people happens to be walking through the lobby during her tirade and witnesses this and even tries to speak with her and give her his card but she now that she’s in full Karen mode, nothing is going to stop her from “speaking to corporate directly,” because my “customer service skills are poor and I need more training.” 

So the review comes in and Karen was true to her word and apparently it was like the nastiest review. To be honest I chose not to read it because I have anxiety depression and can ruminate over things and I really didn’t want that negativity in my life. It did, however, prompt a few of the execs to come over and give me a hug. That’s how bad it was. 

As per protocol, Customer Care did reach out to the property but my FOM did defend me and basically told them that even though Karen was checked into a room right after she complained, she continued to abuse the staff. 
I did cry a little bit, but life goes on and I moved on. 

Unbeknownst to me, Karen gets a generic “Give us another try for a better review,” comp slip (because that’s hospitality for you) and books another stay with us six months later. 

Unbeknownst to Karen, I was never fired or  even written up because of her shenanigans (because that’s hospitality for you and 90% of our job is putting up with bullshit), no matter how well she slept at night thinking I was.

So on that fateful day, I had actually graduated to phones at that point and was only doing backup front desk. My coworker rang for me and I headed up and I see a woman with her back turned (it should be noted that this Karen did not have the typical Karen haircut so I didn’t recognize her right away) When I ask if she needs assistance she turns around, I recognize her right away and she recognizes me and the look on her face is pretty fucking awesome. She is in complete shock that I’m still there and I’m not fired even though she “spoke to corporate and mentioned me directly by name.” It’s all on her face. 

So our exchange goes something like this:

Me: Hi how may I assist you?

Karen: Yes I need a microwave sent to my room.

M: Sure! (I smile really big) May I get your last name? 

K: Bitchface.

M: And your first name? 

K: Karen 

M: Okay Ms. Bitchface, one microwave coming right up. May I assist you with anything else? 

K: (gives me a long dirty look) No thank you.
(Stomps off)

I pretended I didn’t know her because I didn’t want her to think she got under my skin and that she was just one of many guests and I’m sure it made her furious. I’m glad that she saw that her temper tantrums and ugly review didn’t ruin someone’s life and get them fired from their job like she thought it would (although sure it’s not the first time she has tried). 

Fuck you, Karen. 

Another happy ending: I graduated from the front desk to the accounting department where I worked in a basement and no one came to see me. It was awesome (and I hope I can go back soon).I didn’t get you fired?? But...but I spoke with corporate!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"First time poster and this story is semi long. This is how I remember it and the conversation might not be exact.

I was working the 3-11 shift and since this pandemic has started I’ve been cut down to only 1 to 2 days a week since I’m pregnant, but still be able to keep my insurance to keep going to my doctor appointments. Normally, we would have maintenance and/or houseman on duty because in normal circumstances March is a pretty busy month , but for some reason I was alone that night. I didn’t have a lot of check ins, only a few people.A gentlemen and his friend came wandering in at around 9PM. I was in my bosses office because his office had the only comfy chair and my back was really hurting, also so I could watch the security cameras if someone came in. It was a really quiet night. 

I quickly went out there to greet them and from the moment he came in he was just irate. At this time, I was wearing a face mask already for the sake of my husband and also for my own comfort. I asked the gentleman if he just booked the room and which site he went through since I didn’t see his reservation in the system or in our email yet. I did find it eventually and told him it would take a few minutes to input in the system.Just note that the gentleman had a heavy French accent and I had my mask, which made it hard to communicate, let alone convey facial expressions. I asked to see a photo ID and credit/debit card.

Guest: Please. You are being super rude to us, you didn’t greet us when we came in (*I did*) You work a minimum wage job, and you are being unprofessional. 

Saying while getting super close to desk, slamming his hand against the desk, and ignoring the signs that are posted to remind guest of the 6 foot rule and social distancing.

OP: How am I being rude, sir? All I asked was who did you book through and for your photo ID/ Credit Card to check you in.

Guest: We had an 18 hour long flight, we are tired, and I’m sick. You have been rude to us and doesn’t seem like you even want to be here. You know *pointing at my mask* masks don’t actually protect you and you look pretty stupid for wearing it.

OP: Again how was I being rude, sir?

Guest’s voice was increasingly getting louder, but not quite yelling while his friend was silently agreeing with him. Also he was finally pulling out his passports and credit card. At that point I took one look at his stuff and just pushed it back towards him. 

OP: I do not appreciate the way you have been speaking to me and I do not want you staying here. You have been extremely rude to me, please leave. 

Guest: We are not going anywhere. I have not been rude to you, you would know if I was being rude to you. We paid through X’s site and I want to make sure I’m not being charged... I want to be refunded right now!

OP: Sir X’s site does not do pre-paids , and doesn’t collect your payment, the hotels does when you check in. You have not been charged. I do not want you here and I’m refusing you service, please leave.

Finally taking the hint he started to grabbing his stuff and leaves or so I thought. While he was gone, I started cancelling his reservation. He came back a second later. 

Guest: I want your manager’s information I’m going to call him first thing tomorrow morning to tell them how unprofessional you were being. Also I want proof that my reservation was cancelled and I wasn’t charged.

OP: Go ahead, sir and again I did not charge your card. I am canceling your reservation right now, please leave now. 

I grabbed my manager’s card with all his information and he demanded to know my name so I gave it to him. The guest and his friend finally left. Usually when a guest is rude , I usually brush it off and hurry to get them in the room (*I am kind of a pushover*), but we are in the middle of a pandemic. This is already a stressful time, and to make it worse by being rude is insane. Also at the time I was only 6 weeks pregnant and was not allowing dumb people to stress me out or yell at me without putting them on the undesirable lists and was easy irritable due to mood swingsI Had To Walk My First Guest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello! I hope everyone is well during these trying times. This story happened a few months back in Jan, but now that I have time to sit and write this I thought I’d give it a go. This is gonna be a long one.

Here’s backstory for you. I work(ed) as a GSA in a pretty high scale resort with a total of 6 dining options, that’s not including in-room dining and our gift shop that has a limited selection of snacks and whatnot. All dining options are pretty good at inclusivity when it comes to vegetarian/vegan options, diet restrictions, and of course food allergies. Also, we have the largest convention center in the city, at the beginning of every year is what we call “conference season” because pretty much every weekend is sold out till mid April. One thing that we ALWAYS get dragged for is the absence of microwaves in the standard rooms. We have them in our larger “Casitas” as an added amenity and because they’re “house like” and a bit more spaced out from other close by rooms. Some would argue to just put some cheap microwaves in the standard rooms because it’s a big resort and of course there’s money to spare. But there’s been a number of issues before ranging from electrical (it’s an old resort) and smell complaints. Also, it’s a full service resort! We have hot a ready made food for you to enjoy! However, we can make exceptions, such as a family who needs to warm up milk for their babies, or food allergies. When available, we can make exceptions and go into an out of order Casita and put a microwave into their room. But on sold out nights when there isn’t an out of order Casita, that’s when things get a little tricky...

Also, did I mention this guest was a member of the largest group in-house? We’ll call this lovely individual RL (rude lady)

RL walks up to the front desk clutching a bag of microwaveable rice
RL: “You know, I find it absurd and ridiculous that you don’t provide a microwave in your rooms for those with food allergies. I have been walking around asking your restaurants to heat up my food and they are refusing to help! I just want to eat!”

Me: “I apologize, I will call my Maintenance staff to check and see if we have a microwave that we can put into your room. After that, I can contact my food and beverage manager to see if there is a dish they can prepare special to your needs.

RL: *gags* Oh god no, I am not eating at any of your restaurants, just walking by their doors makes me gag! They reek of garlic. Every single one of them.

Me: “I understand, let me reach out to Maintenance.”

I call maintenance the the Maintenance Director (MD) picks up.

MD: “Oh sure! Let me check. If not I’ll have my boys run over to Home Depot and grab a new microwave. We need more anyways!”

Me: “Awesome! Thank you so much!”

With a sigh of relief I hang up the phone, and I happily exclaim to RL what we are willing to do for her. She just stares at me blankly and I’m taken aback by what she says.

RL: “Un-f*cking believable. I can’t take a new microwave. The smell of new appliances and the plastic makes me nauseous. I’ve had that happen to me many times before. I demand you have the restaurant heat it up for me!”

At this point I’ve had enough already

Me: “The restaurants legally cannot do that due to liability reasons and a number of health code violations. Our maintenance team are offering to go buy an entirely new microwave just so you can enjoy. If you cannot accept that offer, I’m not sure what else we can do for you.”

RL: “I cannot believe this, I need to speak to someone higher than you who can make that happen. You just don’t understand what it’s like to have a disability. You have it so easy. I hope one day that something happens to you, or your kids so you know how it feels to live with a disability, and I hope it’s soon. Get someone else out here for me, right now.” 

Me: “Of course. I will be back in one moment.”

I go and grab my manager (who actually just started a few weeks prior) and when I tell her what happened, I can’t hold back the tears and she immediately has my back and says “Oh hell no” and goes to talk to this lady. 

Turns out, my new manager has severe seafood and dairy allergies and explains that to the woman while ripping her a new one.

Manager to RL: “I am going to make this one exception and walk back to the kitchen, and heat this up myself.”

RL: “I’m coming with you, because now you’re probably going to poison it or something.”

Manager: “Look, I don’t care, come with me if you’d like. But I will have you know, that I have severe allergies as well and I would NEVER say what you said to my employee to anyone. She is currently crying in my back office because you said such hateful things.”

RL: “I didn’t mean to make her cry-“

Manager: “Well you did. If you have any other concerns please address them to me and only me for the remainder of your stay.”

When the word got back to her group coordinator. The coordinator came up to the front desk and apologize for the way we were treated by RL, and that felt really nice. Idk if she was going to be punished or anything but I’d like to think she did. 

Two days later RL came up to the front desk and asked for two complimentary bottles of water and then as she was leaving she turned around to me and said: “Oh yeah, and I’m sorry for yesterday...” and walked away. She couldn’t even remember what day it was lol.

I knew going into this business that you should never take anything personal. But this just really got to me and I think about it quite often now. I’m lucky and grateful to not have any allergies that I know of and I would never deliberately make someone feel ashamed for having them. I have close friends that have severe allergies and always take that into consideration when eating out and preparing food with them. I was very fortunate to have a manger that was willing to stick up for me and be there. It was a great first impression and she’s the best. 

Sorry for this being so long, and I appreciate you reading one of my many stories! Have a good day, and stay safe :)

TLDR: Lady with food allergy couldn’t get a used microwave in her room so she hoped that me or my future children would have a disability.Girl with a food allergy cursed me and my future children",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This was a post I made as a comment some weeks ago but I figured more people would enjoy reading about the security guard at the hotel I interned at. This man was like 55 by the way, not a dumb kid.


Before I started there he was working with our breakfast attendant and when she had her back turned decided that he needed to know what was inside of the PAM canister. So naturally, he cuts it open with a can opener. PAM goes EVERYWHERE. Behind appliances, on every surface. As soon as it happened he started apologizing profusely! The attendant isn’t mad at all she’s just standing there laughing her butt off. The security guard was supposed to be out by 7am, didn’t leave till 10am because he insisted on cleaning his mess himself.

He also apparently didn’t learn that when using a blender you should put the top on it. Apparently took him 5 or so tries to learn that as he ran it many times with no top, and every time yogurt and fruit chunks got shot all over.

He also forgot about stuff he put in the oven for breakfast on multiple occasions. (he worked 11p-7a so he started the breakfast for the attendant). Breakfast was delayed several times for that reason.

He’s also fallen in pools as have his keys, he locked himself outside the hotel a few times. I found him stuck inside a bathroom stall once.

Also he flipped the “off” switch on the elevator once when it got jammed. This caused the elevator to lower itself to the ground floor at a “slow” speed but one which was of great concern to the guests trapped inside. From then until the day he was laid off he had standing orders to just call 911 or the chief of maintenance of the elevator jammed.

The more I think about him, the more I think he may be related to Kevin.

Also sadly he was terminated after I left. They eliminated the Assistant GM, Maintenance Manager, Housekeeping Manager and Security Guard positions to save money. Apparently anyone working from 3pm(ish) to 7am(ish) is normally alone.Incompetent Security Guard",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm so irritated right now. I swear I'm going to lose my shit if Guest A contacts me one more time. I'm honestly so irritated that I can't even think of a witty intro, so here's the story.

Guest A calls to make a noise complaint against the room next to them (Guest B). I go down the hall and listen. It's a little loud so I ask Guest B to quiet down. They apologize and quiet down. Guest A calls back less than 15 minutes later with another noise complaint about Guest B. I go back down and can't hear anything from the room other than very quiet talking. I call Guest B and ask them to quiet down just a little bit more. They apologize again and tell me they didn't think they were being loud, they were just talking at a normal volume. I told them I appreciated them quieting down and apologized that Guest A was being a prick (not in those words).

Guest A calls back again 20 minutes later and is being a giant prick yelling about how I'm not doing my job by making them be quiet. I offer to move Guest A to a different room and they decline saying that I need to make Guest B move rooms. I tell them that I can't force Guest B to move rooms, the best I can do is move Guest A away from them. Guest A tells me that they're going to get the room comped completely in the morning and complain to my manager about how I'm not doing my job. Guest A demands that I have my manager call him right now. I tell Guest A that I will not be doing that and that he can speak to the manager tomorrow when he gets here.

I go down again and listen outside of Guest B's room and hear absolutely nothing, not even talking. I call my manager at this point and ask him what to do. He tells me to leave Guest B alone and if Guest A calls again to tell him that the only thing we can do is move him, we will not be moving Guest B. I tell him that is what I already told Guest A and that's when Guest A snapped and said I'm not doing my job and he'll be sure to tell my manager about that tomorrow. My manager laughed and said he knows that I do my job and not to worry about it, he knows who this guy is because he's stayed here a couple times before and has always been an asshole. He also said that we will not be comping the room and to make sure to pass that on to the morning girl for when he comes up and complains to her.

I still have 6 arrivals that I'm waiting for, I don't have time to run up and down the hall over these fake ass complaints. I'm off for 3 days after tonight and I'm so ready to go. Hurry up last 5 and a half hours. I'm fucking done!

Edit: Call number 4 just took place around 10 minutes ago. It was the wife this time saying ""I know they aren't trying to be loud but they are, please make them stop"". Went back down to listen outside the room. Not a single sound was coming from it. Offered to move her room (once again). Guest declined (once again).

Edit: Guest A came up to the desk to yell at me for not doing my job in an acceptable manner. I told him that he wasn't going to yell at me and that he can talk to the manager when he comes in but I won't be talking to him anymore if he's going to yell at me. Guest told me (as he's walking away because he's a little bitch that wouldn't say it to my face) ""oh I'll be sure to talk to him. I stay here all the time and I'm sure you're going to get fired after he hears that you're not taking your job seriously"". I decided to look at his history because I've never seen him or his name in the system before. He's been here 3 times. 3 times!!! The first was in 2014, second in 2019, and now today.




Final Edit for 04/17: My shift is over!!! I'm back home and made sure to provide detailed notes to my relief. I also made sure to let her know that our manager said do not give them any kind of discount or comp anything, he will deal with them when he comes in. He said they won't be getting any discounts from him either because they didn't move when I gave them the option and he knows that there was nothing else I could do since Guest B wasn't making any noise. I'm off until Monday night so if there's any updates to give, I'll update it then. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment on this! It feels so good to talk about it with people who understand how unrealistic and unreasonable some people can be.Guest keeps calling to complain about noise coming from next to him.

"I used to work at a medium sized hotel in a small town in the Midwest.  It was the only hotel in town the next one was about 20 minutes away next town over.

This night I was working alone on PM shift when an older man comes in (not elderly just older) and asks about rooms and prices.  I give him the information and he says ""This is highway robbery!"" I offer AAA or AARP discounts but still too high.  He wants me to change the price.  I explain that we can't do that and he leaves in a huff.  A minute later he comes back limping and with a cane.  Now he walked in the door the first time no problem and stood at the desk shouting at me with no difficulty.  Now he walks in with a newly acquired limp.  He asks about prices and I tell him that they are the same.

"Alright Reddit, prepare yourselves. Today is the day I bestow upon you the tale of Wednesday Guy.

I work Night Audit (11pm-7am) so I usually don't see very many people while at work. I also recently switched hotels, so this happened while I was still getting used to the new space. My shifts were Tuesday and Wednesday nights (now Saturday and Sunday, but that's not important).

Let me set the scene. It's early Thursday morning, around 2am. I'm literally seconds away from running the audit, when HE arrives. This man was large. Obscenely large. Dressed in a t shirt and sweats (in the winter) and he smells AWFUL.

He looks at me and goes ""Who the hell are you?""

I was a bit taken aback, but I thought that maybe he was a regular who just didn't recognize me. ""Oh, I'm new.""

He scoffs and says, ""You must be REALLY new, I've never seen you before.""

""Yep, I just started this week."" (This was literally my third night at the new hotel.

He doesn't say anything, just sets his bag down and takes a seat in the lobby. I asked for his name and he got irritated because I didn't know who he was. Turns out, he stays every Wednesday night. 

I got everything squared away for his reservation, and I asked for his credit card. He doesn't say anything, just extends his arm with his card in his hand. Okay..

I awkwardly leave the front desk, walk around our snack store (through two doors) to grab his card. In my head I'm thinking, ""This guy can't stand up and walk two feet like everyone else?""

I swipe his card, all is good, and I give him his keys. Now, this would be the time he would get up and go to his room, right? No, of course not, why would he do a silly thing like that?

No, he starts hitting on me (??) Honestly, I don't know if he was ACTUALLY hitting on me, or just being creepy, but whatever. Bear in mind, I'm 19 at the time, and he's in his mid 50s.

My age comes up, and he tells me he wants to take me out for my first drink when I turn 21. Then he says he'd take me out for coffee whenever I'd like, his treat. How nice!!

He continued making me feel like I needed at least seven showers before I managed to get him to leave me alone. That, my friends, was the first night I met him. I have SO MUCH MORE SHIT to write, but this post is long enough. If anyone is actually interested, I'll make more posts about Wednesday Guy.Wednesday Guy",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"[Part Uno](https://old.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/g25yej/yall_know_damn_well_how_many_cameras_we_have_and/)

So I came in to work today eager to find out what had transpired with the lies and the lying liars who lied them. I didn't ask if they tried to extend or not, so you'll just have to leave that to your own imagination.

But after they left the owner called them to inform them they were no longer welcome. They argued, insisting that they'd done nothing wrong. They had been harassed and had their gas stolen!

No, the boss reminded them. *They* moved the cones. They denied this, and he informed them that there was a camera that had a perfect shot of them moving the cones. They changed tactics, and argued that if they weren't supposed to park there, they should be told.

Gee, if only someone put something bright orange and cone shaped in the parking space so people would know not to park there.

The boss says this, albeit less eloquently. Probably ""That's what the cones are for,"" and possibly followed by ""dumbass.""

Now I have to interrupt my own story because a new development happened while I was writing it. The phone rang. I answered, and the person asked to speak to the manager. I informed him that I am a manager, and what did he need?

He says he doesn't need A manager, he wants THE manager. I tell him THE manager isn't here. What does he need, I may be able to assist him. He refuses to tell me. I tell him in that case I can't help him, and he will need to call tomorrow and ask for the owner.

He starts talking about an ""incident"" that happened this morning, and I realize it's Liar Magoo and his girlfriend too, in the background. He says he's Lieutenant something or other, and at first I thought he was pretending to be a police officer, and did my best to stifle my laughter.

Then using the best bullshit tech jargon he could muster together with his few brain cells and fewer teeth, he tried to tell me some nonsense about how our cameras are wrong. Because of the angle of the camera, there is a ""two to four foot variance."" Because of this, the cone really was where he said it was. The camera is wrong.

Now, I'm not a camera expert. But I'm pretty sure there is no angle that is going to make a bright orange cone sitting between two white lines on black pavement look like it's anywhere other than where it actually is. But you know what? I'll let you decide. [After all, we have cameras.](https://youtu.be/iagYHIZ8vz0)

Anyway, I say basically this to him. Loudly, because he's trying to spout off his nonsense about variance. I have no patience for bullshit, so I demanded he be quiet while I speak, and apparently rolled a nat 20 on intimidate because he shut the hell up for the first time. And I said my piece. He tries to spout off that the manual for the cameras will tell me about this nonsense variance he's made up. Yeah, no it won't. He couldn't even tell me what the brand of the cameras is.

He said the contractor who put the cones behind the car was harassing his girlfriend this morning, which no he wasn't. He tried to joke with her about the cones, and she got mad. Then he informed me the car was worth a lot more than the cones and like, duh, it's a fucking car. He asked me what I would have done in that situation had it been my car, and I told him I wouldn't be in that situation. I wouldn't have moved the cone in the first place.

And he argues that he'd never seen them use the cones to reserve parking. That they usually used them in front of the tongue of their trailer (also seen in the video). I tell him it doesn't matter what he's seen. They're allowed to use those cones to reserve space. Also, you're a liar.

He goes on to call me a liar. I ask him if I'm a liar, why was he trying to pretend to be a police officer? Lieutenant something or other? And here I'll admit I was wrong, because unlike them that's something I'm capable of. I'd forgotten his name since they always stay under hers.

He was just giving me his name with his military rank, as if it matters outside of the military. Especially when you're no longer in the military. Not to mention this man is in his fifties (with a twenty something girlfriend, gross y'all, but there's no accounting for taste. Also she smoked while pregante, so fuck her). If you exited as a lieutenant, it's probably been a good long while since you were in the army. But thanks for proving the army really will take anyone.

He then started spouting off about how he was in the military and that's why he had the dog, and we didn't charge him for the dog, and blah blah... yeah I wasn't paying attention. I interrupted him saying no one gives a shit about the dog. We're talking about the cones he moved.

And he got really mad that I don't care that he was in the army. And that I kept interrupting him to call him a liar and make him mad. Which was pretty easy. His temper is as short as he is, and he was mad he wasn't getting his way.

He said he'd call in law enforcement, either local PD or military and ""we'd see how much drugs all your nice little construction workers do!"" I responded with a laugh and ""ok."" Then he called me a fat bitch, which is true. Fat bastard was taken so I went with bitch. I told him to have fun sleeping in his car. Then hung up. Then I called my boss and we had a good laugh about how dumb they are.

Speaking of my boss, back on to his conversation with them this morning:

Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle dumber then tried to say their car had been vandalized. And I'd like to think my boss said C A M E R A S. Followed by BITCHES. Because he's from Joisey, and it seems like the kind of thing he'd do. They did not try to claim a two to four foot variance might make it seem like someone who was not near the car was actually somehow stealing their gas.

Later in the morning the owner talked to the supervisor, who was surprised to hear we were kicking the couple out. He said it wasn't necessary, but we assured him that this wasn't about the cones. It was all about their bullshit.

Anyway, still waiting for the cops and the military to get here. It's been an hour. They have got to work on their response time.Liars 2: Electric Boogaloo. A Thrilling Follow Up, But Not A Conclusion. Maybe.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"The amount of pissed off I am right now doesn't amount to how much I want to smoke a fat bowl right now, because I have been at work for 2 hours, and I am already about to kick a bitch out.

This woman was in my lobby yelling at her 16 year old kid, and telling her she was a useless human being. The kid looked depressed as shit and was trying not to cry. Why the mom was yelling? Well, the daughter was answering a text message while waiting for her mom to get done in our business center. So, I guess I had a look of ""what is wrong with you bitch"", on my face on accident, my brain reacting to a shit person like that doesn't turn off easily. That made the girl smile a little bit. I guess my look was funny.

Well the woman, we are going to call her dumb bitch, dumb bitch calls me from her cellphone. Our phones say the room number they're in, and I thought it was somebody calling to make a reservation but nope, it was dumb bitch calling from her cellphone, so when I asked what room she was in, she started yelling, ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ROOM I AM IN? WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?"" I didn't say sorry, I just kindly told her told that she isn't calling from her room phone, which tells me the room number so I know what room they are in, and since she called from her personal phone, there was no way of me knowing. Shhheeeee lost her shit. I thought I explained to her nicely and fairly and I refuse to say sorry for something like that. She then told me her remote in the room is not programmed to the tv, I said give me a moment, I gotta get the reprogramming instructions for the remotes, I asked her what kind of tv she has, because different tv types have different instructions. Welllll when I asked what kind of tv she had, she started yelling at me more and demanding for my supervisor. Like bitch answer the question, the tv is right in front you? I told her they weren't here and the tv type is on the tv front, she sighed and said it was a sharp television. I don't have instructions for that one, looked everywhere, I informed her I can't reprogram it and that I can give a room move with a discounted rate for the trouble. Insert her yelling at me more. I said sorry for the trouble of this, because where be my remote instructions? That's our fault,  so I say sorry and I will call maintenance man.

Wellllll she then changed gears back to the topic of me asking for her room number and yelled it shouldn't matter what her room is. I informed her that I will not help a guest unless I know the room number, because we have had incidents at the hotels around us, where people will call from the upper floors from their cellphones, say the room phone was broken and ask for towels. When that person working alone goes up ALONE, the people who called would jump them, beat the shit out of them, mug them, and then rob the hotel. So, I am not comfortable not knowing the room number and you not using the room phone, I am not comfortable with people calling from their personal phones, unless they are calling from them to inform me the room phone isn't working, that is a different story because they tend to just ask for a room move. Also, my GM said if I am not comfortable with something a guest is asking, I don't have to do it, but if it's an elderly or handicapped person, be more willing to help with the issue you're uncomfortable with. Understandable, I don't mind that at. However, this woman is more than capable of using the room phone. So, I politely asked her to please call me from her room phone if she needs anything else, because it makes me comfortable as a person working the front desk and who is completely alone, to go to a room knowing who is in there based off who called and where the caller ID is located. I treat everybody the same, I give no loop holes for this, however, I have had to deal with it like this before? People are typically understanding and say that is smart of me to do, because they know I AM ALONE

Well she just went straight into insulting me and said, ""then you need to do exactly as I say and get over this, because I don't care, I will call from whatever phone I want to, and so you better get used to this"", she said a lot. I hung up.

I texted my manager about this, give a heads up, and then she yelled at me for not doing what the guest said. And, that I have to get over not being comfortable with what she was doing. And, that it isn't an issue, and to suck it up and go help her from whatever device she is on. First off, you don't talk to me like this. Nobody talks to me like this. I am not going to have two people in 20 minutes talk to me like this. GM has been notified, screen shots taken, I am not doing this shit.

Also, I have had some very dangerous situations take place during my shifts, like I have had a lady try to attack me over my counter, while her friend was shooting up in my rest room, yet I am breaking the works policy, which I never mentioned to dumb bitch, for not doing whatever a guest says even though I cannot see their room number on my work phone, and asking for additional information if they do this to prove they are in that room, is going against your policy? Is your policy based off stupidity and making sure you employees, WHO WORK ALONE, are not safe while they are at work? Is this what you have come to? How low do you have to stoop as a person  to endanger and risk endangering your staff for a quick buck?  You'd let that woman treat me like shit and open up a chance of somebody mugging me and beating the shit out of me in your hotel hallway?

I will like to make a note, I did call my maintenance man and informed him whats up with the tv, he told me how to fix it. I called the room of dumb bitch three times and she didn't answer. It rang and all.  So, I guess I am not fixing the tv. After all of this, I cleaned Nates tank, like I scrubbed it. He very clean now.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Just got off the phone and my GM completely agreed with me, and if they are calling from their personal phones, ask extra information to make sure they really are in the hotel, because our safety is important and that lady decided to be unreasonable, didn't mention about the other manager, but she agreed with me and said to continue what I am doing, but if that woman doesn't give the room number, that's her own fault and not ours, so she needs to expect us to ask the room number and whatever else to prove it's her, and if she doesn't like it, there is a perfectly fine phone in the room that will tell us the room number. And, if she is worried about COVID-19, we will come into the room and bleach the phone or whatever to make her comfortable, but she needs to expect us to ask the room number no matter what.

"So we've had this homeless couple who has been staying with us on and off for a few months now. They've butted heads with and annoyed my coworkers, but I don't recall ever having any issues with them myself.

Tonight they come down to the desk in a tizzy. The male half of the couple asks if we have assigned parking. I say generally no, but there is a company who has been staying with us for a year and a half now who we have allowed to reserve themselves a couple spaces with cones. (Considering this company has spent over $150k with us, yeah they get some perks other people don't. These spots are the best for them since they are one of the only places you can put a truck and trailer without blocking parking lot traffic.) Besides, we're dead and there was plenty of parking nearby.

Well, they're angry because when they came in tonight, there was a cone apparently partially in one of the parking spaces, but not set up in a way that it looked like it was meant to reserve the space. So they parked there, and moved the cone the rest of the way out of the space. Later when they came back to the car that cone along with two others had been lined up behind it.

But that's not the only reason they were mad. Apparently last night someone siphoned gas from their car. They even told me where they were parked when it happened.

So I blah blahed out some apologies and said I'd talk to the owner about the contractor's behavior with the cones, while having admittedly no intention of actually doing so. But in case you missed it, there's a pandemic and hotels are real slow right now. So I'm bored. 

I decide to review the security footage to see if I can figure out if maybe another guest had siphoned their gas or what. We have a pretty dope camera set up, with [big monitors](https://imgur.com/a/csN11BU) at the desk so everyone and their mother knows it. I took that picture from our night window where the conversation occured. Not to mention these people have been in our lobby so they've had an even better view of the monitors than this.

I find their car on the camera last night. They parked and went to their room around 11:30 then... nothing. No one even parked near them, let alone siphoned their gas. No one came within two parking spaces of their car until they got into it at 8:15 this morning.

I wrote it off. Maybe they just got confused about how much gas they had left. It happens.

Well, then I went to see which of the contractors had put the cones behind their car. It was the supervisor of the group. I scroll back a bit further. Oops, went too far all the way back to the early evening when there were three evenly spaced cones blocking three parking spaces. Look at that. Mayhaps someone moved one, and there lay the confusion? Scrub forward, no one touches these nice evenly spaced cones until... Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pants On Fire arrive. They pull up, he gets out, moves the cone, and pulls into the space. Exactly what he said he didn't do.

Like most people, I really detest being lied to. Even more so, treated like an idiot. Like I wouldn't look at the security footage, which I now really wish I'd done while they were standing there to hear them try to explain themselves.

So I call up the owner. Tell him what's happened. He is filled with equally righteous rage, and we agree that this is their last night here. He wants to go pound on their door tomorrow, but I remind him they have an aggressive pit bull ""service animal.""

After that I share the good news in the FD group chat, and there was much rejoicing that we will be rid of these idiots.

So these idiots have to find a new hotel that will put up with their bullshit, all because they got butthurt and lied about a fight they started and couldn't finish. I said to my boss it's like a kid on the playground hitting another kid, then running and crying to a teacher when they got hit back.

"So, I have been on here for some 3 years, I think?  It is time to come clean about some of the practices I saw, but was too afraid to stand up against. I am no longer afraid.  I am done by being mistreated by my GM, being manipulated by him and his family. Nestle up folks...this is the Tale that Should Not Be.


So I was with my hotel for years. Was supposedly the FDM, until GM and His Wife (HW) decided that they wanted to change tactics.   Some of his GMs family and friends were my childhood friends. No problem. 

1.About 2 years ago, GM asked me to move to the property so that there would be an onsite manager while he went home for 3 months. Although this caused problems in my marriage and with my family, we did. Out of duty..be there a short while,  then GTFO while saving money. On the contrary...he came back and literally demanded the rent come out of my paycheck. Like..Do Not Clock in For 40 hours every 2 weeks. So half of my pay, those taxes are gone and overtime is impossible.  When you have 2 children, and are threatened with homelessness, you agree to more than you would think.  ( please hold your judgement, it was a suite, the girls were not at school yet,  and I was fucking stupid)  We finally got out, and I was just now making regular hours, than he cut my hours,  and tried to charge me for ""damage"" when he gave me an already out of order room.. a room that the pit bull from a previous guest, did minor damage to the carpet. He back off finally when I showed him pictures dated to before me moved in. Yes..it continues. He does this not clocking in thing for a while .

He decided to manually clock me out for 25 hours the week AFTER I moved out. He still owes me 12 1/2 hours,  for 2 months.


2.During slow times,  he will not impute cash payments into the system. He wanted us to write down all cash transactions, fill/print out the reg card, then delete the registration and place the room OofO, but of course, take payment? This was a quarantine thing, so new, and we just wanted to keep our jobs so we went with it. 


3. Ordered into quarantine with a respiratory virus, but still interacted with guests and employees.  Never told anyone he was possibly sick.  I only know this because he does not properly shred documents. A Anon Housekeeper offered his discharge form. I don't feel comfortable using it, but he wouldn't.


4. The first few days of April, my sister stayed with me due to a domestic situation. 2 days later, she was taken by ambulance but discharged without being tested but with quarantine orders as she was not in the technical ""at risk group""  (we both have autoimmune disorders, but emergency staff was justified in focusing on who they did. The testing simply was at a very limited capacity. Thank you for saving those tests for who need it more!.)  Even though I had my nephew, she was unable to contact me for 3 days (phone screen broke). I asked to he furloughed for quarantine due to exposure. He said I would ""have to reapply "". When I asked him if that meant he was laying me off, he agreed. Yesterday he asked for a resignation letter emailed bc I filed unemployment. Now, he is telling all of the regulars and my team he ""Fired Me"" and I will not be coming back.



5. He would try to charge ""fees"". Bucket check, get one thing wrong, that is $10? Use the internet for anything he deems is not ""research for guests ""? Another $10 bill. I have had 3 drops handled by at least 3 people (it is a spin safe, you have to get it perfect. This night my drop fell beside the safe bc it was spinned out)



I am sick. In body, mind and soul. I only wanted to quarantine.  I didn't even asked to be paid through,  but he literally laid me off because of it, wants a resignation letter so that I cannot receive unemployment, and is telling guests I was fired. I gave this place everything, I tried to save my guests from their negligence at the costs of my safety, sanity and physical health. I am pretty scared to death and am making a spreadsheet for back taxes to pay the last few as I thought he was still taking taxes out. I know now he wasn't. I have to dissociate from large portions of all of this,  just so that I don't get introuble for his actions while trying to figure to out how to best report these activities, and do what I can to make amends for the part I played.

I never willingly or knowingly defrauded any guest, employment or government agency. I was stupid and did what I was told. Answers got vague and requests to a person who was and still is trusted were and are still being carried through.  Only when I actually tried to file my own taxes this year and I saw my unemployment rate do I get the realization of how grievous what I am seeing now as crimes, was. I am basically looking at a 16 months of back taxes..that should have been taken out. My unemployment, which now, I will have to fight for, is only at $104 a week..that was working full time and on call for 5 years, and I worked full time. I was under the impression I was being laid off. He wants a resignation letter.  He is telling ebrrytine he fired.me becuase I had to go into quarantine, with his knowledge,  consent, ect.

Tonight, gentle readers, your humble narrator is tearing his hair out in frustration at people in these trying times.

# 

It's not as bad as \(last night\)([[https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/g1q8mx/nice\_night\_out\_gentlemen/]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/g1q8mx/nice_night_out_gentlemen/)), but I am about ready to go nanners over here. I'm sorry this isn't a happy story and is more of a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

The unicorn petting zoo is over there if you need it. Her name is Buttercup and she likes apples.

&amp;#x200B;

So we've been struggling, but we're staying afloat. This has been accomplished through dropping our regular rates to half, as well as housing some homeless people as part of the county's Shelter In Place program. The problem is that this is REALLY bringing down the quality of our clientele.

&amp;#x200B;

LOTS of 'local' guests, with all that implies. I have been catching whiffs of tobacco, pot, and other substances in our hallways all week. Pretty certain the girl in 213 was turning tricks. There's no polite way to put it, our hotel is getting filled with \*riff-raff\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the shelter folks are okay. Older, at-risk folks who aren't a problem. They've got some issues, but accept that this is for their benefit and are grateful for it. Some... should probably be in a manged care facility that can provide more help than we can (the guy in 101 \*isn't housebroken\*). But we're what they've got.

&amp;#x200B;

But they're not the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

No, the problem ones are the ones who aren't taking the situation seriously. Who are completely missing the \*point\* of being given a place to shelter. Who are blithely ignoring the idea of isolation. They're basically saying 'hey, free hotel room, let's hang out and have a party'.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

So it was that I noticed someone in the hallway, occasionally knocking on one of the doors. I go up, ask if he's a guest here. No, he's just here to see his friend. Does this friend have a name? Joe? No last name? Okay, well since he's not answering, let's go to the lobby so we can see if you have the right room number...

&amp;#x200B;

It was pretty obvious he wasn't there for a 1am bible reading, so I very pointedly told him he needed to leave. We have a lot of at-risk folks, this is \*not\* a time for \*socializing\*. He shuffled off into the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Not ten minutes later, I have the exact same thing happen with \*another\* goober. Not a guest? Off with you. No, you can't stay in the lobby for your friend who's not answering his phone or the door. \*We have a &amp;$@#ing pandemic going around\*. Go. Away.

&amp;#x200B;

Huff.

&amp;#x200B;

Would that would be the last of it.

&amp;#x200B;

But no, the hotel gods have apparently tried to flush the washcloths tonight. Right after audit, a woman comes in. She's JUST made a reservation. Oh good gravy, not... yep, she's the dreaded 'post-midnight reservation that expects to check in now'. \*Lovely\*. Local address, too - if you went on the roof you could probably see it with some decent binoculars.

&amp;#x200B;

I manage to convey that she can check in now, but unless she's checking out at noo- ah, nope, she wants it for Thursday night as well. Fine, explain that she'll need to pay for tonight. Not happy about it, but she agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, but she wants to pay cash! Argh. Yes, we'll need a credit card for the full amount of the stay. Okay, this is not your card. Your friend's card, you say? Oh, he's just in the car. I'll need him to come in with his ID. Oh but he doesn't \*have\* ID because reasons. So he's driving without a license?

&amp;#x200B;

She makes a great show of rummaging through her purse for a valid card. No, we don't take prepaid cards. Yes I'm sure. Finally, frustrated that she cannot use a card that isn't hers, she huffs off into the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Not ten minutes later, the same damn thing happens.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy and his girlfriend also have a reservation for Thursday, made after midnight, asserting that it IS Thursday and they should get to check in now. Manage to get through to him that no, it doesn't work like that, he needs a reservation for tonight. Much grumbling, but he agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course his card declines.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out to be one of those prepaid ones that is personalized. Basically a debit card without a bank and with high fees. He tries to load more money onto it, but apparently he's got a negative balance and it won't take any more unless it's a verfied source. I know this because he had it on speaker the entire damn time.

&amp;#x200B;

So they go off to try and 'fix' the card and find a place to eat. Good luck with either of those at three am during a pandemic lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes back about twenty minutes later, wanting to know what room he's in... I think he may have dumped her, assuming their relationship wasn't transactional to begin with. Someone else came and gave her a ride, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, that's the griping for tonight. One more minute then you need to say bye to Buttercup. I really hope everyone else is staying safe.

"Like a lot of places we are suffering a large downturn of business. Luckily, (Maybe?) I am apparently fairly essential as the only full time night auditor. Last night, after telling a noisy guest room to turn down the TV, I wander off to housekeeping for...yes, toilet tissue!

Nay, not for me to sneak into my car, either, you dishonest fellow wage slaves.  For the lobby restroom.  I mean, I have been all over the lobby doing little stuff to seem busy, even though there isn't anything of import to actually do. I have done the bucket check of ... 10 rooms.  I made one reg card for the single arrival already, but the boss is here playing XBOX in the office so I gotta be a little bit busy.

So arriving at housekeeping, I see a notice that there are no housekeeping staff now, other than the housekeeping manager. I guess she's cleaning all the rooms right now.

That makes me the only hourly employee left,  yay. I don't know who the relief auditor is, but they aren't ""official"" for sure, since they aren't in our time system at all.

So now I have three managers, one housekeeping department head, no maintenance and no one working in the restaurant.

Sigh.

And I see that they are working on getting aid money for payroll, which means I won't get laid off.

Yay.

Frankly, I'd rather be getting double my wages in unemployment.

I might lose my mind if the owner starts telling me how to clean the grout in the bathroom again. I've been keeping count and its hovering at half a dozen.  He never actually gets me the ""acid"" that he says I need though, lol.

"I shared this story originally on an Ask Reddit thread several months ago and thought you all might enjoy it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a nice hotel in a poor, rural community. We're a great sit up about 40 minutes out from a major city so, a good location for business. Now here's the problem. After the locals get their tax returns, they want to blow that money at my hotel, we don't let locals in here for a reason.

We call them the Smiths.

They are a family with numerous aliases, a family of obese scam artists who are on the aid system and scam churches under different names to get into the hotel for a couple of days. Get out of the ramshackle house they live in on someone else's dime. When they jump in the pool, the dirt comes off them immediately, leaving a brown, muggy mess behind. We then have to shock clean the pool. They take all of the food from breakfast and take it up to their rooms. They don't eat it; they just don't want anyone else to have it.

They also shit in the beds. 

And the middle of the floor. 

And in the pool.

We had been pretty good about keeping them out and an up to date list of their aliases for over a year. Until we got a call from a local pastor, when we refused to rent for his charity case, having an inkling as to who he wanted charity for. The woman who answered was called unchristian and we decided to say 'Fuck it' and let them in so we could see the pastor in person so we could tell him what he was dealing with.

We did not have to look for him, he came in while we were helping with laundry and closed the door behind him for privacy. He was a young man, mid-twenties, Baptist preacher, baby-faced, optimistic about the good in all people through the love of Christ. 

There was an exchange of malevolent grins between myself and my coworkers; my elderly supervisor was about to break him in ways he would not be able to describe. She was clearly relishing the opportunity.

There was such a sudden chorus of horrible things the Smith family had done at our establishment after he asked his question, what their modus operandi was for our hotel over the literal years they had been pulling this scam while me and the laundress nodded and said ""It's true, it's all true!"" like a eerie chant to my supervisor's descriptions. I then got to watch this poor man lose all color and slump down to the floor with his head in his hands whispering, ""My God, I-I need to sit down...""

“No you don’t,” My supervisor snarked.

He took a few minutes to collect himself before asking for a copy of the list of aliases we had kept in the back office, still looking pale and shook. It was like we had just taken his faith in humanity and shoved it into a blender. The Smith family was out of the hotel within twelve hours, only managing to stay one night.

The pastor personally checked their rooms.Church Scammers",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Well that was fun.

Gentle readers, I have oft spoken of a certain small percentage of my job. Excuse me a moment while the adrenaline wears off.

So... Times being what they are, things are getting a little... *rough* at the ol' Lacking Tea. 

Our prices are less than half what they should be, our occupancy less than a quarter, and those that are here are either 'locals' or here as part of an emergency housing project. There's a few construction and tree-trimming guys staying, and we're thankful for their business. 

The shift in clientele has had a nasty ripple effect. We're seeing a lot more troublesome activity in the area. I'm having to roust more people out of the lobby, and it's generally gone very sketchy very fast.

The night started well enough. Still no tacos, but one does what one must in these trying times. One of the emergency shelter folks was smoking, had to tell them to knock it off. Someone loitering on a bike in our parking lot suspiciously, told them to take a hike. All in all a night in the 'Nine Percent: Annoying Problems Skwrl Has To Deal With' category.

So, went through the audit. New procedures for recording the emergency shelter folks, but very routine. File it, hit the little skwrl's room, check to see if we need anything for tomorrow, then relax for the rest of...

... that truck wasn't there before. Is that the tree guys getting an early start at two am? They're moving a lot of equipme- *oh*. &amp;$#@. 

Angry Skwrl Mode.

I pop out the side door. Sure enough, there's two guys in ski masks busily unloading the contents of one of the work trucks, broken glass on the ground. Time to share some of the adrenaline. I bellow forth a loud ""HEY!!"" 

I haven't seen anyone panic like that in a while.

They scamper like roaches, throwing the tool boxes into their vehicle and diving incwhile I'm getting my phone out. Yay for quick camera controls (press power button twice on this model). ""SMILE FOR THE CAMERA  BASTARDS!"" - which would have been better if they weren't peeling out of the lot.

Sadly, of the four photos of their truck, only one was decently in focus... with the license plate obscured *perfectly*. Argh.

So... Called the cops, gave descriptions, they sent someone quickly. Gave statement, contacted the truck owner. Not happy, obviously, but he thanked me for my help.

And so here I sit, catching my breath. I realized that the guy I rousted from our parking lot was probably casing the truck, especially since he was right near it at the time.

Anyways, that's my night. I need a drink.

"Hello everyone! Well that was an emotional day yesterday. Thank you all for the positive comments. I swear I must've thought about every tear jerking moment of my career, but hey, that is why we do what we do right?? I had replied to someones comment yesterday saying I wanted to post a ""Twofer Tuesday"", one short sad story and a short funny story, but I once I thought about them, felt Mrs. and Mrs. Green deserved their own story. Today, Im gonna switch gears a bit.

What I am about to share with you will leave you asking a ton of questions but unfortunately I have no answers for any of them. Shoot, I'ts been 13 years and I still wonder what really happened that night. 

The Vacation Inn was a pretty large hotel and stayed busy every single day.  It was extremely rare if we had less that 70 or 80 arrivals, so there was always two or three of us working the desk. Downtime was always a blast. We would have competitions to see who could make the longest highlighter sword before it gave out. We would have drink coupon stamping races or stapler shoot outs. I know it sounds like we were terrible employees, but I guarantee you we were always on our A game. Because we loved what we did and we had fun, our service scores were always high despite the hotel falling apart, or glops of moldy drywall falling on people in the shower (story coming soon). Chief was always super cool with us messing around as long as we got our work done, and he also gave us the option of leaving whenever it was slow. This night was unusually slow, so my friend T-Rick decided to dip out for the night. I was by myself at the desk, with only Penguin the bellman walking around the lobby cleaning the tables for the 8th time. Freddy's was poppin off, The Squid was doing his thing at Tequila. He comes up to me and asks if I wanted to go have a smoke and I didn't have much else to do, so I join him. We finish our cigarette and as I'm walking in the lobby, I see the Penguin talking to a young girl, must've been a day over 20 years old. Even from afar, she looked shaken up about something. I walk behind the front desk and Penguin walks up to me and says ""hey, this girl is saying some really weird shit"" Loooooong sigh.... One of two things is about to happen. I'm gonna talk to her and dismiss her, or my night is about to descend into madness. Well, I'm writing and you're reading, so... 

I walk all the way back around the front desk to the lobby and ask her what the problem is to see how I can help. ""Hi, what can I help you with?"" ""They took my fiance.."" I ask what she meant and she repeats herself with no other details. I ask her who took her fiance and she says ""I don't know, they just came in, knocked on the door and took him"" I ask what room and she says its on the second floor, but cant remember the room number. Great, another tweaked out party girl that got locked out of her room. I ask her if she wanted me to call the cops and she says she cant call the cops. Now i'm thinking something is really wrong. As I'm scratching my head wondering what to do, she points out the sliding doors and says ""them, they're the ones that took him!"". I look out the door and see one, two, three black SUV's going up the parking lot pretty fast, lights off, one marked PD unit, fourth SUV. What is going on?? I tell Penguin to watch over the desk for a bit and I walk out the front doors. Two of the SUV's and the PD unit had blocked off the driveway to go around the hotel and two of the SUV's were stopped with the doors open by one of the middle entrances to that wing of the hotel. There were two guys outside, full blown black Call of Duty gear. Balaclava's, AR-15's (Or M-16's),  bullet proof vests, thigh holsters, etc. Oh fuck. I speed walked to the desk and told the Penguin to call PD right away. Now, if you all remember the ballad of Mr. Smith, PD and county sheriffs were regulars here, so it was typical for them to tell us about any operation going on at the hotel. This was not the case. The girl is still in the lobby and now she looks terrified. I ask again what room and she says 212 or 214, which is around the area these guys would've walked in through and gone up the stairs. I take a different route to that area of the hotel cause I need to find out what is going on, but I also don't want to end up on the back of a milk carton if I surprise these guys. I walk up and down the hallway, not a soul in sight, not a peep. I walk back down to the lobby and walk out the front door, and I see the guys outside the SUV's standing in front and behind the SUV's in a defense position, firearms up, two guys in same COD gear walking out with this dude. They're walking him out in a high stress position, arms lifted behind his back, head pushed down, covered with a jacket. I walk back inside and ask Penguin about the status of PD and he says they're on their way. By the time he tells me and I walk back outside, SUV's are gone. I notice the marked PD unit was still there, facing the way they came in, inside light is on. I start walking towards the car and wave, trying to get his attention I could tell he has something on his head. He looks up and sees me, pulls down a balaclava, turns off the inside light and drives away.  Now I need to go talk to this girl to see what happened. I walk back into the lobby and shes gone. I ask the Penguin where she went and he tells me she ran down the stairs towards Freddy's. I walk down to Freddy's and ask the doorman to see if he had seen her walk in and he says ""No man, she ran out the door."". What in the ever loving fuck just happened??? So now I'm completely confused about the events that just transpired, and no one to help me find out what just happened. I mean, no one asked for his room number, there was no warrant, were these guys cartel operatives? Was this FBI, Homeland Security? US Marshalls? Was he a fugitive? Are we in danger? What happened to the girl? How did they get in the building without a key? Am I on candid camera? Someone tell me!!!!

PD never showed that night. A few days later, one of the regular PD Officers that would stop by periodically to check on us dropped in. I tell him about what happened and very unconvincingly, he says he had no idea what I was talking about. On one hand, I am glad nothing happened and I didnt have to scoop up entrails off the walls. On the other hand, the mystery of what happened that day will always be an open door in my mind. 

I'll be off for the next two days, so have a great weekend everyone. All my current GSA's, stay safe and make someones stay memorable!!""Vacation"" Inn Stories: 1,000 questions, 0 answers",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I know everyone is having a tough time with all this COVID stuff going on and I absolutely know I dont have the biggest fish in the pan to fry... but I am honestly at my limit y'all! 

My company expects us to keep a campground running, with summer prep and hourly sanitation on facilities, with two people. Two. 2. They think it's a reasonable expectation to have us cleaning hourly for 14hrs every day. I'm not eligible for overtime, so they're splitting hairs over whether my husband should get paid overtime for the work hes putting in because they want us to split the cleaning duties up. I'm tired of trying to explain to these people that we are extremely limited in the activites that we can do in our free time - we can't drink, we can't watch a movie the whole way through, cant go to bed early to catch up on sleep, cant sit down and game for a while, etc. So fir the first 7 hours of our day we clean in addition to our normal duties, and when it's time for us to normally go home and decompress, we lose anywhere from 10-45 min each hour after that from the sanitation. 

For the last three weeks, we've been cleaning up shit on the sides of toilets, on shower benches, condom wrappers in the shower floors, losing our sense of smell from the bleach, dealing with rude guests that won't leave us alone when we're just trying to do our jobs, and superiors that expect two people to do everything without having done any of it themselves. 

On my end, I have a tenant that does fuckall for upkeep on the home she rents from us and has issues from previous ownership that shes had NUMEROUS opportunities to tell me about for the last two years that just wont. leave. us. alone. And because she failed to tell me about things being broken, they weren't fixed. And because they weren't fixed, shes not happy with my performance and wanted to speak to my supervisors. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the logic on that one.

I had a week of calling people because we had to cancel reservations due to the virus, and it *broke. my. fucking. heart* having to do it. I know it was necessary and for the best but hearing the utter disappointment in people's voices and KNOWING there wasn't anything I could do to help them was terrible. The best part of busting my ass for this place was watching families make happy memories and have a great time together. I don't even get that now.

My bosses gave me a pay cut and the beginning on the year, when my duties have NOT decreased and did not notify me of. One of my coworkers tried to get me in trouble because I didnt follow directions she never gave me and that's obviously my fault. There is literally no incentive to continue to bust our asses and give up our personal time to people who don't fucking care.

I know everything will get better eventually. I hope its soon. But god damn, I just want a day where I can have two hours to have an uninterrupted shit, shower, and nap.Tales From The Campground, Virus Edition Pt. 2",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I quit my hotel job back in the beginning of February, prior to the shutdown and shelter orders here in Oklahoma. I decided to wait to look for another job because there was going to be an event to honor my father at the school he taught biology and coached baseball since before I was born.

It was beautiful, wonderful, and unfortunately posthumous. He'd passed last year on the first of March, the first day and opening game of the school's baseball season and the dedication of the field in his name was held this year on the first day and opening game of the baseball season.

I didn't want to be in a situation where I would have to choose between working a new job and missing this event, or making this at the expense of the job. That just didn't seem fair to anyone. Then all this COVID stuff happened, and now it's even harder to get a job.

But, why did I quit, you ask? That's simple and has two parts. The manager is also the owner, but is more interested in his car dealership in another state and doesn't want to get a manager who can focus on the for the majority of the time that he's not there is the first half.

Second, for the last six months of my tenure there I'd been working the morning shift, which had been a blessing for me, since I would actually have tie together with Loquisimita and our children in the evening, or for times when my wife was performing in the theater, I could look after the kids while she was out. Morning shifts also made it easier for me to take care of the hotel's AR billings, where previously, I had two hours to get all the invoices organized and sent out before businesses closed for the day, and probably not get called back until the morning shift of the next day. Why do I go into this detail? The boss decided that he wanted me back on Evenings.

That's just not compatible with my family any more. We'd already adjusted to this. My father had helped with the kids when Loquisimita and I were both occupied in the evenings, and there's not really anyone else here to help with them. I'd told this to the boss and his response really disappointed me. He just didn't want me on mornings, but he was saying he needed me before checkouts to solve problems before they were harder to fix. He was willing to offer me Nights instead, for the differential, which was not an option, as my three years in warehouse distribution center loading dock and several years in hotels prior has, in my opinion, ruined my kids' sleep schedules because they want to be up when daddy gets home.

I had three days left in my schedule for the week when he told me that day that the inspector said I wasn't keeping up the breakfast enough. I apologized to the inspector for the breakfast the following morning and he said it wasn't my fault, he saw I was all over the place handling checkouts, putting salt on the sidewalks, and working on te food. But he did wonder where the Breakfast Attendant was. We didn't have one.

So, the inspector told me to my face I'm doing a good job, but my boss isn't happy with how it's going suddenly? Things kinda turned around on me here. This is when I knew I would be quitting.

I told my wife and she was upset. I think I'm gonna stay out of hotels for a while. I can handle irate or troublesome customers all day long, I can deal with catty and snide co-workers, but when your superior(s) don't have your back, it's time to get out.I've been holding off on this.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello everyone! First off, I have to say I am blown away by the positive reactions. I am glad to see you all are enjoying these as much as I am enjoying writing them. Thanks for the kinds words!! 

Now, anyone that has been in Hospitality for a long time knows that we see all and hear all. Our stories or experiences range from unbelievably funny, to WTF, to blind raging, to soul crushingly heartbreaking that you try not to share those. We see humanity at its finest, and sometimes at its most desperate. I am going to share a tale with you today, one that still gives me a lump in my throat after 15 years, but makes me smile knowing that I made someone happy.

I had really started enjoying my job as a GSA. As much as I despised grown men throwing fits because we forgot to leave them an extra pack of coffee or a towel, things for the most part were pretty good at the Vacation Inn. Met a ton of interesting people, learned valuable communication skills, and had great, albeit crazy, coworkers. A quick preface to this story, our hotel was huge on ""experiences"". In the evenings, we did Margarita making classes, Salsa making classes, traditional Mexican aguas frescas (fresh fruit waters) classes during the week. It was about an hour into my shift when a couple walks in through the sliding double doors. A couple in their late 40's, early 50's. I could tell that they had been driving for a while by the stretch walk we all do after an 8 hour car ride. I greet them with the typical ""Good afternoon! welcome to the Vacation Inn!"" Right off the bat, something felt off. Mr. and Mrs. Green were smiling, but it was a forced smile. I didn't give it much thought at first since I saw this often, maybe an argument on the ride here, but I'll do my best to make their stay memorable. We get to the usual small talk, where they were coming from, weather, etc. They were from the Midwest, high school sweethearts, married for 20 years traveling on a cross country sight seeing tour. ""That's super cool! So why this city?"" She said she always was fascinated with southwest culture, decor, and always wanted to see the desert. ""Awesome! where are you going next?"" I remember saying something to that effect out loud and through a brave smile Mrs. Green's eyes got a little misty. The feeling of something being off hit me like a semi truck. Mrs. Green was wearing a wig and was way too thin for her age. Even writing this makes my heart sink. ""Well, if I make it, I've always wanted to see a California beach. I have terminal cancer, so I don't know how long I'll last"". Mr Green gives her a hug and says something like ""I'ts ok honey, were gonna see that beach"". Fuck. My. Life. I had never dealt with this. What do you say? I'm sure she had heard a non sympathetic ""Oh, Im sorry to hear that"" everywhere she went. I'm a 21 year old at the front desk trying to hold back tears as shes telling me this.  I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something like ""who needs California!? They're all snooty anyway. I promise you you'll fall in love with our city and wont want to leave"". They both laugh and say thank you and make their way up to their room.

I walk to the back office to try and compose myself. Chief asks whats wrong so I tell him about Mr. and Mrs Green. He says, ""Chief, this is your time to shine! make this a memorable stay for them!!"" Lightbulb!!  I reach out to our Sales team and ask if there is any way we could do a special ""Experience"" class for a guest and Sales asks why since we only do them on specific days. As soon as I tell them about the Green's, she starts bawling. She starts preparing everything for them, Salsa making, margarita making, get her a little ornament piñata, iconic pics of our city, etc. I do my follow up call with the Greens and ask how they found the room, yada yada. I tell them whenever they are ready, to come down to the lobby because I forgot to give them a welcome gift. Mrs. Green was going to take a nap since she wasn't feeling well so they came down about 3 hrs later, around 4 or 5ish. Mr. Green says they really didn't need the gift as they were only staying one night and I tell them no, I insist. Chief and I walk them over to the lobby where the tables were all set up for them and my Sales Manager says Mr. and Mrs. Green! Welcome! Have you ever made a traditional Margarita?"" Mrs. Green was obviously confused, but went along with it. The Squid put on his best most professional face and showed them both how to make the perfect margarita. I mean, he put on a show, with the bartender flair, throwing up the metal mixing cup, spinning the bottle in true showman fashion. Lencho, the degenerate Chef showed them how to roast the jalapeños, tomatoes, tomatillos and onions to make a traditional salsa. They even brought out the traditional 'molcajete'. Taught them how to make guacamole, I mean, they did the works. She was wearing a Mariachi sombrero, took pictures holding the Lobby singers guitar. Every event made Mrs. Green's eyes glow brighter and smile bigger. Towards the end of the night, the regulars at Tequila basically took them in as one of their own and the Green's were elated, just blown away. I'd like to think that for a minute or two, the Green's felt this was the best part of their trip. 

The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Green extended their stay for 2 nights. They were so blown away by the hospitality that we showed them that they stayed and checked out all of or sights, took pictures, and ate the best Mexican food of their lives. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to say goodbye to them since I was off for the next 2 days. Of course I asked my coworkers about them and they said they really didn't see them since they had been out and about, but they would stop by the desk and ask for mapquest printouts. (Yes, I'm that old) A few months later, we received a postcard from California. Mr. and Mrs. Green had made it to the California beach. They thanked the whole team for such a wonderful stay and a wonderful memory. They did say Californians were snooty lol. I wish I had kept that postcard. I don't know how long Mr. Green was able to hold on to Mrs. Green, but anytime I think of that story, I like to imagine she got better and she was able to see all the sights she wanted to see and she was able to show off her killer margarita skills. One thing for sure, anytime I see a bartender shaking up a margarita I think of her. 

Now I am at the front desk trying to finish my profit and loss report with watery yes. I hope this didn't ruin anyone's day. I though to myself that as crazy as some days are, we have to remember those days  we made someone smile in their darkest moments.

"tl;dr Karen has to wait to check in, goes to her room, comes back down to complain more, goes to our favorite travel advisory review site and corporate about me being terrible (wildly false).

Let me paint you a picture, it's 845p on Christmas Eve 2012 at SeaTac, WA (Seattle's airport town) and shockingly enough, everyone wants the day off to spend with their family. We're a union shop whose schedule is based on seniority. I am the junior night auditor at the time so I drew the short straw and get to work over the holiday. 144 room hotel, 2 front desk agents max at the desk. We're short-staffed (shocking) so I get called to come and work 800p-600a to help the single FDA with the night time rush. FDA leaves around 830p so I am solo from now until 500a. 845p rolls around and I see our airport shuttle roll in, then a passenger car right behind it. Check-ins disembark from shuttle, its an old couple  who need to pick their car up but there is some issue that I can't remember, something about their trip going over the amount of days they pre-paid and needing to pay the difference, confusion who gets paid, etc. They aren't the problem here. Their issue is sorted in about 15  minutes and up to the desk walks up the most Karen of Karens ever to Karen.

Karen immediately goes on the offensive with ""\*clears throat\* I need to speak to your manager *now.*  The customer service here is terrible"". Keep in mind all that she has done is wait in line behind the elderly couple as I helped them. She then goes on and on about how rude it is to have made her wait for so long, how rude it is for us to check people in so slowly on Christmas Eve, etc. All without letting me get a word in edgewise. All during this I'm trying to check her in as quickly and thoroughly as I can to never see her again. It sounds like she's gotten her say and she goes to her  room.

About 20 minutes later I'm  at the desk doing Audit reports and who do I see walking back to the  desk? Motherfucking K a r e n. She comes back to the desk and starts laying into me again about how rude I am to have made her wait. She has the fucking gall to say that we should have more staff here for when its busy. I apologize, do the song and dance and she goes back to her room  for the night.

2 days later I check our travel advisory site and she writes a 2\* review about our hotel. I find out she also contacted the GM who has to contact Corporate about it. I get talked to about the situation but no punishment gets handed down because I'm not the type to be rude to clients and my GM went to bat for me.

I know I need to let it go but getting pen to paper helps. Thanks for watching my TED Talk. Her review is posted below,

""Terrible service.

Took over 15 minutes to check in, one person on duty. Checked in at 9pm on Christmas Eve. Park and fly does not work smoothly, highly recommend another hotel. Parking not as promised. Hotel also very old.""Almost 8 years later and I'm still salty about this guest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Been at this hotel ~5 years. Tonight, for the first time ever, i had to console and deal with a woman who earlier today suffered from domestic assault. She didn't have money for a room, so I found a number for the help line where she talked to them and we had to phone other numbers for shelters. Finally, we got to the sixth, and last, number. Fortunately, there was availability, so she got transported their for the night. When she was done talking on the phone, i made sure to tell her that by leaving, she did something super difficult, but also courageous and that i was proud of her for it. How does one approach a situation like this? Does any other FD person here have any experience with this sort of matter? I'm just not sure if i should've done more or if i approached the situation properly, tbh I still can't believe this just happenedA First For Me",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It was a chill day at work, started out as chill at least. I was cleaning up the front desk area when an extended stay guest walked up and asked if we had cameras in our parking lot. I said we don't and asked why he is asking. He said a week ago, a loud black truck woke him up from his sleep, he looked out the window and saw the man driving the truck in the bed of his truck trying to break into his work truck, along with the toolbox that is connected to the bed of the truck. He said he ran outside and stopped him, the truck tried to run him over and drove off. What was going through my head was, ""WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS NOW?!!!""

I asked if he called the cops, he said he didn't because he didn't get a good look at the guy, only the truck type, but not the license plate, deemed it as a waste of time for the police at that point, but decided if the truck comes back, he will call them of course. I asked if he informed anybody else in my office of this. He said yes, to the night auditor, but my night auditor told him to stop drinking and go upstairs, (I did inform my GM and manager of that comment he made, was uncalled for)

I asked him if he can describe the truck to me the best he can. He described the truck and the one thing he could never forget was the LED lights and the sound of the engine. I said awesome, I will leave a note, and that my management will be informed right now, because this is important stuff, if it happened to him, who else has this happened to? 

Hours went by, I was at the back room eating candy and watching my fish Nate swim around, we just stare at each other. Does not give good conversation. ANY WHO, it was 9:45 and I was brought back to reality from my intense staring contest with Nate, when the sound of a loud as engine started rumbling through my parking lot. I thought I had a guest coming in, so I got up and went to my desk only to find the truck the guy described to me before, bright ass LED lights and loud ass engine, was at his work truck again, parked RIGHT up against it, and the man was in the bed of his truck. Keep in mind, his work truck is parked RIGHT in front of my hotel main door, I COULD SEE HIM CLEAR AS DAY FROM MY DESK

I jumped my counter and ran outside and stood a good few feet from his truck. I didn't say anything. I just stared at him. I stared at him to the point he realized I was there, and he looked at me and then started staring at me back. I then waved at him to show him I know what he is doing and I am watching his every move. I got a very good look at him, along with his exact type of boxers, because he was sagging his pants low and his LED lights were so bright, it just lit them up. He then started to freak out and I waved again at him and said hi to him. A woman from the truck yelled, ""babe we gotta go now"", he hopped into his truck and drove off. 

I then ran back inside and informed the guest of what just happened. He ran downstairs along with his co workers, who also have trucks outside, ran outside to check their trucks. I called the police and informed them of what happened, and described the man and the truck to dispatch. The guests came back inside and I handed them the phone to talk to the police. Turns out, the dude was trying to siphon diesel fuel from their work trucks. 

After everything got chill and the worker dudes were making jokes about doing stuff with their thumb to him(horrible things about their thumbs to him), the police parked at the restaurant next door to watch and keep a look out for the siphoning truck, because most of the buildings on my work street are hotels, so the chances of him trying to hit another hotel were kinda high. I called my managers, they said leave a great in depth note of the truck and the man and inform the night auditor.

Well, the night auditor working that night was the one who called the man drunk and to go back upstairs. So, when I said, ""the man from room blah truck was broken into last week"", he cut me off and started yelling about how he was drunk and an idiot and needs to lay off the bottle. He said a lot of horrible things about this guy. So, when he stopped yelling, I said, ""well he isn't a drunk idiot, because that truck you failed to inform management about came back and tried to siphon diesel fuel out of his truck again tonight and management said to keep an eye out for that truck"", he got reeeaaaaallllllll quiet and was reeeeaaaaallllllyyyyyy mad at me.   
Any who, the truck hasn't come back yet, but I am pretty sure he will be back one day. And, when he does. I will wave and say hi again.

Though this story wasn't crazy or as exciting, it helped past the time till my shift ended. 

Also, I am not a car person, I go to my big brother and my boyfriends dad for car stuff. if anybody can tell me the reasoning as to why somebody would want to siphon diesel out of a truck, I would greatly appreciate it.If we can not siphon diesel full out of trucks, that would be great ok?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I am on mobile.  Sorry if there are any typing mistakes. 

I have been in the Hotel business for 12 years now.  I worked in small and big hotels,  cruise ships and hostels in multiple countries. 

My small charming rustic hotel that I just loved so much just closed.  I have been on leave since the 16th of March and they told us today that they will not reopen and are going bankrupt. 

So I have decided to change career, because I felt completely useless for the past month and because the tourism industry will be ruthless for the next year or so. 

I have applied for a small program in Chain supply and logistics in a university in Montreal and luckily will start next September.

"I work at a very small non-chain hotel, so this stuff never happens to me but I guess I got lucky. Our GM has a clear policy for Front Desk Agents that if something feels off, you can decide not to honor a res for any reason. 

We have a parking garage with 3 floors, the second has a security door you usually need a key to get in, but has plenty of signs to signify it's guests only. The main entrance is the first thing you see pulling in, with a plethora of spots to park and check in. 2 dudes parked up on the second floor and managed to come in that door and come downstairs and ask for a room. We have a barrier and a sign up that says you cannot come within 6 feet of the desk, and they ignored that and I had to tell them to back up. I told them our rates, and they said they would book through 3rd party. I asked if they had ID and they got angry, asking why they wouldn't. I told them I literally have to ask everyone if they have ID on them. 

At this point they start making the res and I tell them I would not honor it, based on what I've listed above here. They got angry, accused me of being racist (they were both black) and called me some fun names. They then recorded me asking me why I wouldn't honor the res, and I told them the 3 reasons. They ended up leaving after a while, but I haven't gotten to the worst part yet. 

My hotel has a restaurant that's doing room service only right now and right as these guys came down the stairs the chef brought my burger I had ordered over. After 30 minutes of dealing with this, and being a little shaky, definitely couldn't eat it :(Guest accused me of racism and ruined my dinner",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We stopped taking cash recently because of COVID-19. That means credit only. Since we're a new business client at the bank, our terminal has certain limits so we can't take debit for incidentals (temporary). I understand not everyone has a CC, but there are maybe 10 other properties in a 5 miles radius and most people, while disappointed, are understanding.

There's a semi-regular lady who used to always come in without a CC. Every single time I would warn her (she then would grumpily produce a cash deposit) and she just kept coming back and for some reason, other FDAs would always rent her a room without incidentals because she's *regular*. Annoys me to no end when it's my turn to deal with her because ""the other guy/girl did it for her"". If I'm working, she won't get a room without a deposit. Period.

Recently management put in place a ""no exception"" rules, and my FDM even emphasized ""not even for regulars"" (we've gotten screwed over by ""good regular guests"" before). Now he's on paternity leave and since we're down to a skeleton crew communication is abysmal. I come in for my second shift today to have the morning FDA tell me ""oh sorry I rerented that room you said could be CC fraud. K thanks bye."" Dude WHAT.

Even better, I saw a reservation for No CC Lady in the system with a debit on file, made by him! I promptly cancelled it and gave her a call. Which went on for 15 minutes. Highlights include: her threatening to leave bad comments, her insisting that the ""other guy"" told her it was fine so it has to be fine (to which I replied ""OK so he wasn't following policy then""), and her informing me that she was coming over right now and that she had the right to speak to a manager when she arrived. I ended the call with a cheery ""Thank you!"".

She did come over a bit later and just to humour her I called my FDM, who backed me up 100%. Another 15 minutes of her insisting that I bend the rules just for her because she's a regular (like that means shit to me), that her debit has to work fine here because it worked over the phone at some other place earlier (just... no), and the most amusing bit: she accused me of purposefully speaking english to my FDM on the phone so she wouldn't understand the conversation (bilingual province). 

""But the other guy told me my reservation was made earlier.""

""It's not a valid reservation because there's no credit card.""

""I will leave the deposit in cash.""

""COVID, absolutely no cash.""

""You think I don't know what a COVID is??! Take my cash!""

""Ma'am that doesn't even make sense.""

""You're gonna lose a good regular because of this stupid policy.""

""If you're a good customer then you would've followed our policy.""

""So what, am I supposed to sleep in my car?""

""I'm not here to make life decisions for you.""

Then as she was leaving she made a point to write down a bad ""review"" on her phone and reading it out loud?! You're not even a guest here! So I put up my ""BRB"" sign and went to take a piss. She left.

I'm tired of this. Am I fucking crazy for wanting to follow the rules? Why does no one else here do their job like they should? When will the madness end?

"Hi everyone. Ive been going a mile a minute trying to pick the best tales to tell, but whenever I think of one, my mind spiderwebs and thinks of 15 others so I settled on this one. Now this one is kind of sad, but were all grown ups here and we make our own decisions and we have to suffer the consequences. 

This happened about 6 months into my tenure at the ""Vacation"" Inn. I had picked up the tricks of the trade pretty quickly and understood the underbelly of the Hotel/Bar world. As some of you may recall, ""Freddy's"" nightclub was the place to be. In any bar/nightclub scene, there is always a criminal element present and Freddy's was no different. The Squid taught me which of the regular women had a ""dress for sale"" and if they were not regulars, he taught me how to spot them right away. He also informed me that they had a deal with Blart the bar manger. Don't ask, don't tell. I learned to spot coke dealers, coke users, pimps, madames, undercover cops, etc. just by looking at them and their body language. Prostitution was always an ongoing issue to the point where the County Sheriffs would set up sting operations about once every 3 months, both as Johns and Janes. No joke, this was the highlight of our PM shifts as shitty as it sounds. Before I go any further, this wasnt Breaking Bad, meth prostitution. We were a 4 star hotel at the time so 9 out of 10 Janes were beautiful women. I also learned that this is virtually the only difference between an escort and a prostitute lol. 

Anywho, Mr. Smith checks in by himself. Typical ""business guest"". Middle age white dude, nice suit and watch, shined shoes, etc. He hears the lobby music at ""Tequila"" and asks about the food/drink situation. I tell him hours of operation, menu, introduce him to the restaurant hostess, tell him about our 50+ tequila selection at ""Tequila"" bar, the whole 9 yards. He seems pretty unimpressed till I hit him with 'If you want to stay up late though, you can stop by 'Freddy's, they're open till 2am'. I swear, he was like a mutt that heard a slice of Kraft singles being opened. ""Freddys huh? Whats the atmosphere?"" Tell him about the salsa music, dancing, drinks, etcetera, and he says ""Salsa music? Are there any latin women to dance with?"" Plenty Mr. Smith, plenty of Señoritas to dance with. Fucking guy.. Anywho, fast forward to about 9 pm. Mr. Smith had a few glasses of wine at dinner, a few tequilas at Tequila, and now he was on his was on his way to Freddys with a little more slide in his stride, you know that very short lived window between fun and lubricated to desperate and morose. As he's walking downstairs to Freddys, The Squid stops by the desk and says ""hey man, watch out for Mr. Smith, he was a little too blunt with one of our regulars, asking if she'd go up to his room"". I mean, that's a regular occurrence so it didn't phase me too much, but if The Squid, one of the coolest and calmest people on the planet is worried, then there is cause for concern. 

So down goes Mr. Smith, to try and find himself a Latin señorita. It is roughly 10:15 pm when I see two familiar faces walking up the stairs. One of them is a very visibly drunk Mr. Smith, who had joyfully let go of the little sobriety he had, and Jane, a well known dress merchant. As Mr. Smith gets closer to the FD, he glances at me at gives me a not so subtle look of ""Fuck yeah, I got one"" and I return a grossly blatant ""Abort mission"" head shake. Well, he obviously didn't heed my warning and proceeded up to his room. Fast forward about an hour and a half. I'm chit chatting with the night auditor, telling him about the day, specifically about Mr. Smith. I would normally chill with Bobo the night auditor for about an hour and catch him up on the day, either smoke a cigarette, a joint, or both. He was the older, no nonsense older guy from the Samoan story. Guess who we see stumble through the lobby? A half dressed, messy haired Mr. Smith come up to the desk. He is fuming and says ""I need you to call the cops RIGHT NOW!"". Heyyyy, take it easy Mr. Smith, whats the matter? ""That bitch I took up to my room just took all my money while I was in the bathroom! She was a fucking hooker!! I only have her $100 and she took the rest!!"" I mean, he's not wrong, but what could I do at this point right? So i tell him ""Mr. Smith, sorry to hear that"" ""YOU WERE IN ON IT WEREN'T YOU??!!"" No sir, i am most definitely not. Bobo come up and is about to set him straight when I tell him its cool, I got this. ""Mr. Smith, think about what you are asking me to do. You want me to call the cops so you can report a prostitute taking all of your money instead of the $100 you agreed on?"" He shouts and screams that we are in on it and he wants to file a report, bla bla bla, so I comply and call PD. Of course PD shows up and at this point, PD and I are first name basis and I explain what is going on. PD looks at me dumbfounded and I say ""Yeah, I know"" So PD talks to Mr. Smith and asks the standard questions. Mr smith tells them that she had asked for $100 for her services, they made an agreement for what kind of services $100 would entail, and once services were rendered, he went to the restroom to ""wash up"" when he heard the door open and close. He walked out of the restroom to find Jane had taken over $500 from his wallet. PD gets the description and tells him ""Now sir, can you please put you hands behind your back, you are being arrested for solicitation"" A very confused Mr. Smith says, ""but why, I am the one who got robbed! You cant do this"" Once reality sets in and he realizes he fucked up, he gets taken away with no incident. 

I mean, I genuinely felt bad for the guy, but hey, we all have to suffer the consequences for our actions right? I hope you all enjoyed this one. I work desk all week and I'l try my best to post a tale. Thanks for reading!""Vacation"" Inn Stories: You cant say I didn't warn you sir...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"During this Convid-19 time, I think we all need a 'little' laugh.

First English is not my first language, so there might be some typos.

&amp;#x200B;

This happend for some years ago during the summer. Note we are largely a business and conference hotel 90% of the year. But during the summer we do a 180 and have 99% families at the hotel.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this was in the middle of the summer and the hotel a full of tourists, all nationalities, all religions etc. 

Earlier in my shift I check in a Muslim family, nothing strange here, I small talk with the father about the weather, what they can do here etc etc. He turns around and I notice his wife for the first time. She was in the full burka, and only a little slit for her to see. I don't care about religion, but it is not something we see everyday in my country. They go to the elevators and up to their room. After some time they come back down, I ask them if everything is OK with the room, and they can't put a finger on anything (BIG WIN at the time). The father ask for the shopping mall and  I give him the address, and off they go.

An hour or two goes by and I'm checking in a family from Sweden. The parents where super nice, the children (6-8 years old), well they where everywhere in the lobby. The parents told me that they have driven from a city north of Stockholm. In other words, they have been driving for +10 hours. We start to small talk, while the children choose what gift they want (we give all children a small gift, when they arrive), I see the first family come back, and where headed for the elevators. Father with the family in tow. They enter the elevator, and the mother is the last one to enter. She turns around and are 'facing' the lobby. The youngest of the Swedish children sees her just before the elevator door closes and SHOUTS ""Look daddy! It's a NINJA!"" The mother turns red in embarrassment, and calmly, but firm, tell her child that you can't say something like that.  The father also turns red, but I can see that he is about to burst out in laughter, BTW so am I. We both just smiling, and I had to bite my lip. They go to the elevator, the father and I look and each other and I make a little karate chop. He bursts out in laughter and I go into the back office and laugh for a minute or two.

I hope you all will have a little laugh or at least a good smile from this story.

"I'm still employed luckily. While I may work for wealthy people, I think it's important for people like me who still have jobs to think of our larger communities. 

We are having a hard time getting PPE here, like everywhere. I saw a resident last week wearing an airline eye-mask over their nose and mouth. My boss had the same paper mask on for a week. 

I heard about another concierge in the NE bringing in his sewing machine to make PPE at the desk so I've done the same. 

I've made about 150 masks so far for the residents, which I refused to sell. Many were gracious and gave me a tip though, which is always appreciated. The tips allowed me to buy more fabric to make masks for the community. 

Now that our building is stocked up on facemasks, we've decided to keep on making them. Today, I'll be making about 50 more for the local hospital. After they are stocked up, we'll move to making them for the homeless shelters. 

One of the residents, who is a sweetheart, bought a bunch of fabric for the project. Seems like we might actually be able to do some good here.

"Hello all, day number 2 off from work, and I figured what better way to enjoy part of the day than to give my fellow Redditors a nice Front Office tale!  There will be a TLDR at the bottom, because I need to explain the program first, and that could be a lot by itself. This story happened in January, which where I live, is a big travel time, as people migrate South to escape the cold. I am also at an airport property that offers a park and fly program. Before I was hired on for many years, they just offered this for free (bad move), but about two months before I joined the team they introduced a third party booking site. This company would then check the availability of the parking lot, monitor the cars, and take all payment. All we did was have the car left here, and shuttle people to and from the airport. Now as a result of the free program suddenly being charged, it was met with a lot of resistance as you could probably imagine, many of which were silver hairs that just couldn't understand it, and exclaimed it as bad business practice (if anything, how we did it before was worse in that sense).

If you didn't want to use the third party, you could book a parking package at the hotel which not only had the room, and then parking at a discounted nightly rate that was paid up front, but we included 7 days of free parking to go with it. It was a better deal if you were going to be gone for long periods of time, but if you were only going to be gone for a week, it normally was cheaper to book the third party. If there was no room reservation, we could not book parking by itself. I know this is a lot of info, but it is all important for what happens in this tale, and I will also try to answer any questions to the best of my ability, moving on.

It is a nice cold day here at work, and we are pretty busy as the aforementioned snow birds are desperately flocking to get inside and to the airport. I am working with my Manager and our front desk supervisor, so for this hotel (not to brag) the dream team for the desk. As we're cranking out these check ins, in walks THE FAMILY. This is a family that have three reservations that HAVE to be next to each other or the world will end, about 5 people per room, and enough luggage to fill our shuttle by itself. I want to say every person had two rolling suitcases each, and the best part as I hope I've made obvious at this point, entitled and rotten. The leader of the group stomps (yes, actually stomped) to my boss standing next to me and the following occurs.

Cast: me: Mildly entertained, B: Boss, CL: Crazy Lady, H: Crazy lady's husband (and probably the only nice one)

CL: \*last name\* checking in, and you better have us all next door to each other, as we were promised that over the phone, and God help you if we're not. (charming right?)

B: Well hello ma'am, yes I have the notes on the reservations about being next door to each other, and want you to know that we did do this, but nobody promised it as it isn't something we CAN promise due to availability, it just worked out this time. (He always likes to stir the pot, and is one of the reasons I like working with him because it is never a dull moment)

CL: \*blank stare\* Sooooo, you didn't get us next door after we specifically stated that's what we needed, and were promised by your lackeys?

B: No ma'am, that is not what I said, and do not refer to my employees as ""Lackeys"" that is insulting. I said you are next door, but wanted you to know that it isn't ever promised no matter what property you go to, because it's subject to availability.

CL: Whatever, I don't know why you're telling me this, it doesn't apply to me. Just check us in before you get on my bad side.

B: Ma'am I can tell you right now, you're already on MY bad side, and if you continue down this path, you're going to have to find a new property to stay at.

I don't know how this tactic worked but, CL stopped talking and just continued the check in process silently. We all hoped this would be it, but I wouldn't be posting this if it was. A few hours later, and everything has calmed down. We sent the supervisor home after we got some laughs in about this lady, and who the hell she thought she was. Que angry stomping coming towards the desk. We're all in the back seeing the supervisor off, but we heard her coming and were on our way up front.

CL: \*banging the counter repeatedly\* HELLO?! IS ANYBODY ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB AROUND HERE, OR ALL JUST HAVING A SNOOZE IN THE BACK?

B: Hello again ma'am, how may we be of service?

CL: Oh it's YOU, I don't want to talk to your snotty ass, give me your manager.

B: Oh sure ma'am, that would be this gentleman here \*points at me\* (we do this to each other all the time so please no comments of him being a bad manager)

CL: \*talking to me now\* You need to control your staff better (I surprised she didn't say lackey again, guess she's learning) now I need to schedule the shuttle for tomorrow for my family to get to the airport, and I didn't do it earlier for fear that your associate was going to kick me out for merely talking.

Me: Well ma'am, I can assist you with that, but are you leaving a car here by chance? If so, I need to write some info down to make sure the third party company you paid the parking fee with doesn't tow your car.

CL: What parking fee? We have stayed here for years and it's always been free, and the person on the phone said it was free too.

Me: Yes, it was free, but a few months ago corporate changed the policy, and now this is how it's done.

CL: This is ridiculous, now you guys are lying, and I wont stand for it. You are going to let me leave my car here the 17 days I was going to, or you're going to be getting a call from the BBB (Better Business Bureau) about your shady practices. How can you say one thing and do another?

Me: Ma'am, I am in no mood for this right now. This is how it is, we do not handle parking outside of a shuttle and a place to park. If you didn't contact them you will have to do that before you leave, because they will tow your car if it's not on the list. You can contact BBB all you want, but it is listed on our website, and every phone call mentioning park and fly is explained the same way.

CL: You're all just bullies, and have successfully ruined our family vacation, I hope you're happy, especially once I get a hold of them and they shut your shit hole down. I'm also going to be in contact with your manager, and your corporate so I hope you enjoy losing your job you slimeball.

With that, she stomped off to her room, and my boss and I enjoyed a nice laugh at her expense. I want to say only 10 minutes later her husband comes down. Both of us steel ourselves as we expect the worst.

H: Hey guys, first off I just want to apologize on behalf of my wife. I've gotten used to it being married to her for years, but I won't lie, she's a pretty nasty person to service industry people, and I can't figure out why. With that being said, after she explained everything to me I figured I'd come down and talk to you guys myself so, what REALLY happened because I've learned not to trust everything she says.

I explain what we said, and what she said, and he just gets this sad look on his face, I honestly felt bad for him, it was the look of a person whose spirit had been broken more than once, and was just tired.

H: Oh, I see, well I'll call the third party now, and get it taken care of. I again am sorry about her, you guys are great, and it actually made my night seeing you guys handle her. I am sorry though, she's probably going to write a bad review, and get everyone else to do the same because they always agree with her, but you guys have a lovely hotel, and I know I'll at least leave a good one.

With that, he calls the company right there in front of us, show his receipt, and we have him fill out the appropriate paperwork. Thankfully, the time they needed the shuttle didn't interfere with our flight crew times, and they had a time slot to themselves, because it took about three trips to get everyone and their luggage there. We later saw a review that stated the following,

""One star, and by far the worst Smilton we've ever been at. They should have their flag dropped, and the building demolished. Despite the actual property being filthy, the staff members have an equally disgusting attitude, and if the other properties weren't sold out (they weren't) we would have left. An absolute disgrace, and I don't think there's enough soap in the world to make me feel clean again after my stay there.""

and another review following,

""To anybody reading these reviews, please ignore the one star review by CL. She is my wife, and could not be more wrong about the property. She just was taking a bad day out on the wrong people. This property is amazing, and it seems the staff has experience dealing with people like my wife on a regular basis, and could not be more professional. To anybody coming into the area, I would recommend this property, as they will take care of any problem that may occur, and do it with a smile on their face.""

I hope you all enjoyed this, and sorry for the wall of text explaining the park &amp; fly, it causes more problems than it should, but that's how things work sometimes.

TLDR: Entitled woman thinks she can be rude as hell and bully her way into parking for free. Is even more enraged when my boss and I don't give a shit. Finally, her husband may not stick up to her face to face, but at least has out back in the reviews.

Edit: I also want to say, this is going to be my last post for about a week, I have a 7 day work week coming up, and those drain me. I'll still try to answer comments to the best of my ability, but I can't make any promises.The family.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Working the desk tonight in the US in a state that has a stay home order for anything deemed non-essential.  I took about 6 different calls asking if our pool is open....  I get that people are bored and want to get out of their house, but expecting our pool to be open and thinking you should be able to use it is sheer stupidity at the moment.  The chlorine may kill anything in the water, but cram two dozen people who are clearly not following social distancing into a small shared space and its likely all of them will get sick because one of them probably has it.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I cannot believe the amount of calls I've gotten from people who are downright giddy to tell me they expect a big discount because we are following the legal restrictions surrounding the shutdown of our usual amenities.

I had the satisfaction of getting one heavily sighing Karen to hang up on me when I explained to her that we won't open the pool area ""just for her group"" because it's not only illegal but also socially irresponsible.  

I usually end up crushing their smug attitudes with a subtle reminder that nonessential travel is currently banned but we are housing doctors and nurses that are fighting this at one of the local hospitals.  I tell them we're still offering rates for our negotiated business partners doing essential business and ask them what is bringing them into town on their essential business.

9 out of 10 people that start their call off bragging about how much of a discount they'll be getting usually get quiet and stammer on about ""an appointment"" they have and get off the phone pretty quick.  I never mention the highly discounted rate we have and quote them our rack rate.

For the people that don't start their calls off like an entitled jackass, I get some info on why they're coming in. If they're driving a truck with med supplies or a nurse or doctor coming in, or if they're fighting this thing in any way, they get the big discount and free upgrades to private balcony suites because they deserve it.  I put them in the best rooms at a quarter of the usual cost.  Other folks traveling for other reasons get the discount too, if they have a valid reason to stay with us.  I usually try to get them setup with some local places doing food delivery.

If you're going to act like an entitled ass though, don't call my property.  Stay home, even though everyone in your house probably resents you because you have the audacity to be an entitled prick in the midst of a global pandemic.  We don't need you getting the heroes of this tragedy sick with cross contamination because you can't imagine sitting on your couch for another month.Entitlement, even in the midst of a pandemic....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello everyone! I hope you enjoyed my story about the Samoan yesterday. In the midst of people being entitled jerks and acting like fools during the worst economic crisis the industry has ever faced, I figured Id make a few of you all laugh and say ""WTF"" during my Golden Age of hospitality. 

Before I go on posting my tales, as tall as they may seem, I want to introduce you to a colorful cast of characters that If i didn't interact with them myself, I wouldn't believe they existed in the first place. Ill be posting right after this, I just wanted to introduce you to the team. There are a lot more people I worked with, these are just the main protagonists/antagonists. First off, you have the General Manager, **Mr. Moffet**. He was an old school Ultra Conservative Texan, typical Good ol' boy. Short, rotund, wore cowboy boots with suits and talked with the classic Texas drawl. Really only cared about people in his position or higher. He would walk in his office at 9, wouldnt come out till lunch, go back in his office, come out at 5 only to go have dinner with his friends at the lobby restaurant. **Mickey**, the Food and Beverage Director. She had been there for about 15 years before I got there. Crazy party girl, but while at work, she was a huuuuuge B word. Her and Moffet went waaaay back, so she pretty much had a non expiring ""get out of jail free"" card for anything. Then there is **Blart**. Incompetent bar manager. Picture James Gandolfini with hair (Tony Soprano), just dumber than a sack of doorknobs, cowardly and back stabbing. Always mumbled his words and never looked anyone in the eye when greeting them. Him and Mickey were a thing, hence his position as bar manager. **Bob**, the Chief Engineer. He would always come in hungover and at around 10 am he would get a sudden burst of energy by way of Bolivian coffee up his nose. He called everyone ""Guy"" and ""Girl"". **Chief** the front office manager. My direct boss and one of the best dudes I've ever worked with. I owe a good portion of my career to him. **Nena**. Front office supervisor. One of the absolute craziest persons I've ever partied with, and one of the best supervisors I had. She never reprimanded you, she always made you understand your mistake and not only how to fix it, but ways to make sure it never happened again. **The Squid**. Bartender extraordinaire and one of my oldest friends. He was my go to guy whenever i was the reason a guest was upset. He would make them forget by making them the dankest drinks. **Matty**. Bartender not extraordinaire and a degenerate fuck. Matty was the kinda guy to sleep with the young drunk cocktail servers and talk about them with the whole staff. He would always antagonize coworkers/customers to the brink of physical violence and then act like the victim when shit hit the fan. Real reprobate. **Danny** the shuttle driver. When I tell you guys he belonged in a mental institution, I am being kind. For you Office Fans, he was the Native American Creed Bratton on meth. Banquets Manager **Mr. Moon.** This guy was as raunchy as he was professional. Between all these deplorable people, he was a stand up guy. He had this saying that always stuck with me, ""Do your worst while doing your best at it"". **Lencho** the line cook. This guy lived for one thing and one thing only, getting laid. I mean, there was not one female he would not hit on and not one STD he hadn't survived. If I recall correctly, he had 6 kids with 6 different women. Aside from being a sexual deviant, the dude could cook like an angel. So these are the people that introduced me to the hospitality life. I'll mention a few others from time to time, but these are the ""Meat and Potatoes"" cast. The tales told will not be about them, but they are important because they either fueled or extinguished a guest fire at one point

"Hello everyone, it's time for another day off story. Unlike my previous tales where they've happened anywhere from months to years ago, this just happened yesterday.

As I came in for my 3-11 shift, excited that it was my Friday, I was met with a worried look from my GM. Thinking I was about to be let go, I hesitantly asked what was up (spoiler, I wasn't let go). She said she had just gotten an email from a sister property down the road that a group of 8 people, both men and women, were checking into rooms, and then getting chargebacks of about $2000. They had done this to several hotels, but am unsure exactly how they were doing it, as if the names and all that match on the id and card, and they sign the form it shouldn't work. Either way, I had the names of the 8 people, and if they attempted to check in then we were to deny service, easy.

As I sat there with no check ins, a moment of happiness occurred when I heard our automatic doors open, and in walked 2 guys looking for a room. This moment did not last long, as when they handed me an ID it was one of the names on the list. Now here's where I decided to have some fun, I started going through the reservation process like I normally would. When I gave them an insanely high rate they were taken aback, and I stated ""Well tell you what, why don't I call my boss and see if I can get that brought down for you?"" They were hesitant at first, because they obviously didn't care about the cost since they were going to try and scam us, but they decided to play along to make it seem like they cared.

I head into the back and dial the non-emergency number for our local PD, and explain everything that is going on. Since this Covid stuff is going on, there is literally nothing going on in my town, as pretty much nothing is open, so they tell me the cruiser will be there in about 5 minutes. So I have to stall these guys for that amount of time. I head back up and exclaim that she agreed and that I'd be lowering the rate for them. Then starts the slowest reservation I've ever done. I was pretending that the computer kept freezing, and was typing with my pointer fingers only. The guys were oblivious, just talking to each other, as I kept apologizing that the system was slow. One thing to note about this property, there are two areas that look like our front entrance, there is the actual one, and there is one that heads into the restaurant. These doors do not lock, so the cops, being the crafty people they are, came through the side so they wouldn't be noticed until they were standing right behind the gentlemen.

The guys turn around and immediately realized they were caught and went without a fight. The cops asked if I had seen the others, and to call them again if they show up (I doubt they will, as that's just asking to get caught). I know it's not as exciting as some of my other ones, but I more wanted to post it with the question of: Why would they try to do our hotel? That would make us the 5th that we're aware of within a 3 mile radius. Like, what is wrong with these people?Out smarting some scammers",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Just finished wrapping up the incident report for this, and started the audit, so I figured now would be a good time to post this.

I arrived for my shift at 11pm, same as always. We’ve been very low on numbers the past few weeks, for reasons everyone already knows, and tonight I’m told that we have only one room occupied for the night.

And he’s out in the lobby, drinking, and watching TV. I think “Cool, I can handle that, no problem”. I let the guest know that the lobby closes at midnight, which he accepts, and go to the back office to start prepping for the audit and reports that I’ll have to fill out for management.

A little before midnight, I look up at the cameras - a habit I’ve formed since working this property - and I find my one guest on the floor, face down, head against the wall.

I rush out, but he’s already sitting up with a *gnarly* head wound. His hair is already soaked with blood, and he’s asking me what happened.

So he’s conscious and responsive. That’s good, at least.

“You fell, dude.” I then ask him if he wants me to call an ambulance for him, to which he says no, he doesn’t ‘want anyone else involved’. So I grab some gloves, some antibiotic wipes, and some gauze to clean this guy’s cut, and bandage it up as best I can with what little surface level training I have (thanks Navy Corpsman dad). I escort him back to his room to make sure he doesn’t die on the way there, and return to the lobby.

About ten minutes later, he comes *back down* to get the liquor he had left behind (which I had already thrown away).

“Why’d you throw out my stuff?!” he asks.

I tell him he’s had enough, and that he has two options: sleep off the booze in his room, or check out now and have an accident somewhere else. He opts for the former, and I escort him back to his room to ensure he doesn’t keel over in the hallway.

Just goes to show that you can think you’ll have the easiest night ever, only for shit to hit the fan at any moment.

Hope you’re all staying safe through this.

Edit: fixed a minor typo


Edit2: To everyone saying “you should have called an ambulance anyway”. Look, I’m not a doctor. I don’t have X-ray vision. 

I’m a night auditor who asked a guy if he wanted an ambulance, and because he said he didn’t want anyone knowing where he was, I wasn’t about to breach that privacy confidentiality.

If he wants to take this to trial after the fact, fine. But we have it on camera that he denied professional medical assistance, and the hotel didn’t sell him any of the alcohol that he got drunk on.

I’ve called my manager - both immediately after the event, and this morning after he did a wellness check on the guest - and he says that he can’t find anything wrong with what I did. The guest was fine. He checked out, signed a form saying the hotel wasn’t responsible for his injuries, and walked out. 

I don’t know what else to tell you guys other than my manager has my back on this, and considering how well he knows our hotel’s policies, and how long he’s been in the business, I think it’s safe to say we’re going to be fine.Only One Guest In House And There’s Still Chaos",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hi everyone! This story is going to kick off a series of experiences I have had being in Hospitality for 15 years. Here goes nothing. 

I was working at a large full service hotel that had a green sign with yellow letters. This hotel was built in the early 60's and had a nightclub/lounge that when opened, was the place to be and a really neat Tequila bar in the lobby. I'm gonna call this place ""Freddy's Nightclub"" for anonymity and ""Tequila"" for the lobby bar. In its heyday, anyone who was anyone in the city hung out there, lawyers, politicians, etc. Sounds cool right? Well, I was employed there from 2005 through 2012, and this hotel had not been renovated since 1979, but for some odd reason, Freddy's clientele was the same. I swear it was like a time capsule in there. It smelled of cigarette smoke, hookers, and cocaine. During my tenure there, it became known as the Cougar bar since the ladies that frequented Freddy's in the 70's/80's were still going there and always tried to hook up with the younger guys. Anywho, this hotel had this aura to it where everyone who would walk in would leave their inhibitions at the door. I swear, the best people would lose their marbles here, specially when going down to Freddy's. It was surreal. 

So my first job there was night audit. I worked with two older guys. One was no nonsense, one was a sleazeball always trying to hook up with Freddy's barfly ladies. We had this group of military contractors staying with us for a few nights and right off the bat we knew it was going to be a rowdy couple of days. These guys would start drinking at ""Tequila"" around 6pm, close it down around 10 pm, and go down to Freddy's already lit. There was a Samoan guy in the group, I swear he must've been 6'6, 300 pounds of muscle. Now, for 3 nights, he was the most well behaved out of all of them. He kinda kept them in line, watched over these degenerates. Well, this one night, Samoan must've drank the fighting juice, cause our night got a hell of a lot more interesting. Around 11:30 pm, we got a call from the bartender saying they needed all hands on deck due to a rowdy patron. We all run downstairs to Freddy's and see Samoan holding server ""Baby John"" (We had two John's, one 5'10, and Baby John 5'6) up against the wall by his shirt, basically dangling him in the air. Apparently he claimed he had given Baby John a $100 bill and was not getting his change back., which Baby John vehemently denied. Everyone is trying to get Samoan off of Baby John, but were basically hitting a wall at this point. My friend ""The Squid"" (everyone has a nickname BTW) was able to knock him off balance by pressing behind Samoan's knees, so he finally let Baby John go. Now, these guys would spend upwards of $1k a night, so the Bar Manager didnt really want to kick them out, so he basically just asked these guys to watch over Samoan if not they would be kicked out. Samoan calms down and we leave.

 About an hour later, we hear shouting from downstairs and get a call to call 911 immediately. We look at the cameras and see Samoan carrying one of the female cocktail servers pretty much over his head. His friends were all trying to get him to let go, but again, no luck. Somehow they were able to get him to put her down and got him out of the bar, into the little lobby area in front of Freddy's. At this point, my two Audit coworkers and I are just watching the cameras. There was no use us going down there. PD gets there within minutes but walks in through the front lobby. Unfortunately, Officer was 5'8, 120 pounds of bones. I'm thinking, this guy is going to get thrown around, but oh well. As we are telling PD what the situation was, Samoan was walking up the stairs ready for battle. He comes up screaming we weren't shit, that he could take us all on. He damn well could've. Officer begins to try and calm him down, buts its like pissing on a forest fire at this point. By sheer luck, another two officers were walking up the stairs from Freddy's and see the situation unfolding. Samoan is basically doing the Hakka by now. One of the new officers goes stealth mode and walks around the staircase and positions himself behind Samoan without him noticing. As soon as Samoan Raises his arms in a ""Come at me"" motion, Officer Ninja gets him in a half nelson, puts his knees behind Samoans knees just like the Squid did earlier, drops him, and pushes forward, launching Samoans face straight into the white Marble lobby floor. With very little exaggeration, the crack of his forehead hitting the floor echoed the empty lobby. When his face hit the marble, it busted his eyebrow open. It was like popping a ketchup bottle. With Samoan dazed, the officers were able to handcuff him and carry him out. This whole time, my coworkers and I are just standing behind the desk, jaws on the floor. That night I learned how to clean up body fluids.  

Apparently, the next morning he came in straight out of jail, blood on his shirt, asking for a key to get his belongings because he had been terminated from the project. I wish I would've been there to see his face. Anywho, I hope you found this interesting. No joke, my coworkers that have been lifelong friends and I have all talked about writing a book with all these stories. With travel basically at a standstill because of Covid19, I have nothing but time and opportunity during my shifts. I'll be posting regularly. Have a great Easter!!I witnessed ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So my hotel closed at the end of March, but we reopened the 5th of this month. When I arrived for my first shift back, night shift, the day shift girl pulled me aside and whispered to me that our GM told her that we aren't following the state order our governor gave the 3rd of the month about restricting travelers to only people of importance, no out of state or leisure guests. I bring this up to my GM a few hours later, and she acts like she has no clue what I'm talking about. She then says that it isn't appropriate to ask guests where they are from and why there are here, she called it discrimination. The governor literally said that's what we have to do. My fellow coworkers are all freaking out. Head of housekeeping and a FD girl want to inform the authorities but are too afraid of losing their job. I was curious if anyone else is experiencing this, or of anyone has any advice on what we should do here. Our vacancy is piss poor, one guest here that's staying the entire month, no arrivals. Some of my coworkers have even suggested a walk out. Stay safe out there, guys.Not Following State Oder",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Small rant here...You have been warned.


Can someone point me to the hotel/motel that let people think that hotels stop charging for a night at midnight?! Once again, someone got pissy about having to pay for more than 1 night when they checked in at 3am! I do not understand! We put up signs when checkout is and no one can use their brains after midnight we’ll enough to think, “Hmm...Checkout’s at 11am, so that must be when they stop charging for the night.” Nope! We stop charging people for the night at midnight...you know, the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!!

"Had a guest walked in who I greeted. Typically at my property we have individually wrapped silverware that we can hand out to guests when they ask for them. Because of Corona virus stuff the place we order these from is on back order so instead we have silverware in the back that we keep just for guests to hand out to them as needed. It's covered in a plastic bag and only moved when guests need forks spoons or knives.

&amp;#x200B;

So this guest asked for some of those packets of silverware as well as some plates. I explained to him that unfortunately we ran out of the individually wrapped packets of silverware but I could grab him some forks and stuff and started to head to the back where we keep those. He stopped me

&amp;#x200B;

""Uh you don't need to go back there, you can just grab them from that cart behind you, That's where you guys usually get them from when I stay here."" 

&amp;#x200B;

To his benefit the little cart behind me is typically where we DO keep those things but as of now it's not. Because we are out.

&amp;#x200B;

I explain ""Oh yeah I know but we ran out so we have some silverware I can grab for you if you'd like form the back.""

&amp;#x200B;

To which he said to me ""Um NO, I know you guys have the silverware in that drawer, I've seen you grab it from there before.""

&amp;#x200B;

I say ""Yes sir, I know, but we don't have any of the individually wrapped silverware, we have silverware I can grab you from the back though.""  


He said ""That's what I'm saying and I'm saying it's RIGHT THERE. GOSH can't you listen?""

&amp;#x200B;

I walk to the little drawer he is talking to and open it and show him that right now instead of silverware it is filled with trash bags and ice bucket bags to hand to guests. ""Sir, I told you, they're not up here because we don't have anymore. I can get you some silverware from the back and some plates if you want me to.""

&amp;#x200B;

""So they aren't in there?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

""No, It's just bags for trash and ice."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you sure?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, I'm sorry we are out of the individually wrapped ones, but I can grab you some forks and stuff from the back."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""No  I don't want that just give me a plate I guess."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure not a problem.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I know you're saying you don't have any but I know from my past stays you do so I'll just ask the next person here for some."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I just said ""Okay"" we to the back signed super fucking loud and got him the plates he wanted. Like is it that hard to listen? Some people are just infuriating.The amount that people don't listen to me is honestly really annoying",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"New poster, on mobile, etc., etc...

I love my job. It doesn't pay much, but that doesn't really matter. It's super chill and I basically get paid to do exactly what I would at home. Browse Reddit, watch YouTube, and occasionally be tech support. The biggest difference being, I dont have access to a ton of security cameras.

Well, one day I'm watching the cameras and notice activity in guest laundry. It's basically a mini laundromat for guests to use, not the same laundry housekeeping uses. Anyway, it's a couple of kids sitting around, playing with some toys. They really shouldn't be in there unsupervised, but the virus has slowed everything down, we have no reservations for today, and they aren't in the way of anyone that might come in.

Then I see the cat. No big deal. We are pet friendly. I keep watching though because I know that one belongs to a different guest, and I don't see that particular Karen's kid. They're playing with it, petting it, stuff you do with pets, ...except the part where they decided it needed a wash and dry.

I would like to point out for anyone who may be freaking out about hurting animals, that the kids did not turn either machine on. They require money to work. They did, however, close the doors to the washer and dryer.(they eventually let it out, btw.)I immediately call their parents room as it was much closer than the front desk. No answer. Of course. 

I grab the phone since we're required to take it anytime we leave the desk, the keyring so I can get back in to the lobby, and go to confront the kids. Because they didn't do any real harm, and it isn't my place to discipline someone else's kids, I was just going to tell them they needed to stop playing in laundry and go back to their rooms.

On my way there, I spot one of the parents having a smoke (note: smoking and most pet rooms open to the outside) and so I stop and say ""hey, I was watching cameras, and just wanted to let you know your kid put a cat in the dryer and we would appreciate it if they didn't do it again."" I was quick to point out that they didn't hurt the cat, as I didn't realize until just then how terrible a sentence sounds with the words 'cat in dryer'. Well, the other parent comes out from the door and asks me to repeat myself, I do, and leave. Job done.

I haven't heard a voice or a smack that loud since I was a kid myself. I go back to the lobby to call the parents of the other kid, and I immediately hear sobbing. 'So, checkout is at 11, will you be staying another night?

Anyway that's my little story. Sorry it took so long to get to the point, if there even really is one. Not much to it, but I wanted to share because I haven't seen a similar one yet and my only other stories (not many, tbh) would be the same crackheads and ridiculous requests that most of you get.

Edit: Would like to point out that I didn't mention the kid getting smacked because I approved or thought it was responsible parenting, it was just one of the things that happenedNo, Cats are NOT Machine Washable",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"On one hand I'm glad the hotel is in business and of course I am grateful to have a job, but on the other hand, I feel like all of these incoming guests traveling from out of state as well as the locals staying here via 3rd party bookings is kind of putting our health's at risk?

Its even worse when we are getting people traveling here asking us, ""What is there to do around here?"" ""What events are going on?"" even one person today is ""traveling here to visit family, but they told me to stay here."" They almost act as nothing is really going on and it's not that big of a deal.

I get it is Easter and you miss your family but am I the only one that has decided to not see family at this time to avoid any risks??

Right now we have people coming in to train at R e D cross and there accounts are set up to be paid for all charges and all we need is to see an ID. So these guests are no risk to check in. We even have a ""6ft barrier"" roped off in front off the guest. We also have a group of people working on a ship that have been here for 2 months about 1 month before things got ""more serious"" (I put that in quotes because its always been serious but no one took action at least in my state till about a month ago). 

I guess I am saying I am fine being ""security"" watching cameras and making sure there is no theft, answering phone calls and guests request. I just don't really think its safe to have all these people traveling here for leisure, or ""for something to do.""Idk how to feel about the Hotel being ""busy""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"2 years ago, I was working in a 200 room hotel as FDA and will always remember this.

It was about 9pm and our group of about 12 Guests arrived, we had a quick check in process for them and they immediately went to the restaurant for a late dinner. I was later approached by our security at about 11pm, telling me that the same group was swimming at the beach (FYI the beach is closed at 6pm, open sea, unpredictable tide, dark, no life guard and same closing time with hotels nearby-mostly privately owned hotel beaches in the area.)
The security had successfully convinced them to get out of the water but they walked up to me at the front desk, soaking wet and complained (note that guests are not good in speaking English)

Guest: Why why! We paid for the room. We book many rooms! We only stay one night and we cannot swim! Tell me Tell me!

I politely explained that it was for their own safety and we have the same opening and closing time with other beaches blah blah blah

She was not having it and she got really mad.

Guest: No no. You cannot stop us we paid for this! I can swim, we are good swimmer. You will not be responsible if we drown. I guarantee, we are responsible for ourselves! Hotel will not be responsible.

Me: I’m very sorry, but we are responsible for your safety blah blah blah.

I tell her it’s a private hotel beach and there is no lifeguard on duty to ensure their safety.

Guest: No! You cannot stop us! You see, you do not own the sea! The sea is for everybody! You cannot buy the sea! You own the hotel yes but the sea?! No! 

My manager came to support me. We would not let them swim and the guest was furious since they are leaving the next day before sunrise (before the beach opens). The group was very disappointed. They want to swim so badly.

It was too risky and unfair to other guests if we allowed them. Despite the anger and rage she felt towards us, still managed to get a cool head after but logged everything just in case a complain turns up online.Go swim, drown and blame us after",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello everyone! Long term lurker, but I finally decided to post this story to see if anyone else gets strange phone calls when they work overnight audits. 
This happened not too long ago, its about 1:30 am and I'm sitting in the back office, eating when I hear our phone ring. I return the desk and the caller asks if he can make a reservation. I tell him of course, I would be happy to, what dates where they looking at? 
Caller: ""From Easter to Christmas."" 
Surprised, I asked the caller to repeat the dates, not only did he have a strange sound voice, but it sound like two different people were talking. 
Caller:"" Yes, from Easter to Christmas, we are sick the virus. We need to be quarantined.""
I already started to get a weird feeling about this call, so I tell the caller that we aren't a long term stay hotel and most due to system limitations, when we can do is set up the reservation for a week at a time. I told him that our rates were at $102 a night. 
Caller: ""Don't rip me off! I saw online that you have rooms for $30 a week.""
Me: ""I'm sorry? $30 a week?""
Caller: ""Yes, we can take a small room, like your janitors closet. The most we can pay is $30 a week. We have the virus. We need help.""
Me: ""Sir, what are you talking about? What website are you look at?""
The caller then gets very angry at me, calling me all sorts of nasty names and about how shitty my hotel is how he is tried of getting ripped off. If I didn't give him a room for $30 a week, I would get in big trouble. Once again, I ask him where he was getting this price from. 
Caller: ""ESPN.""
Me: ""ESPN? Sir, ESPN is a sports website.""
Caller: ""I'm not talking about sports. I saw on ESPN that you are giving rooms to people for $30 a week. I have the virus. I'm very sick. If you can't help me, I have an uncle who is a very good lawyer. He will sue you and your hotel.""
Me: ""Sir, I can't sell you a room for $30 a week. Please understand where I'm coming from here. You call my hotel at 1:30am saying that you have COVID-19, and want a room for $30 a week and you're saying that you say the price on sports website. This sounds very sketchy to me.""

"Okay! I need someone to talk to other than our crazy conspiracy theorist guest. This guy has been with us for about 2 months now all during the corona virus and ""quarantine"" He is driving my crazy trying to force me into these weird dialogues as well as getting me to buy into his conspiracies.

This was our conversation today:

He started out talking about how he is getting his car driven up to meet him at the airport in NOLA, that the people that are driving it are going to wipe down the car and spray it with disinfectant and toss the keys to him so he doesn't have to touch anyone. It cost a lot of money, also he had to tell me it was a Cadillac too. (During the whole time I don't think I showed at all any interest or care into the story so why continue).

Then shit gets weird.   

Guest: ""The Chinese did this to us!""

Me: \*nervous laughs

Guest: ""They need to pay for what they did""

Me: \*nervous laughter intensifies

Guest: ""This was a biological weapon that the Chinese were dealing with!"" ""Donald Trump really *needs* to shut down all outgoing shipments from China""

Me: ""yeah..."" \*starts slowly backing up into the back office.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the whole Corona Virus thing is controversial but I am really getting tired of the Chinese blaming. 1st, its almost border line racist, and coming out of some peoples mouth it sounds racist as fuck. 2nd, the phrases ""Fuck the Chinese"" and ""Fuck the Chinese Government"" are different, and you can derive different meanings from them. So can we please stop blaming the Chinese. This is how racism is bred. Children hearing their parents say ""Fuck the Chinese"" or ""This is the Chinese's fault"" is going to make people start to hate Chinese people in general. (Also I live in the States and we are HORRIBLE at telling people from different countries in Asia apart so that could also be really problematic).

"Thankfully I finally have something to talk about not coronavirus related!

So tonight during audit I happened to be going through camera footage looking for a specific vehicle for totally different purposes. I noticed my GSR going I to a guests room and honestly kinda overlooked it at first.. then later in the night it hit me, why the hell is this kid in a guests room??? 

My first thought was “okay who knows about this?” Because this stuff doesn’t stay quite so I started phishing... found out I’m probably the last one to hear. Apparently another staff member had brought it to the attention of my GM and his response was “I don’t wanna hear anything”... my GM is notorious for not doing his job... and making me, the MOD do everything for him and I’m tired of it, if I’m doing his job I want that position. Also, this particular GSR is terrible at his job and I cannot stand dealing with the drama that comes with him not being able to do his job correctly.

So I’m at an impasse.. do I keep my mouth shut and avoid creating any drama or blow this the hell up because I now have a staff member telling me that she told my GM and nothing was done. And throw this gsr and gm under the bus? 

I know the latter is a shitty thing to do, but I also really wanna do it... any advice or similar fun stories?


Edit:

Ended up calling my district manager, told her I didn’t want to get into anything too specific but that I felt she should remind all team members that sleeping with guests is against policy and that if anyone is found to be doing that they would be terminated. She was more then happy to help, And said she would be sending out a sexual harassment video out to all properties as well. If there was any further issue to call her directly or notify hr. She told me if I gave her the specifics she’d handle it immediately but honestly, if I get gsr fired I’m gonna be the one who has to pick up the shift and I barely want to be working right now as it is... plus this kid gives us reasons to fire him on a monthly basis...

Gm is already digging his own grave... I don’t need to beat a dead horse. I was just really pissed earlier now I kinda just don’t care...Night audit took a scandalous turn!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Idk why this annoys me. 

A couple will come up to the desk,

"I'm a little worried I might lose my job over this, and I might need some help. For some backstory, I just started working at a motel three weeks ago. A scary looking dude came in as a walk in asking for a one bed room for one night. He pulls out a credit card and an ID to check in. I went through the process as usual, and I realized after checking him in that the name on the credit card didn't match the one on his license. I bring this up to my manager on duty and she immediately texts my boss saying that I checked in the dude, effectively telling on me. I'm new to the job and due to this whole virus thing I'm worried I might not get another one for a while if I lose this one, do I have any reason to be worried? I'm technically still in training and I haven't been written up for anything before. I called the motel after I left for the night and clocked out, and I asked if the guy was kicked out or if anything happened. She told me that nothing happened yet but she checked his stay records and apparently he has used stolen credit cards to check in at our property and rent from us before, and no one has noticed that he has been doing this until this evening. We haven't let anyone go in a while and I am a new hire, so I'm still wondering if anything that went down this evening is a reason to let me go on the spot when I come in to work tomorrow. Any help/comments would be appreciated. thank you :)

"So last month before all this COVID-19 stuff turned the industry and my town (Las Vegas) into a baren wasteland we had 2 rooms booked on our first floor by a Mom and Daughter of a Smilton out in a neighboring state come stay with us to celebrate the daughter's 21st Birthday. Now they were friendly enough although progressively got worse over their stay. 

Day #1- Just basically overall drunken fun (Partying in the rooms and Noise Complaints)

Day #2- One of the girls got so drunk she had to be wheeled to her room on a Bellcart

Day #3- Now this is where all hell breaks loose. First off I am training a new part time relief Night Auditer. She has experience at other hotels and I have known her for 2 years by this point. But it is the first night I am training her at this property. Everything is going smoothly until a little after Midnight the hotel fire alarms start to go off. Now this isnt just the normal (Someone smoking in a room....or burnt something cooking) But a full on every alarm in the entire hotel going off type of situation. I call my Houseman and he says that he sees smoke coming from down the hall on the first floor. So as with any evacuation situation i stay at the front desk to answer the inevitable flood of phone calls from the guests asking if this is a False Alarm or a real fire. I let every caller know that ""Yes this is real and to please evacuate the hotel via the nearest stairwell"". The new girl in training asks me what she can do. I let her know to call the General Manager while i call the Head of Maintenance/Field Guest Calls. As this is happening the guests slowly start to exit the hotel. 

A Few minutes later the Fire Department arrive and rush in. I hand them an occupied room list and direct them to where our Houseman is seeing smoke coming from. Now as this is happening the General Manager/Head of Maintenance/Local PD are pulling up and rushing into the hotel. While everyone is being Rock Stars and handling their business a couple guests were trying to rush inside to use the public bathroom. Seriously?? Yep. A lady was arguing with me that her mother needed to go pee. I tried directing her to a neighboring bar not even 100 feet away but she just wanted to argue because ""How dare you not let my mother inside"" SORRY LADY AS OF THIS POINT THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID NO ONE BACK IN FOR ANY REASON. She seriously argued with me for 10 minutes instead of walking 1 minute away to the bar next door. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well 15 minutes later we find out it wasnt a fire. It was someone had taken a Fire Extinguisher and sprayed it all down the first floor hallway which of course from a distance looks like smoke, and the chemical gets into the sensor units and sets everything off. Now after everything had quieted down and people were about to be let back inside we figure out between the location of the incident, and the people who 30 seconds before hand were witnessed running up and down the hallway that it was the 2 employee rooms that i mentioned above. They were standing by their car in the parking lot waiting for things to die down so they could slip back in. Well my awesome General Manager wasnt having any of that. She kicked them out and when staff went in their room they found a busted lamp and some other damaged hotel property. So guess who got charged damages......turned in to their General Manager.... and overall (i am assuming) both lost their jobs?

&amp;#x200B;

**AFTERMATH:**

We had to give a couple comped rooms, 1 complaint from a guest claiming that i was rude to 2 women who ""Just wanted to know when they could get back to their rooms"" (Sorry dude you obviously didnt hear what really happened), and i got a couple good comments from guests praising how the staff handled everything.Tale of the Drunken 21st Bday and a full Hotel Evacuation....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Have I got a doozy for ya! I get to work to cover the 3-11 shift. Since we furloughed everyone, management has been doing the majority of the operations, which is fine. It's cute to see my GM at the desk and he knows nothing about Opera so I have to teach him everything. 

Anyway, he makes sure I'm clocked in and then asks me if I know the guy in 810. He's been here for a few days and keeps extending. Our DND policy is three days, and today's the day. 

Housekeeping opens the door and calls the front desk immediately to get him up there. Tells him to bring gloves.

"Just curious how often anyone else here has someone do this...

Back when I was greener in the industry and I worked at a property with vending machines, a guy came waltzing through the lobby and told me the machine ate his 20. He wasn’t rude or pushy and I was much more trusting of strangers than I am now, so I just reimbursed him out of the drawer. The next day I told the boss about it and he said I was probably scammed and we went and checked the vending machine. Sure enough there wasn’t a 20 in there. Lesson learned. 

Tonight I’m working audit at a different property with no vending machines, only a market that every sale goes through me. A trashy individual and his girlfriend walk in, and walk by the market. The guy asks me if we have any vending machines. I tel him no, all we have is what’s up front. He doesn’t inquire about prices or anything and takes nothing more than a cursory look at what we have. Then he asks if we have an ATM, which we don’t. He again looks at the market and says to the girl, ‘they don’t have shit here’, not true at all as we have pretty much every candy you could think of and a ton of different drink options. 

They walk out the front door and I get to thinking how odd it was to do that; go shopping at a hotel for things you’d typically get down the road at a gas station. Then they don’t even ask how much our stuff was. They looked like your typical junkie couple that would rent a hotel in the town they live in and get into arguments in the parking lot so they wouldn’t have gotten anything from me now like they might have a couple years ago.

"Introduction: I’d like to start out by saying that this is my first ever time posting on subreddit and I apologize for my fresh account. I actually had to make a new account for this post to remain anonymous. With that being said, here is the context of this story.

Context: I work at a fairly busy hotel and I’ve been working there for 2 years. We were fully booked that night and had no room for error. Our parking lots are always empty too because the guests are usually out having fun. I really love my job, especially when people act the way they do. It makes my experience all the more interesting. With that being said, this particular encounter was out of this world to me. That is saying a lot because as most of you already know, we encounter lots of different situations working the front desk. In this instance, it was nearing the end of my shift (3pm-11pm) and this ill-mannered lady came up to me at around 10pm requesting a room. Nothing too strange about that of course, it’s what happens after...

Cast: Me= Me &amp; Lady= L

Story: L walks up to the front desk looking rather impatient and there is something off about her. She asks for room prices and I respectfully tell her that we are fully booked tonight. This is how the conversation went-

L: What’s the cost for a room for tonight!?

Me: Hello! Unfortunately ma’am, we are fully booked for tonight and I can’t give you a room.

L: Well that’s just a lie because your parking lot is empty!

Me: It may look like we have rooms available, but the parking lot is empty because everyone is still out and about.

L: Well, how about the hotel next door? Can you check on your computer to see if they have any vacancies?

Me: Sorry ma’am, but my computer only shows the status of this hotel. If you need to, give them a call to find out!

L: I actually don’t have my phone on me, call them for me.

(At this point, I felt kinda bad for her cause she did seem desperate to get a room. So me being the employee I am, I went ahead and called the next door hotel for her. They were fully booked too.)

Me: Ma’am, that hotel is fully booked too.

L: Well where the hell am I going to stay tonight then?! I need you call another hotel for me because it is unfair to me and it’s your responsibility to help me.

(I didn’t like that one bit, but fuck it. I called another hotel for her.)

Me: *still on the line with other hotel* Again, this hotel is fully booked too...

L: Let me see that! *grabs the phone out of my hand* Hello!? Yeah, hi, I really need a room for tonight. I don’t care that there are “no rooms”, I demand to talk to a manager!

(The fact that she grabbed the phone out my hand and completely disregarded my personal space made me FURIOUS. As she was waiting to get in touch with a manager from the other hotel, I ended the call by pushing the little button where the phone rests on.)

L: Wtf! Why did you end the call?!

Me: You can’t just snatch the phone out of my hand and disrespect me like that ma’am. I’m happy to help you, but you really need to calm down and respect me just like I am respecting you.

L: I don’t have to do shit. You’re the one that needs to help ME. I don’t give a fuck about your respect!

(Never in my entire life have I gotten so mad. My blood was BOILING after she said that.)

Me: Yeah, you’re gonna have to leave.

L: Fuck you, I’m not leaving! Call every hotel for me right now, or I’ll have you FIRED.

Me: No, I am not going to call every hotel to check availability for you. You can do that yourself.

L: You know what? Fuck you and fuck this ugly ass hotel. I don’t give a shit anymore. You’re not worth my time anyways you piece of shit. *Repeatedly slaps the front desk* I NEED A ROOM MOTHER FUCKER SO JUST FUCKING HELP ME!!!

Me: YOU’RE NOT GETTING A ROOM BECAUSE I HAVE NO ROOMS. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL. I AM GOING TO CALL THE POLICE IF YOU DON’T LEAVE RIGHT NOW!

L: WHATEVERRRRRR, I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE!

(After that wonderful statement, she storms out making sure I hear every stomp of her shoes.)

Conclusion: Looking back at this moment, I shouldn’t have ended her call, but damn I got so infuriated when she took the phone out my hand. It’s funny too, I never yell at guests, this was the only exception. How’s that for an interesting experience at work?

"Hello everyone, today's tale isn't really too long, although I've said that about some of my other stories, and they became novels, I'm pretty long winded so apologies if that happens again. This is a story about a ~~asshole~~ gentleman, and his daughter. This happened at my current property that I am the Front Office Manager (yes that comes into play) and this was before everyone got the rona.

It's a typical Tuesday, which for an Airport property can get pretty busy, as a lot of business travelers will come in after their three day weekends I gather, and stay with us for the week. This puts us at about 80-85% occupancy. So my FDA's and I were shooting the shit to pass the time when asshole and his spawn come walking in. He is about late 20's early 30's (not too important just some info) and the child looks like she is 15 (this is very important). He begins the check in with me, and he isn't really anything too much, a little snippy and short with me, but that could be for any reason, his child always chimed in whenever something remotely mean was said to agree. Our property for our top two tier shiny members get drink vouchers that can be used for a free drink in the store next to the desk, or money off an alcoholic beverage from our bar. You get one voucher for every day of your stay, and this guy was here two nights, so, two vouchers (this also is important) and I explain to him exactly what they're for, and in my opinion, I was nothing but kind to this man that has been rude to me.

Surprisingly, his stay goes off without a hitch, so I chalk it up to him just being crabby from a drive, or hangry. Lo and behold the 1/10 review I receive on our review tracker. He stats this, ""The front desk team at check in were all lazy, and none of them made an attempt to try and check my daughter and I in, and it wasn't until I had to forcibly get their attention before one of them begrudgingly came to help. The check in process was slow, and the agent was very clearly annoyed with being alive apparently, but I also noticed he kept eyeing my daughter. He then gave me two free alcohol vouchers for my UNDERAGE daughter, and myself, where I don't even drink, so they weren't even useful. We get to the room and it is dilapidated and old. We had been traveling all day so just stuck with it, even with the bugs roaming the floor. We tried to go get dinner at the in house restaurant, and went around the desk because I didn't want the pedophile behind the counter eyeing up my UNDERAGE daughter again. I will be filing a complaint with corporate, and a police report for them to look into that creep. I would rate this a 0/10 if it let me, and I think &lt;brand name&gt; should be dropped from the &lt;corporate&gt; flag.""

My boss calls me in to her office and we talk about it, with both of us knowing it is all bullshit, and then talk to corporate together to see what they wanted to do. He repeated everything from the review to corporate, with one extra detail, he went as far to say that when his daughter was going to the pool in her swimsuit, I approached her, and tried to hit on her. I was shocked and absolutely disgusted by the notion, like, physically ill from the thought. Corporate hears my reaction and could tell it was all a lie, and said they will deal with it. Thankfully, no police have come to me so I have to explain this guy's screwed up story to them.The lie.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I had a front desk manager who was really cool and young spirited and he loved hiring young people (college students), I think he just liked talking to us and interacting with us, kept the workplace young and vibrant and maybe even made him feel younger again. The drawback of this was that their were some flaky ones who didn’t last very long and sometimes it felt like a revolving door at the desk, but I liked it, as I got to meet a lot of new people and get some experience training new people.

There were two people on staff at all times at the desk and most of the student employees worked part time, so we had a fairly big staff of like 10 (+/-). One of the auditors (night shift folks) randomly did a no-call-no-show and so the manager decided to move one of the existing staffers to audit and find a new hire for the evening shift. Cool. I am evening shift so I get all the anxiety/excitement of getting real comfortable with the new person.

Enter our [hero](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Bickle). A 6’7” extremely thin man with jet black hair and a slouch; he reminded me of the [main character from the video game Catherine (2011)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc6wG0o_v5k) and had a similar posture and gait. Funny cause I know about the game per this guy’s recommendation (good game). He was an interesting guy, very subdued and mild mannered, and bright. He had varied interests and was a joy to be on a shift with really... at first.

I’m gonna call the hero (bothered for sarcasm) Jojo, because at the very peak of all of his many interests, he was a real [weaboo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophilia#21st_century) and especially loved [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo's_Bizarre_Adventure:_Stardust_Crusaders) which was all well fine and dandy because I liked the show too and it was a fun talking point... at first.

JoJo was obsessed with the hero Jotaro Kujo and wanted to be just like him. He talked about women in the same way. Wore the guys hat. I mean, this guy was a super fan.

In fact, this man was just given to intense investment in specific pieces of media, they were his inamorata. All of this pointed to JoJo maybe being a bit of a lonely guy who coped through media, which I sympathized with. But he was also given to a system of strange, schizotypal, metamagical beliefs: he didn’t believe in eating vegetables at all (a living vestige from childhood pickiness?), he didn’t believe in wearing socks, he proclaimed belief in the pantheon of greek gods as well as a prime mover (in other words, he had a self-defined, Frankenstein’s-monster religion which cherry-picked facets of other religions), he solipsistically referred to other people as fodder/NPCs and seemed to carry an antisocial worldview. But he was cordial to those around him, and so it kind of made me think that he was a covert narcissist and just had a warped world view such that he manipulates people just to get by. Not the kind of person I’d want to be friends with, but working with him, well I didn’t really give a fuck. His toxic actual personality started to leak into conversation when he (I guess) decided I was cool, but I was okay to work with shit people, had been at it for a while after all.

I helped to train JoJo and he had become rather proficient in the job rather quick, as I said he was fairly bright. Other than having hairy conversation, he was a pretty straight arrow in the workplace, with the only problems being that he made odd notes in the log book.

One day I was on a shift with him and it drug on a bit (as those 3-10pm shifts tend to do), but at about midway through the shift I checked in an odd couple, an older gentleman with a younger woman. Soon thereafter the man left. Anyways, I won’t go into too much detail, but we made passive question of whether it was a sex trafficking situation going on. I thought we were just joking around about it. Typically what I look for is a man talking for a young girl or man and them looking spaced out like they’re drugged, I don’t think I have ever been genuinely convinced that I saw human trafficking going on in my hotel experience (thank god). Well, JoJo was different. Shortly after this I went on my 30 min lunch, when I came back I noticed that he had reopened the reservation (as it was the most previous) on my computer. Okay, wtf (have always logged out before lunch since that day). He brought the couple up a few more times that night, and seemed kind of preoccupied with it, but I wasn’t too concerned. He gave me a weird vibe with his bizarre sense of justice and I honestly thought “I hope this dumbass doesn’t call the management and make an ass of himself (or worse the cops).” Pshaw! If only that were what he’d done lol. The shift ended, I said goodbye and I thought that was the end of that. 

I was on the schedule with him the next day, but when I clocked in it became apparent that I was working it with my manager.

I subtly tried to deduce where JoJo was at. The manager was rather evasive about it at the time and just told me that he had to be let go.

Anyways, months and months and months later, I am a lot closer to the manager (even though we had ceased working at that hotel for different reasons), and we are drinking and I randomly think to ask what happened to that bizarro behemoth JoJo.

Turns out the GM had instructed him not to tell anyone when it happened, but JoJo had taken the phone number from the reservation and - I kid you not - like he is Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, he called the number and it was the girl’s and he was offering to save her and said that he was the tall one at the front desk, and that a “delicate little pixie” shouldn’t be “left to the wolves.” 

The man who checked this girl in was her father (guess JoJo didn’t notice the reservation was a double queen marked for 2 adults), anyways, her father had just left the room for a bit and came back in through an external exit such that we didn’t see him come back. The father and daughter were traveling to get her moved to college.

Our morning staff wound up getting a huge earful and and being sworn to secrecy and the room was refunded for all charges.

Didn’t know if I should post this on here or r/letsnotmeet because I hope I don’t get tangled back up into that weirdo’s bizarre adventure ever again.

"Thought I'd share this story from the days where I worked as a hotel bellman. 

So no shit there I was, last summer working hourly at a hotel chain. It's entry, I'm working towards finding a career but not really having any luck. Working bellman at my hotel was a method to keep the lights on and a roof over my head. 
At the time I was experiencing something of a backslide in life. Friends of mine were steadily moving away, I lived in a low income neighborhood with manipulative roommates, and a whole lotta extra baggage. The point is that I was working a shit job, living in a shit place and having a shitty time. 
I worked this job for months and the toll was wearing on me, taking me to some dark places. Hounded by bills and treading on eggshells constantly when I was home, the anxiety was real. 

Walking down a hallway with a passive aggressive sticky note from a coworker to me in my hand, a walkie talkie and keys on my belt I came up behind this dad and his son on their way to the elevator. They'd just left the pool and the father was singing to his little kid (2yo most likely)
*""Just call on me brother, when you need a hand!""* 
So naturally I do the super rational and very professional thing and I sing as I'm walking by. 
""We all need somebody, to lean on!"" 
And this guy. This fuckin guy points at me and sings with this huge grin on his face. 
""You just might have a problem that I'd understand!"" 
And then just as I'm walking away we duet the last line. 
""We all need somebody to lean on!"" 

I have zero doubt that we sounded awful. I don't doubt that it was weird. But at the same time that was just precisely what I needed. The moment I had with that dad and his kid was just too wholesome and it honestly did so much to lift my spirits. 
I don't work that hotel anymore, but that memory always stuck with me.The best day of work I'd ever had",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm the last hourly on staff. Got moved to Night Audit to keep me on. Honestly, I expected to be let go on April 1, as soon as the airline crew stopped their nightly rooms. Making it two weeks longer than everyone else has been extremely bittersweet. I don't adapt to 3rd shift very well, so my sleep patterns have been insane, and I'm barely functional when I get home, but am wired at work. I've had to stop printing 90% of the audit reports to save paper, and when I started just stripping all the Vacant Dirty rooms, it helped the night go by faster. I got the hotel almost completely caught up on towels, I folded about a jillion pillowcases and decorative toppers. Then I started cleaning rooms 3 days ago. Set the phone to cordless, go up while everything is empty, and clean as best as I can.

But it all ends tomorrow. Management has made the (wise) call to have me laid off, effective Monday morning. On one hand, I'm glad, because I can resume a normal sleep schedule, and I know they won't fight my UI claim. But on the other, I feel terrible for my GM and AGM. They never asked for this, and the day 95% of the hourly staff was laid off, my GM started crying when I joked about getting fired. I've never had a management team so dedicated on keeping their staff happy, and worrying about their personal situations. I'm proud of them and how much work they've done to keep this place going and keep at least one person on staff. I couldn't have asked for a better manager.

I've been guaranteed to be back when they can resume normal-ish hours. And I absolutely will come back. I do not want to see this hotel fail. I'll post some more stories when I come back. Best wishes everyone, stay safe, stay healthy, may a Karen never darken your desk, and may the Snowflakes melt away.Well gang, it's been...Something",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So an old lady arrived to front desk in the evening around 10:30pm. She arrived from the stairways of the hallway and was wearing only her pijamas walking barefoot. She stopped 6 meters from the desk and just stared at me with empty look on her face. After an awkward stare down I asked if I could help her with anything. 

Old lady: ""I went to sleep, and suddenly I was awake. Everybody was awake and I was not in my room.""

Me: ""What do you mean everybody was awake?"" 

The hotel is dead empty and I doubt there was anyone on the hallway she came from. 

Old lady: ""Oh, you don't know. You don't know..."" \*Creepy chuckle\*

I made a conclusion that she must have been sleep walking and now she’s just confused. I asked for her room number but she didn’t remember it. I asked for her last name but that didn’t exist in our system. I asked for her id but that was a stupid question since she was just wearing a pijama. 

Then I asked under which name was the reservation they made and she told that hers. Impossible. Is this person a freakin' ghost?

Asked if she came here with someone else and the answer was: ""Yes, my husband.""

I asked for her husband’s last name and that last name I found from the system staying in one of our rooms. Called the room, woke up the husband and got the old lady back to sleep.

"We are, thankfully, still open and as the full-time night auditor and since I'm 6 years into this property, dependable, and completely flexible - I thankfully have only dropped 1 day/week in hours.  In fact, I've been able to pick up 2 other shifts due to scheduling conflicts with the rest of the crew.

Now, we are getting by with about 10-15 rooms per night.  I'm sure the company is losing money in the short term, but they have not closed as of yet.

Now, with the small number of guests, my job has never been easier.  No breakfast to get ready, no coffee to set up- so after the audit is done, the rest of the night SHOULD simply me be playing the game-du-jour and keeping an eye on things.

Tonight though has been just been filled with interruptions and dumbness - from 2 sources.

First - as soon as I get in, I find out room x05 (who I had red flags from last night) made a reservation for tonight.  But, that card declined.  They locked the room out waiting for the guest to come back to the hotel.  The person supposedly called a few hours before my shift to give a different card - and that declined as well.  So, I went to the room to make sure the guest was locked out, and to see what items they still had in the room.

Other than a coffee mug, some pens, and some vaping thing - nothing else was in the room.  Unless you count the absolute mess they left the room in.  Food boxes everywhere, trash on the floor and desk, window open, used condom on the messed up beds, etc...  So - I'm still hoping they show up tonight so I can give them their junk and tell them to never stay here again.  Name and address on the room indicates this twatwaffle lives like 3 blocks away.  Local dirtbag trash.

2nd is a female dirtbag trash, from 1 town over (15 min drive).  Been here 2 nights, supposedly.  Day by day reservation.  First, she calls (sounds drunk, stoned or high) and asks how to rent a movie.  We don't have PPV services (thank Gawd) so I tell her so.  2nd call 15 mins later says her toilet won't flush and to ""send maintenance"".  Now, we wouldn't have a maintenance guy in at 11:30 pm either way, especially during this pandemic.  I ask her a few questions to see if she even tried fixing it, and the answer of course was ""no"".  I told her I would come down to check it out, and in the less than 30 seconds it took for me to get down there, she had fixed it.  Probably either the flapper didn't close for the tank to fill, or some other such easy problem that anyone could fix if they just took a second or 2 to check things out themselves.  Took her longer to call and complain than it would have taken to just take a look.   But, no, this was not the last time I would hear from this space case.

About 30 minutes later, she calls and says her shower isn't working.  I go there right away - and of course there was nothing wrong with it.  She wasn't pulling the handle out - just turning it right and left.  Again - probably because she is high and mechanically challenged.  Not sure why she felt the need to be showering at midnight either.

And, she keeps going in and out to smoke.  It's 3AM now, and every time I hear the automatic doors open, I jump up to see what's up.  It's just space case going in and out to smoke again.  This has happened at least 5 times.

I'm thinking someone else paid for her stay here.  She asked me what she needed to do if she wanted to stay another night, and I told her.  Here's hoping whoever paid to get her away from them doesn't spring for another night.What SHOULD be a quiet night.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So this happened a while ago (Before worldwide quarantine became a thing), but I hadn't reached the karma min to post it till recently. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been working as a front desk agent for about a week. It's my first time working at a hotel, so I'm still learning the ropes even though I'd previously worked as a check-in agent for a cruise line. I'm working the afternoon shift and things have been pretty slow, couple of check-ins here and there and that's about it. It's about 7 pm when this lady (We'll call her... Libbie) comes in and, after talking things out at the valet, makes her way over to me. We exchange greetings, and she tells me she would like to reserve a room but ""only for a couple of hours"". Obviously, we're not a motel, so I let her know the minimum of time she could reserve a room for would be a full night. After asking what the price would be ($240 which is waaaaay too much for the kind of hotel I work at, btw) she agrees and hands me her credit card.

This is where things get... weird. As soon as I ask her for I.D. to make the reservation, Libbie backtracks and says that she doesn't want her name anywhere on the reservation and would like to make it under the name of the guy who would be joining her later, instead. I pause for a moment, and after asking her again if she was planning on using the room as well, I tell her that I at least need to put her name into the accompanying list for the room. I reassure her that only the employees would be able to see said list and that no, the guy she was planning to meet wouldn't see it.

I would like to make it very clear that throughout this whole interaction Libbie has been super composed, kind, and understanding. At this point, however, I'm just thinking she's here for a one night stand and doesn't want the dude to know anything about her because she's probably married or something. Which, I can work with sure, but why not just actually get a motel lady??

This theory of mine is further solidified when Libbie asks me to make a note in the reservation so that, if any point we need to address her by name around the dude, we wouldn't call her by her real name and instead, she gives me a fake name (or so I thought) to address her by. At this point, I'm obvs bewildered but still trying to be accomodating and trying really hard not to let it show how much I'm trying to figure out what the heck is going on lmao. We go through the rest of the check-in process and she even goes as far as showing me a pic of the dude so I'll know who he is when he comes in. I hand her the key and she heads to her room.

About an hour later, mystery dude walks in (lets call him Jake). My coworker (who has no clue of anything) ends up checking him in, so I don't really get to see much of Jake. To be honest at this point I still wasn't giving the whole thing much thought other than ""that's a bit weird lol"".

Not even thirty minutes have passed since Jake went up when Libbie comes back down and hands me BOTH keys (They'd both received one each) says ""Thank you"" in the most serious yet cordial way and then walks off.

Multiple thoughts went through my mind as this lady was making her way to the valet:

1. ""That was way too fast even for a quickie""
2. ""Why the heck did she give me two keys? Where's Jake?""
3. ""Libbie, please tell me you didn't murder Jake.""

Security is standing behind me staring Libbie down probably having the same thought process as I am (The Supervisor for security usually spends the night hanging out at F.D.). My coworker and I are whispering with each other still trying to figure out what the heck happened because that **did not** look like a lady who had just had a pleasant romp in the sheets.

Cue Jake coming down the stairs and ""okay we can breathe, he's not dead"". Now what happened next we couldn't see because we suddenly had an onslaught of distressed passengers (Like 30........... I wanted to die) so I thought I wouldn't find out what the heck had actually happened between Libbie and Jake.

BUT THEN........ the worker from the valet came over and boooooy did he have some tea to spill.

Turns out that Libbie had gone as far as asking valet guy to park her car in a way that the license plate wouldn't be visible. Why? Because, turns out that Jake is Libbie's husband.

And you might be asking yourself by this point ""Why has this lady gone through so much trouble to hide anything that might give her identity away from her husband?"" Well, dear reader, because the alias that Libbie gave me **just so happened to be the name of the girl Jake was cheating on her with.**

This woman. Somehow. Got her cheating ass husband to believe that his ""girlfriend"" had booked them a sweet sweet night at the hotel only for him to show up and find his wife sitting on the bed instead.

**This B.A.M.F. of a woman** came back downstairs after probably massacrating the heck out of this idiotic **boy** with not a hair out of place and calmly had the valet bring both of their cars back and then patiently waited for Jake-Smchake to get his sorry ass back to the lobby so that she could extend her hand and demand their house keys from him. She then got into her car, and just drove away.

The only thing that would've made this even better was if Jake-Smchake's ""girlfriend"" had also been there to tear into him as well. I like to think she had a part to play in this whole thing, since how else would Libbie have managed to trick him into getting to the hotel.

Point is, this woman is all I aspire to be.

TL;DR B.A.M.F. of a woman tricked her cheating husband into thinking his girlfriend had booked them a night at a hotel only for him to walk in and find her instead.I thought she was checking in for a one-night stand.... boy was I glad to be wrong.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello all, hope everyone is doing as well as they can be. It's my weekend, and what better way to start the first day of it with a story for the fine folks here! As the title implies, there are two stories here, both relatively short, but just some ones I can look back at and laugh (kinda).

1: It was an early morning shift, I had to go early since night audit had to go and take care of a family matter. I'd say about 5:30 AM, maybe 6 AM, and I had worked the night before, so this was a turnaround shift, with less hours of sleep than a normal one. It was slow, and I was just kind of, there. Then, the phone rings, and I will introduce the cast. Creepy guy (CG), and myself (me!)

Me: \*\*Normal phone spiel\*

CG: Uh...yeah....um, what's you guys' rate?

Me: What day are you looking for, as our rates change daily.

It was at this moment I noticed that the guy was breathing pretty heavily, but I didn't think anything more of it.

CG: I want it tonight \*heavy breathing\* how much?

Now I hear a faint slapping noise, I wish it was him clapping his hands, but we all know it isn't. Still, I don't know if it was because I was tired, or just tried to play it in my head that nothing was happening, I continued.

Me: Uh, well tonight we're at ab-

CG: Uh GOD just keep talking to me man, you tell me that rate!

At this point I hung up. I'm betting it was a prank call, but you just never know, and I really didn't want to hear a man finish over the phone.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2: This is a tale of entitlement from a top tier shiny member. This guy stayed at our property pretty much 2 weeks of every month, and as a result became very entitled to everything. This property had the rooms with the actual hot tubs in them, but only three of them, and Mr. Shiny ALWAYS got a comp upgrade to one of them. The day of the incident, we were sold out of everything, except for about two regular King rooms. Mr. Shiny decided to make a reservation through the app day of arrival, and I'm sure everyone knows what happens. After we attempted to get a message via text, call, and email, met with no responses I anxiously awaited his arrival, and prepared for the shit storm that was about to happen.

Mr. Shiny arrives, on his cell phone as always, and walks to the desk and waits (this is his way of saying, check me in but I don't want to talk) I checked him in, and tried to explain what his room was, but I was ignored and he went to his room. He makes it around the corner, and I immediately hear him say ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!"" and he comes back towards me, suddenly not on the phone anymore.

Mr. Shiny: Why am I not on the first floor, that's where the hot tub rooms are? I don't recognize you, you must be new, around here, I get a comp upgrade to those rooms whenever I come in.

Me: Mr. Shiny, I am not new, I was the one who checked you in the past 5 times you have stayed with us, and am well aware of what we normally do for you, however, tonight you made your reservation on a sold out night, and the room I gave you is one of the last two that were available, neither an upgrade.

Mr. Shiny: Well that's just unacceptable, you're new so I'll explain (I literally just told you I'm not new) whenever I stay here, I get an upgrade, as I am most of your business. Now you will kick one of those people that booked my room out, and you will give me the keys.

Me: I will not be doing that, and should you decide to escalate this any further, I will be removing you from the property.

Mr. Shiny: THIS IS RIDICULOUS! THOSE ARE MY ROOMS AND YOU WILL GIVE ONE TO ME NOW, OR YOU WILL BE KISSING YOUR JOB GOODBYE! DO NOT FUCK WITH ME KID!

Me: Alright sir, please hand me your keys and I will fix this.

Mr. Shiny: Damn straight you will \*smug smile\*

Me: Thank you for returning your keys, now I am going to ask you to please leave the property. I warned that if you continued you would be removed, and I do not take kindly to being threatened. Before you explode at me again, I would also like to note that I will not hesitate to get police involved, so choose what your next actions are very carefully.

His smug smile disappeared, only to be replaced by pure rage. He did not say a word, and simply left (I know, surprised me too). A few days later corporate called, and he had filed a complaint against me, which was ignored. He did not return to the property, which we were all thankful for, as nobody liked dealing with the giant man baby anyways.OP gets a creepy call, plus bonus story",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I worked for almost 2 years as a manager of a party hostel in a small city in Europe. We are in the busiest location in the city, in the pedestrian zone and we have seen our fair amount of crazy. But this story just stuck with me.

During summertime, one full house Saturday, my receptionist and I checked in a very nice girl who has never stayed in the hostel before. She was very nice and since all our dorm rooms are mixed gender, we tried to put her in the nicest 4-bed dorm we had, gave her the bottom bunk and there was another girl staying also. 

Later that evening, 2 local lads checked in her room also. One of the lad started hitting on the poor girl and she brushed him off saying she is not interested. He kept the banter going with his friend and after a while, they stopped messing with her. She did not come to reception at this point to complain or anything. All of them then went to sleep. Somewhere in the middle of the night, she came to reception make a complaint to the night staff. 

During the night, the guy who got rejected by her earlier took his dick out and started pissing on her head while she was sleeping. He was not moonwalking, he was just a massive idiot.

Our night porters manage to kick both of the lads out of the hostel but we did not have a spare bed to move the poor girl to the other room. 

The next morning I had to apologize to her, make sure she was ok, gave her a full refund back and found her a new hostel to stay. 

What a pleasant first-time hostel experience. 

And then friends ask me why I would never stay in the shared dorms in hostels.

"So, after trying as hard as possible to stay open, our corporate umbrella decided my small, independently owned hotel is closing, starting Monday. The remaining staff is being furloughed until we can reopen.

But that's not the point of the story (only partially). I just had a guy walk in and ignore me when I told him he needs to step back out into the vestibule so I can communicate with him. He then asks if the owners are here and if so, can he speak to them. I fake call (the owners don't generally get involved with guests unless absolutely, positively necessary) and tell him no, they're not. He also asks what our rates are, to which I tell we're closing as of tomorrow (we're not taking new reservations).

He then tells me he's the nephew of our former manager, he used to work here (true on both, but he only worked here for maybe a week before he flipped out on a guest), and what are our weekly rates. I told him, again, we're not offering weekly rates, or daily rates because we're closing tomorrow. He says he didn't care, what are the rates. I told him what the rate *would* be if we were remaining open. He walked out the door screaming Joward Honson next door was only $50.

"I’m an Events Manager covering 2 hotels in the UK. Due to the current situation, I helped out on a couple of shifts on Reception last week between the government announcing the shut down on Monday night, and the hotel officially closing on the Thursday. During this time we had a skeleton staff working to ensure all bookings were cancelled, areas deep cleaned and the building secured etc. 

One day, I was tasked with calling every direct booking arriving between then and the end of April to advise of the hotel closure, telling them their booking was cancelled and assisting with any refunds. Over the course of one day I spoke to probably 70 or 80 guests and nearly every single one of them couldn’t have been nicer or more understanding. A couple of them even nearly made me cry NGL.

But there’s always one...

Me: Good afternoon Sir, this is XX calling from XX. 

Guest: Oh hi there

Me: I’m just calling to advise that due to the current Government recommendations I’m afraid the hotel is now closed for the foreseeable future, so I’m afraid we do have to cancel your reservation for [date]

Guest: What do you mean you’re just cancelling my room? I need to come to XX for work!

Me: Well as I said unfortunately the hotel is closing so we won’t be able to accommodate you. All hotels in the city will be closed.

Guest: Well I guess that’s fine then but can I just ask you one thing?

Me (thinking): Here we go...

Guest: I was in your bar the other day and my friend had a whole tray of drinks dropped on her head. It was incredibly embarrassing. Your Bar Manager whose name I will remember said that the next time we come in, he would give me a free bottle of Champagne on the house. So what’s going to happen with that?

Me: Well at this point the hotel is closed and we don’t know when or even if the hotel is going to reopen so... [At this point I managed to stop myself from saying “I really couldn’t care less”]

Guest: [Rudely] I guess that’s that then.

Me: Yep

I’ve never been great at holding my tongue when guests get aggy at me (I would never have made a good receptionist).

"...I'm looking for another job - NOT in hospitality!

I work in a hotel and we manage the RV Park that is next to us.  

I got a call from one of our long term RV residents concerning a fight in the space next to them.   Two guys - one had a baseball bat, the other a knife.   She asked me to call 911.  (No clue as to why she didn't call them herself, but whatever, I'll call).

Cops arrive, chase the parties involved, catch one of them.  (The others took off in a car that we didn't have a description for, so they got away.)  After a while, one of the officers comes in and tells me everything is calmed down now, but they can't trespass anyone because we have to evict them first, and for now it is just a civil matter.  (I don't have the authority to evict anyway, that has to come from the GM)

I call my GM at home to fill him in on what happened and he got MAD at me for calling the cops!  He said I should have told the reporting party to call them because it doesn't concern us!  WHAT THE FUCK?  He then proceeded to tell me he would not evict the knife wielding jerk since he hasn't caused any problems for us, but I need to call him and tell him that was his only chance - if he messes up again or causes any more problems (you mean like the problem you just said he hasn't caused?), we will evict him.

I told the bookkeeper about it and she said NO, you are not going to call him.  GM can talk to him on Monday.  

After everything settled down, the reporting parties came to the lobby and filed a formal complaint about the fighters, so I have no idea how he plans to handle that.

"I had one of my extended stay guests fuss at me today because, while in the middle of cleaning and sanitizing my bathhouse, he tried to walk in and use it and was asked to leave. Because Mr Must Pee Now couldnt use the bathroom, he felt that now was a good time to tell me he felt like the staff had all been hostile since he checked in... after he's only dealt with me.
When he arrived he felt like we were unwelcoming (when literally all I did was explain rules and answer questions), that being called after he didnt show up on his arrival date felt like we were scolding him (I had to make sure he was still coming so we knew not to rent the spot), and that everyone seemed low grade hostile (which he had no examples of when asked about it).
First of all, he's only upset because I kicked him out. I don't understand why completely open bathroom doors and cleaning bottles on the counters scream ""please come in"", but whatever. He never called us to let us know he'd be a few days late, and normally that automatically means you lose the spot. With all this virus stuff going on, we're trying to work with people as much as possible. And this man is upset because I went over the rules with him??? And hes never spoken to anyone else on staff!! 

I am appalled by the audacity, truly. We just sent out a letter earlier this week detailing new policies in response to the virus, *and it was specifically included not to disrupt staff while cleaning and sanitizing.* My husband and I are busting our asses as the only staff to keep these places clean for people.

And at that moment I just turned around and sat down in the back office making a mental note to 1. Not talk to that guest ever again, and 2. Don't ask ANYONE ""How they are doing?"" (until this coronavirus stuff is over)We were having a moment and you ruined it..",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"

1. Do not complain about the free breakfast not being what it used to be, not our fault we can not have the buffet style right now.
2. Please do not be rude to the little bit of staff we have left just because your room did not get room service. News flash there is a pandemic going on we can not just keep going into everyone's rooms all week.
3. Do not complain that the pool has to be closed, atleast we are still open.
4. Do not pick fun at the staff who have to wear masks now to deal with anyone is still choosing to travel.
5. 9 times out of 10 you traveled from afar to come stay with us, please stay in your room, the staff is not there to be your social entertainment.
6. Do not act like everyone is ridiculous for worrying about the virus as you stand across the counter saying ""oh I'm not worried"", clearly we can see that since you still chose to travel here, but we do not need to be made fun of for worrying about our own lives and those we love. We have to be here, checking in people from all over the country daily, it's not a choice.
7. Don't ask if that is a ""rona pen"" you are about to sign with, we do keep our frontdesk clean. Hint: you could bring your own pen.
8. Wash your hands, apparently according to valuable resources (windows on the doors) some of you are still not doing so.
9. Cover your mouth, some of you are sick and can not hide it, do not infect others.
10. Leave a tip, just like you give a waiter a tip for taking care of you and cleaning up after you, we have to clean way more. And durning this time it is even harder on us.To the people still choosing to travel and are staying at the hotel I work at....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Not even a few minutes ago, I'm sitting in my back area preparing my bags for breakfast when suddenly the door is pushed open as in walks Mr. Pushy. Already reaching into his wallet with his card and ID I do the usual spiel, quoting room types and price.

&amp;#x200B;

P: Yeah, the last time I was here it was (different price).

&amp;#x200B;

Me: That sounds like our usual rate, before taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

P: No, this was flat.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask to see his ID when he tells me he stayed here recently. I look him up and 'lo and behold, he has stayed here recently. Apparently he was given a discounted rate that I couldn't apply because it required a manager code. I explained the situation to him, but apparently that wasn't good enough for him.

&amp;#x200B;

P: Look, I understand you're hurting for business especially with all the virus stuff going around. I came to you guys because you're closer to me, but I could just as easily go somewhere else instead if you can't give me (discounted rate).

&amp;#x200B;

I take a moment to look at the information and the computer before I hand him back his ID and card.

&amp;#x200B;

M: I understand sir.

Mr. Pushy gets into a huff and walks out the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I get it - we're hurting, not coming up with the same number of guests and we could definitely use business. But if you take that kind of attitude with me, I will definitely let the door hit you on the way out. I don't care how hard up we are, we don't need YOUR business. Sir. Now I'm all pissed off from the attitude that I'm knocking out all the work I normally put off till the end to give me something to be productive towards. If he comes back again during my shift I'm going to tell him he's no longer welcome on our property. Anyway this is just my short rant for the evening.

"I’ve always loved the front desk portion of my career the most, and here I am again.  But for obvious reasons this time around it’s been a mental and emotional rollercoaster.

The hardest part of my work day right now is updating our forecasting tool.  We’ve been asked by my company to update it daily with OTB numbers, and I haven’t had a day in two weeks solid where I’ve had any gain for the next three months.  While I’m not in denial that it’s going to be a long road to recovery, it hits the message home daily that I won’t be able to bring my team back any time soon.  I miss our regular guests, my team, and the chaos of a normal hotel day.  

Just needed to vent.  I hope everyone is staying safe, and sane.Hotel GM currently working the desk FT",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My husband runs a motel. We live in the apartment right behind the front desk office. I get to listen in on extreme Karen conversations; this is a privately owned, two-star budget motel in a small town, with literally TWO employees, thanks to the world's current situation, (husband and head housekeeper) who both live on site and work 24/7. The place is old, there are worn-in stains, but it is always clean and sanitary. Our housekeeper is immunocompromised, so they keep things SQUEAKY clean. For their own safety and for the sake of the guests.

A Karen left this morning. Officially my least favorite customer of all time now. 

Before she checked out, she came to the desk and handed my husband a two-page letter berating them on their performance, complete with an itemized list of ""issues"" on the back. (Image of letter linked in comments.)

She also asked for an application, and left her number. 

For the record, she and her husband were treated with absolute respect during their stay, despite the abuse they subtly slipped staff whenever interacting. Their rooms were checked and found to be clean; her complaints were about typical wear and tear around the property. Could we use some updates in our buildings? Sure. But are they acceptable/have they passed annual inspection as-is? YES. They paid under $70 per night for one of our better rooms. Her complaints were entirely invalid, all across the board. 

Good luck finding employment elsewhere, dear. Your apparently extensive experience in ""the industry"" should do you some good, so long as you can keep that personality of yours in check.No, Karen. That's not how you gain employment.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My last post was a little negative so I thought I'd share an uplifting story of how I went against my better professional judgement with a guest. 

It was an hour before my PM shift ended and had only been employed for about 5ish months. No issues or the like, but I was new and a bit arrogant by my competency so wasn't really worried about getting fired. 

MotelTonight res came in and the front had been dead for about 2 hours. Comes in this young looking guy, super tall and eyes red. I ask how he's doing and let him know that the reservation he made hasn't popped up in our system. He tells me he had a bad fight with his GF and left for a few days to let things settle. Since it'd be awkward to let the silence take over the conversation I asked what he did and we both had similar interests \[programming\]. He lit up albeit still teary eyed and he seemed to be in a better mood before he was reminded by the fight with his GF. 

To put into context. I had been looking at hotel/hospitality memes for the last hour and against my better judgement decided to ask if he'd like to see a funny photo. He agrees and while I am looking it up realize it may be a bit 'too soon' for his situation, but I showed him anyway. The picture itself was by Leigh Rubinl, you can find it on google images if you type 'st, rubes extended stay' and should come up as the first few pictures. 

When I showed him it he paused to read and began to look as if he was crying before bursting out in laughter with tears rolling down his eyes. He thanked me a lot that before heading to his room. In hindsight that could have ended real badly if he took it the wrong way, but was glad he got the joke. He was with us the next couple weeks and always happy to see me then after filling me in on how he's doing and so forth.From Tears of Sadness to Tears of Joy",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I no longer work in hospitality, but wanted to share this little story about a group of guests we had staying with us that were part of a larger group and the very rude/mean main contact staying with us. 

The group worked with local business to ensure safety. I don't know where exactly they were, but it essentially equated to on-site security. The corporate putting them up there were very kind and patient with making the reservations and each guest ended coming at different times with some being early. Luckily we had the rooms, but due to the virus our rates were dropping and we didn't get the best guests coming in. The group in-house didn't seem to mind and aside from being a little abrasive at times were fine to work with. We even let them have a few liberties with cooking on property that we normally wouldn't let other guests do. 

However, the main contact was less than polite and came off as a general sourpuss (you know what word I mean). Over the period of a couple weeks he'd take two parking spaces, act annoyed when we let him know a package arrived and was ready for pick-up at front desk and when we fulfilled smaller requests. I honestly thought he was some construction worker by his out of shape size, attitude and truck he drove. During the time he was with us we got no calls or emails about complaints.

However, one fateful day when I began my shift he came in angry and demanded why we charged his card (the amount was a little less than you'd spend ordering a small pizza delivered. This was less than what I made in an hour). Morning shift didn't let me know, so I combed through the notes and emails. Even called up AM shift to ask. Once I got the picture I told the guest that he had damaged some towels and by the looks of it were too dirty for us to clean. As he was the most omnipotent brat in the world he said, ""Well aren't towels supposed to be used for that?!""

Me: -pausing. I understand the logic, but he doesn't understand how stained they are- ""I understand, but the way these look we can't reuse them since--""

Guest: ""Where's your manager...""

\-I get the manager in back and notify her of the situation. I still have the photos and guest info on screen so she isn't looking around-

I can't remember the conversation exactly, but what essentially happened was my GM trying to explain to the guest that although towels are used to clean up, the type of dirt and grime on them was excessive which is why we charged. The guest not only kept asking my boss the same question and interrupting her when she tried to talk and explain, but then went on to say that he was law enforcement working 12 hours a day and that him and his team have had nothing but problems since they arrived. When my GM tried to explain we were available to assist if any issues occurred he interrupted her again saying if she didn't refund his money he'd leave with all his guys. My GM was going to refund him regardless since he was making such a big stink about it. He left angrier than before and she wanted me to make sure we took care of them for any issues. 

Later that day I get a call from their corporate office saying the group would be leaving tomorrow morning and apologizes for the inconvenience we had with the group. Come that very same night and one  of the guys from the group is anxious since he had a real sensitive document coming in. I let him know we'd call him asap once he got it and was more than satisfied. 

Now here is the kicker to all of this. The next day when I talked to my GM about how their checkout went she told me it was all fine... but... when they went into that angry guest's room from the day before he had dumped all his half eaten food, waste and garbage into the tub. I WAS SHOCKED AND ANGRY! My GM nearly called the corp office that put them there but decided against it to avoid any further trouble. I looked up the guy's name on google and turns out he's not LEO, nor ex-military. Just some guy who used to work min wage security before starting a security consulting company. 

When I used to work security, the meanest people on our team were those who had no LEO or military experience, rather, just got locked into min wage security because they didn't do anything else with their lives until maybe their 30s. I don't know the guy personally and I wish his business success, but it's only a matter of time until someone doesn't take his flak and gas-lighting him on social media or to the people that hire his company. Any CEO worth their salt, especially a small business, knows better than to risk their livelihood over something so petty as less than min wage charge.Kind Group - Mean Contact",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Working at a side of the highway hotel with cheap rates within 20 miles of a major population center, you’re bound to see some riff-raff, some rough customers, and some rolling stones passing through here and there. Now, of course, most of the time you’ll wind up with pleasant folks who either travel for a living or otherwise just have some common  decency and understanding, but in my experience, it is the off-color people that stick in your mind. Today I tell the story of a man who was both. He was charming upon arrival, but had all the grace and nicety of a [CHUD](https://www.writeups.org/chud-movie/) when he re-arrived as a stayover (not really a typical “stayover,” because he didn’t stay in the same room). 

Our story begins, I am young and working long weeks at a less than luxurious property, but decent enough to have a well-trained staff. It was off the highway, so it was pretty much made to accommodate the a nearby growing metropolis. I am working evening shift (3-10pm), which sucks because it is when people are checking in and most of the problems that will come up will come up during this shift (whether they don’t have the right kind of payment, they find hair in the bed, what have you). A man arrives at the beginning of the shift to check in early, I will call this man Momo (on the count of he was a Momo/chowder-head).

How should I describe Momo upon this first encounter? He was casually dressed, and seemed a casual man. Average height and build, tattered ball-cap and a soft demeanor. He seemed like a dad. He had an aged face for forty — the kind that looks like he’s been smoking cigarettes since he was 8 years old. Momo had a top tier membership in our rewards program, but acted like someone who didn’t even have one, no hoity toity bullshit at all. He paid with a card and didn’t give me any greif about having to wait for a while for me to log in (as he came during the shift change). Basically, he was the best kind of check in.

Fast forward to the following evening. The housekeepers had a lot of checkouts, so they were still cleaning rooms when I got there. The inspector for some of the floors comes and lets me know that I just need to put a room out of order because a guest soiled the bed and they needed to change the mattress topper. I couldn’t believe it when I checked the reservation and saw that it was Momo’s reservation. Literally shocked. I brush it off and get a little bit further into the shift, I chance to notice Momo is also on the arrivals list. Fuck! O.K. 

I decide to talk to my Manager and he gets a belly laugh out of the situation, he said that we can’t charge him or deny him a room because of what could have been a legitimate medical accident. Fair enough, but a 40ish year old man with no kids or pers with him happening to be incontinent is a little out there (it was shit btw, not urine). RELIEF, I notice that his card is wouldn’t preauthorize for $1.00 which we run then release to validate cards on file. His phone number on file did not work either. We were close to selling out, so I figured maybe, just maybe, I could delete his reservation and turn him away later. But the manager told me to give him more time because of his membership tier.

30 (~) minutes later, Momo re-enters. Has the same pleasant attitude despite having shat a bed in the building the night before. Now all of his endearing qualities just seemed wrong. But of course I meet him with obligatory glib...

Me - “Hello, welcome back Mr Momo.”

Momo - “Hello again, I’ll tell you I absolutely love this place...“ (so on so forth).

Me - “Hey, so I tried to give you a call earlier, the card on file seems to have expired or something, it wouldn’t go through.”

Momo (having a confused frown) - “Declined? What? No, I know there is money on there. I just loaded it on there this morning.”

I try to run it again, I try to run it for just the room and tax and not incidentals, I try to run it for $1.00. Nothing works.

Me - “I’m sorry sir, but it’s still not going through. Do you have another card you could put it on? Could you call the bank.”

He has no other money and opts to call the bank. For the next THREE HOURS he lingers on hold and on the phone with people from his bank, in my goddamn lobby.

He is getting testy with them, and seems to be trying to maintain some kind of pride to me. It’s kind of funny because a few times he got on the phone with people and then he would come up and all matter-of-fact put them on speaker to back up his claims (like dude, I literally don’t give a fuck, I just work here, my job right now is just to break the news that no money = no room). 

At this point we were sold out, so canceling his room could free up more space to sell another room with a little less of a shakey situations, and I get a sick satisfaction out of asking people to seek accommodations elsewhere, so I asked the manager if I could cancel the reservation. He says that because of his tier and the fact that he is here and trying to secure payment, I can’t cancel it. YAY.

This macabre charade continues for-fucking-ever and a day. I remember I prepared to to tell next shift about the situation because I thought I was going to have to leave with this jokester piddlefarting in the lobby (given that this man came in at 5 o’clock, that is a fucking long time). Finally just like 30 mins before the shift swap, he secures the payment. And I get him checked in. JBFC.

This next part is the real kicker:

I don’t know if this Jekyll-and-Hyde pudding-head was playing some kind of sick joke on me, but just as I am telling the auditor the crazy shit this man did and closing my shift out, like the devil, Momo appears at my shoulder. 

Momo - “How much for a coke and gummy worms?” 

Me - “$6.00 total, would you like that put on the room?” (Yes that price is accurate)

Momo - “No, I want to put it on a different card.”

A DiFerEnT cARd yoU SaY? Oh okay. He pulls out his bank card, different from the one on file. Turns out, he just didn’t want to use to use his bank card. That was worth 6 hours of the most uncomfortable lobby of all time. Fin. I don’t know what the fuck else to say. Like I said, I have seen some oddballs in the hotel business, but jee if Momo wasn’t something special.“Declined? What? No, I know there is money on there.” The worst stayover guest of all time.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"FD Agent in Maine, here. Our current guests are construction workers who have been staying with us since last October, Canadians on their way home due to the return home order from their Prime Minister, Doctors and medical workers sleepwalking in at midnight for 4 hours sleep before heading back to the hospital, and a couple members of our own staff who have quarantined themselves to our hotel due to having roommates back home and wanting to keep their jobs, so they stay here to stop the spread and reduce the risk.  
  
These types of guests I can understand.  
  
The guests that really make me angry are the locals. We have been issued a 'stay at home' order here that begins tomorrow. During all of this pandemic crap, I have had SO MANY local people come and book a room and admit that its because they are stir crazy and need to get out of their houses. Most of them have kids. They get upset when I have to tell them that the pool/breakfast/gym/EVERYTHING is closed down. So basically, they took their kids from home and put them in literally the same situation. It has really been making me mad. Am I overreacting? lol 
  
I think that starting tomorrow, if I have any locals come in and they don't have a seriously legitimate reason for staying here, I'm probably not going to be able to hide my face.

"Been sitting on this Tale for a while, and I think the time is right.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of April, and the fools that might be found within.

It may come as a surprise to some of you that your humble narrator is not 100% serious all the time. I might even be described as 'whimsical', 'fun-loving', or even 'silly' on many occasions.

I am, in short, an enormous goofball.

Don't get me wrong, I can do 'professional' just fine. Heck, I can put on a suit and tie and be the most professional professional who ever professed a profession. But I'm far more adept with casual humor and jokes.

My old manager was a bit more tolerant of this than my current one. I was allowed to wear my pirate costume for Talk Like A Pirate Day, for example. (""Arr, the dread pirate SkrvyTail!""). This leniency also applied to April Fool's Day. So long as the whimsical tomfoolery didn't interfere with the operation of the hotel or offend the guests, I could have some fun.

And thus, fun was had.

It's slow tonight (good gravy is it ever), so I will now take this opportunity to expound upon the nature of what makes a good April Fool's gag.

First, it must never be done with ill intent. A good gag is a *gift*, a moment of silliness that is *shared*, not *inflicted*. Someone is the 'recipient' of a gag, not a 'target' or 'victim'.

Second, with that in mind, the gag should be one that is appreciated by the recipient as well. If they're not laughing but you are, it's a cruel prank and you're not being nice. This goes quadruple for the 'shock' gags - ""Oh no, your mom had a heart attack - just kidding, April Fool's!"" is NOT okay.

Third, you should be mindful that things may go awry. Don't involve animals, fire, or sharp objects that might have someone calling emergency services. Especially do not combine them.

Fourth and final, reversibility. Your gag should be easily undone once the laugh is had. If there's a mess, you should be there to help clean it up. This goes double in a work setting where your boss may not appreciate the humor inherent in, say, filling a cubicle full of broccoli.

So with those guidelines, I performed the following feats of bemusement: Reordered the folio bucket back to front. Slipped some 'Bunnies and Kittens' stationary into the printer. Hid no fewer than thirty little rubber duckies around the office area. Hid a ThinkGeek Annoy-O-Tron* in different places three years in a row. Clown wig. Refilled the staplers with different colored staples.

And so it was that one year, I dressed for the occasion. A brightly colored patchwork vest, and a Jester's cap, complete with the bells. I stopped short of the full Renfaire getup, but only just. Guests thought it hilarious of course.

Unfortunately, being the night shift, I had missed the very important note that had been left by the manager: Corporate inspection time. 

Oops.

Now, this was an *especially* bad time for this to happen. Holy Crap Inn was trimming a lot of it's smaller properties, and we were fighting to keep our branding. These guys were basically looking for any excuse at all to drop us.

Thankfully, they were insufficiently impressed with the rest of the hotel that the line 'Front Desk Agent Not In Proper Attire' didn't register with the owners, or there might have been issues.

Sadly, my current manager is considerably less tolerant of silliness. My Annoy-O-Tron was given back in a bag, broken in three pieces.  A lesser man might have snuck a rubber tarantula into his desk, but I will persevere. I limit myself to wearing my nametag upside down.

Teal Deer; Lo, for I dress'd as unto a Fool, and was shown to be Foolish in doing so.

"Hello everyone, before I start with today's story, I would like to describe myself a little bit, as all of the details I am about to share are prudent to this story. So I have worked in hotels for only 6 years, but my mom has been doing it since she was 18, so with that being said, I know the business as I have been around it my whole life. I am a 24 year old, Caucasian, male, that is completely color blind, that's right, only black, white, and more than 50 shades gray for me available on the color spectrum. Those are the only details I will share about me, but like I mentioned earlier, they will come into play. Another note, this story has some strong language hence the NSFW, but I wanted the experience to be as close to what happened as possible. Should you continue reading, don't say I didn't warn you.

Today's story begins with your protagonist minding his own business at the front desk, when the housekeeping supervisor comes up to me and mentions that room X was smoking pot in their room, and left several belongings behind as well. Our policy was we can't charge a room based on smell alone, no matter how bad it is, there had o be evidence, and oh boy was there some. I meant, half smoked blunts and joints all over the place, pot all over the counters, and cigarettes as well. These jokers even had the audacity to put out there smokes on the walls in both the main room, and the bathroom. Needless to say, we charged them the $250 smoking/deep cleaning fee that they agreed to when they signed their reg card. Some of you already know where this is going...

About an hour after I charged the amount (I was shocked it even went through) I received the phone call that I knew was coming. I will now introduce our cast to avoid confusion,

Me (The then 19 year old FDA), DG (Drug Girl), RG (Racist Girl), AG (Angry Guy), M (my Manager)

Me: \*Hotel phone spiel\*

DG: Uh, hi? I just got an alert from my bank that you guys just charged me an extra $250?

Me: Ah yes, I believe you were our guest in room X. We charged you because there was substantial evidence of smoking in the room, which is illegal in this state.

DG: But I never smoked in the room....Whatever, I'm going to stop by and talk to you in person.

As I hang up, M walks around the corner, he's in the back office watching his son, as something unexpected came up and his son had to spend some time with us. I inform him of the situation, and he asks if I want him to handle it, to which I say I can do it. I was known to not really take any shit from people, no matter how in my face they got. Sure enough in walks DG and RG, and both are quite clearly pissed, and I braced myself for the upcoming conversation.

DG: Hey, you that dude I just talked to on the phone that wrongly charged me?

Me: I am the ""dude"" that you just talked to, but I did not wrongly charge you. I have a copy of the form you signed stating that you would not smoke in the room, which you did, and that gives us full permission to charge you the fee. I even have the pictures that were taken from the room so you can see everything we charged you for.

DG: Ok, but you have no right to charge me, I never smoked in the room, all I did was roll it up in there, pot is legal in this state.

Me: First, no it is not, the law is passed, but hasn't been enacted until two months later. Second, we charged the card that was on file, which our reg card clearly states we would do.

RG: No, I see what's really going on here, you're just some cracker that has hate for us women of color, all hail the patriarchy, we just have to do whatever you say, just like when your people treated us as slaves.

Now my mouth was agape, I could not believe she took me charging a fee and related it to literal slavery.

DG: Whatever I'm going to go get my boyfriend and he'll talk to you, I left some shit behind, a blue sweater and black tennis shoes, at least give me those back.

I walk in the back and grab both of the items and bring them back up front, but the girls just stand there staring at the items I brought out.

RG: Wow, on top of being a racist, misogynistic asshole, you must be stupid too. This is a yellow sweater, and blue shoes.

Me: I'm sorry, I am actually colorblind, and there were two sets of each back there, I took a gamble on this being the right one and I was wrong.

I bring them the correct stuff and they stomp out the door. M comes up and says that he's glad I stuck to it, as other team members would have refunded them when it got to that point. I told him I wasn't worried about it, I can handle whatever insult they spew at me, I can take care of the issue. Then walks in our final cast member.

AG: Hey buddy, what gives you the right to charge those two college girls, who already don't have a lot of money to begin with, such an outrageous fee?!

Me: As I mentioned to them, there was clear signs of smoking in the room. I showed them pictures, the no smoking signs, and the form they signed agreeing that they'd follow these rules, or face the charges for not doing so.

AG: I don't care about that, show some compassion, these girls now won't be able to afford their car payment because of this bullshit.

Me: I'm sorry sir, but they really should have thought of that before they smoked in the room. At this point, it is not my problem anymore.

AG: I'm going to give you ten seconds to start reversing these charges you bitch, or we're going to have problems.

At this point, upon hearing a verbal threat, M steps out and takes over.

M: Sir, I am going to ask you to leave the property right now, you will not threaten my employees. So I will give YOU ten seconds, and should you choose to stay, police will be called, and you will be removed from the property.

AG: OH big man, gotta pussy out and call police, can't handle your own problems. You're both bitches, and I hope you both have to watch your family die, and you both die. Once you go, there's a nice hot spot in Hell for the both of ya. Satan is personally going to rape you both for all of eternity.

M: Have a great day sir, please leave.

AG: F you bitches!

He leaves and we don't hear back from them, but both of us check on his son who is crying and visibly shaking. The poor kid heard all of it, and was so scared, and the worst part is, he can see on the cameras right in the back office everything going on too. I told M to take the rest of the day and focus on his son, which he did. I later got a call from the bank, or credit card company, honestly unsure, but they tried to do a charge back. I explained everything to them, and they said they'd be leaving the charges on. I also had corporate call, and had to again explain the situation. They were banned from the whole chain, so another plus.

"Hello everyone! This is a tale from well before the pandemic, I just never got around to posting it.  


So, my hotel does not offer complimentary breakfast. At all. We don't have a buffet style, except for certain groups that we have contracts with. Otherwise, we have a small cafe/ restaurant that serves coffee, pastries, and full meals, which is where I work. Now, the restaurant is a bit overpriced. It's ten dollars for a breakfast sandwich and a small fruit bowl. I get that it sucks.  


What I don't get is people who care so much about us not having free breakfast that they complain and whine about it, but can't be bothered to check if complimentary breakfast is offered before making their stay. I happen to like having continental breakfast, so whenever I stay at a hotel, I \*gasp\* check if the hotel offers before making my reservation. I can't imagine being a mother of five young kids and just assuming the hotel offers free breakfast- but that happens all the time at my hotel.  


Anyways. That's just a bit of a rant. Most people understand when I tell them no free breakfast and either choose from our menu or politely say they'll eat somewhere else. Some people act like it's my fault, personally.  


One particular guy came up and started asking about free breakfast. I explained it wasn't offered, and that the (empty) buffet tables were only for a certain group, which he wasn't a part of (we give vouchers to these groups, and they know what breakfast is like). I handed him the menu and explained his options. This man started to get irritated and complained about the prices. I said ""I understand, sir"" and he shot back ""No, you really don't"" Before walking away.  


When I tell you that I am still shocked and frankly offended by that statement. I'm not rolling in the dough, I understand the way that unexpected costs can throw a wrench into your vacation. But you know what I don't understand? Being rude to a server trying to be sympathetic. You know what else I don't understand? Not checking to see if a hotel has free breakfast before making the res.   


I know this isn't a big deal and I've had much worse guests. But that statement was so flippant and so dismissive of me as a person that it stuck with me.""No, you really don't understand"" AKA workers are robots",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"If you or your staff have not been trained on computer security, then please consider doing so. 

We all know the popular ""get connected to a room and pretend to be hotel staff"" scam, but I encountered a new one yesterday.

At around 7:30pm I get a call from someone claiming to be brand tech support. They basically said they needed to do a routine reset on the computer and they needed access to the front desk email so they could ""send a link to reinstall all the programs on the computer."" They asked for the email, the email password, and if there was a two factor verification for it. 

Luckily I am pretty familiar with computers and just gave the guy on the phone a fake email and password and sent him on his way. Nice try dipshit, but:
1. we wouldn't do ""routine reset"" at 7PM when guests are trying to check in
2. A reset wouldn't happen without me knowing about it (I'm basically the unofficial IT person at the hotel)
3. You dont need access to an email to remote connect to my computer

I hate to think what would have happened if my tech illiterate GM had gotten the call instead. The guy on the phone was very convincing and someone who did not know better would have compromised the email and opened any files sent to it, potentially compromising the whole system.I let everyone know what happened and I went ahead and purged the email just in case. 

I have always been a big proponent of computer literacy for my staff, not only so they can fix small computer issues themselves but also because so much guest information is just a username and password away.

With one of the big brands having experienced a second data breach with the use of front desk credentials, it is more important than ever for employees to protect themselves and guests.A scam to look out for concerning computer security",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This walk-in experience keeps haunting me.
So, exorcising the demons here.

Family of four is looking for a room. Mother, Father and two daughters about my age (20s).
It's late. My hotel is directly in an airport. The prices are sky high. Most people are only sleeping a couple hours before a flight.

When people hear the price, I'm used to either having people haggle while berating me about their membership status, just walking away, calling me a thief or shaking their heads and laughing before saying 'thanks' and walking away.

The wife says something like ""oh my lord"" . Daughters look a little taken aback. Wife talks to husband and he begins shaking his head. He looks at me and shakes his head while smiling. They're declining, but not being rude. So, I decide to fill them in on the cheaper hotels nearby with free shuttles from the airport. While I laugh along a little with the dad incredulously shaking his head.

In the middle of my dialogue, I notice the wife is handing me a credit card. Ok. Create reservation. Scan the card. Decline. Crap. Husband digs for his credit card. Smiling and shaking his head. Ok, the situation is not that funny anymore, but hey he's nice and my tired ass decides to give him a sort of ""I know"" laugh (laughing along stupidly is my go-to for trying to be friendly). He hands over the card.
I notice his hand is also wildly shaking, just as his head is continuing to do. Fuuuck.

My dumbass forgets the name of the disability at the moment, but suffice it to say, none of his shaking was voluntary. Finally look at his daughters and they look unamused. At this point, I just keep my dumbass head down and finish the reservation, rattle off the amenities and processes lightning quick and bid them goodnight. 

Good God, I must've looked like an asshole.

"It was St. Patrick's Day that my state put into effect the mandate to close bars and other facilities, so similar to many of you, our hotel had to close our lobby bar, limit breakfast items, and close common areas such as the pool, fitness center, etc.

We have a guest in house for three nights.  First night he checks in, I explain to him about how we are doing breakfast and that our facilities are closed, blah blah blah I can tell that he isn't even listening.

The very next day he comes down into the lobby during my shift with his buddy.  Let's call him DB for douche bag.

DB: ""Why are alllll the baaarrrrrss cllooooooosssseeeedddd?  Why isn't the pool open??""

He's over six feet away and I can smell the booze on him as he keeps getting closer and closer.  Him and his buddy both have beers in hand.  I scoot back to make as much distance as possible between us.

ME: ""The Governor issued a state wide mandate a few days ago in response to the virus going around.  All bars had to shut down and hotels had to close public areas.  I think there's a few places in town though that you can order take-out from.""

DB: ""Well we just want to use the pool table.  Why won't you let us in?""  (The pool table is in the pool room downstairs.)

ME: ""I'm sorry, but all public areas are closed.  It's not my choice.""

DB: ""So what would you do if we broke into the pool then?""

ME: ""I would call the police.""  I didn't even hesitate, I hate dealing with drunk entitled idiots.

DB: ""Well don't do that! You didn't have to take it so far! We didn't even do anything!""

ME: ""I'm not calling the police, I only would if you broke into the pool area.  That would be destruction of property and violating the state mandate.""

DB: ""Fine, we will just go back to the room I guess.""

So now it's been about a week since I worked last since I got my hours cut and my manager leaves recent reviews printed out on the desk so we can all read them and initial that we know what's up.

So DB left a review:

""OUR STAY SUCKED! Everything was closed! No pool, No breakfast, nothing!  The girl working the desk threatened to call the cops cause we asked to use the pool table.  Crap service on her part.  WILL NOT BE BACK!""

My manger's response did mention the state mandate and said she would ask her FDA why the conversation escalated.  At least she seems to realize already that this guy was clearly being a DB and didn't even ask me what happened.  It's crazy how some people make it so far into adulthood while being so ignorant.OUR STAY SUCKED!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Ok, so first of all, I don't work at a hotel/motel/hositle. I work mostly medical assistant and sometimes front desk at a medical office. Nonetheless, I feel some of your pain as far as dealing with guests. Only my guests are patients. And just the same, I get the weirdest/dumbest questions or responses. I feel like I have to share with you all to make you guys laugh, because this is ridiculous most days. Today are just two of the dumber ones I've had lately:

Dumb response number one - I get a call from our call team stating a patient is mad she missed her appointment. She was rude to the call team and they can't talk to her. So I volunteer. I'm used to dealing with rude people, but maybe it's a misunderstanding and I can figure it out. Our call team is also in the Phillipines and most patients seem to want to be rude to them no matter what, which sets my temper off as it is because they don't deserve that. All they are trying to do is help you. (Side note: the excuse of ""I can't understand them"" is BS; they all speak great English and not one is hard to understand - I've understood them perfectly since day one and I'm convinced people ""can't understand them"" because they don't try and automatically shut down when they hear a foreign accent). So I call this patient back and try to see why she's upset. She automatically cuts me off before I can say anything. Ok, strike two. Now I'm losing patience (which, to be fair, isn't hard as I'm Puerto Rican/Irish/German). So she rants on about how she's mad she missed her appointment yesterday and no one called her to let her know it was yesterday. So I finally cut her off instead and speak firmly over her annoying voice and state that I was the one who called and left a voicemail on her phone about her appointment and CLEARLY STATED to call us back if she couldn't make it. This now sets her off even more and she starts blaming us for not checking her voicemail. To which I reply: it's not our responsibility to check her voicemail and call her back. I also try to let her know we can get her in in the next couple of days, but she cuts me off again. Once again stating how it's our fault we didn't check her voicemail. This time, I'm much louder when I say it's not our responsibility and I mention she could always call us back after hours and leave a message to reschedule. It could be any time and we would've taken care of it. Nope. She didn't want to hear it. She starts yelling about wanting to talk to a supervisor (me) and I almost die laughing when I tell her that's me (yes, I held back my laugh; no I wasn't rude - in fact, I'm surprised by how calm I was this entire time). Finally, after the 5th or 6th ""...it was your fault I didn't check my voicemail..."", I let her know to call the call team back if you wanted to speak to their supervisor (who's a great friend and honestly, much more brutal than I can be) and they will take care of her. I also cut her off in the middle of her rant and told her to have a great day and hung up on her because she was starting to screech at this point.

Dumb response number two (less than an hour later): a patient comes to check in and I need her new ID card (can't get prescribed opioids without a valid ID - state law). She says no biggie, I'll run out to the car to grab the new one. Cool. Then she stands at the counter staring... Ok, awkward, can I help you? Her response, ""Why is there so much shit outside?!"" So me, not trying to shout the first sarcastic thing that just came to mind, asks what she's talking about. She says duck shit... Side story - we have geese that hang out in the parking lot and are a bit aggressive. Yes, they shit. Yes it's all over the parking lot and side walk. No, there's nothing we can do about it... So she asks me again why it's not cleaned up. And then the dumb response RIGHT AFTER - ""Why don't you guys stop them?!"" Mind you, she's practically paniked about the whole thing and damn near yelling lol Guys, I'm ashamed to say, I couldn't help myself. My response: ""I can't control geese shitting whenever they want nor can I tell them to stop."" I get a blank stare for a few more awkward seconds, then she just goes out to get her ID and that was that. Pleasant patient and nice lady. The rest of the time she and I just talked pleasantries and how we are both doing with the COVID-19 thing. 

So, I can say, I feel some of your guys' pain as far as dealing with some weird/dumb things from people. I'm sorry you guys have to deal with it as well, but so glad you're all staying safe throughout this whole mess.The weirdest/dumbest questions",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello everyone, after looking over my stories, I realized I never told you all of my rookie experience in the hotel world, that really just kicked off the whole chain of just, well, weirdness that is our industry. This is quite literally was my first hotel that I had worked at when this happened, mind you, my mom had been in the industry my whole life, so I had heard stories. Sadly, hearing is different from having happen to you, which I unfortunately had to figure out on this fateful day.

There is a cast for this one, and that would be; Me (the empty husk of a person), Bartender (B), Guest (G)

So, as I am standing at the front desk with a coworker, I look across the lobby at the bar and see that it is extremely busy, and at this place, the bartender also ran the room orders. I get a call from the bartender,

B: Hey, Young Jew, I have a room service and was hoping you could bring it to room XXX, as you can see, I'm pretty busy here, and I really don't want to leave the bar.

Me: Sure thing, we're dead over here anyways.

I head over, and I grab the cart, get the check and walk my merry ass over to the room. I knock on the door with the typical room service announcement. No response. I knock again, still no response. I check the check (that's worded weirdly) to make sure I'm at the right room, and sure enough I am. I'm about to head back so we can call them, when I hear the door start opening. From behind said swinging door was a completely naked, looked to be methed out, middle aged white woman. I avert my eyes, and the conversation goes as follows,

Me: (through stuttering at the eyesore I just witnessed) Here is your room service order ma'am.

G: Oh....you're not the lady bartender....

She then as slowly as possible, gets behind the door.

G: Can you place the tray and check right there o the counter?

Me: Yeah.

I place it, and leave, and the lady closes the door. I stand there for about 3-5 minutes, wondering how long it takes to simply sign a check, when I hear them eating in the room. I knock again, and state that I need the check. Again, I'm still new, so I know there were different ways to handle of this, but at the time, I had no idea what they were lol. The guest swings the door open, and once again, I am met with the same sight as before.

G: Sorry honey, I forgot to give this back to ya.

I grab the check and hightail it back to the bar. The whole experience roughly only 10-12 minutes, but the scars are eternal. I get back to the bartender,

Me: OMG, you owe me soooooo much for what just happened there.

B: Oh yeah? Did the naked guy answer the door again?

Me: Naked guy? No, I had a strung out white chick, what do you mean guy?

B: Oh man that's hilarious! We've brought a couple orders to them, and every time I go down, a big, naked, black guy answers the door. They probably heard a guy this time, and sent her over. I bet they're just looking for some fun.

Me: AND YOU DIDN'T THINK TO WARN ME!?

B: No, because if I did, you wouldn't have taken the order.

I sat there and realized I had been played, and that the bartender had gotten me good. I vowed vengeance and went back to the desk, but I don't think I ever followed through with the vow, as she left a week later or something. Also, before anybody says that it was wrong of her to do so (which it was) I honestly don't mind as it gave me this story to share with you all and other friends.

TL:DR I get suckered into bringing room service to a room that has been answering naked. I then get my first ever case of, Please God bleach my memory.My First Weird Experience",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Very strange of me to post two in one day, and this is technically two stories, so three in one day. I currently have no arrivals, and am just reading everyone's tales, and suddenly ones come back to me. As the title, and opening imply, I have two stories to share with you all, and I hope you enjoy them. One is technically a sexual harassment by a guest, but, I let it go because it wasn't enough to weird me out or anything. The other is a tale from an insufferable supervisor, and coworker combo. Both of these happen at the same property, which also was my first property I worked at.

Tale 1: We have a big group in house, a formal affair mixed with a masquerade. I don't know what it was about, as being a front desk agent, that was just starting I didn't focus on those details very much. There were three of us on duty, with two people behind the desk, and myself in the lobby to direct and walk people to the meeting room the event was taking place in. Everything is going great when these two women walked in, and I had to of course bring them to the room. I was leading the way just having normal conversation, telling jokes, to hear them snickering behind me. I figured it was because of my jokes and didn't think anything of it. I walk back to the lobby, only to find my coworkers just howling with laughter. Not wanting to miss the joke I ask them what's so funny? One says, ""You really don't know?"" to which I reply that I don't. Apparently, while I was escorting the nice women to the event, they both were grabbing at my ass, and fanning their faces, as if to imply I had a good one. One apparently want as far as to pretend to....well, play with my manhood and family jewels through gestures. I wasn't really grossed out or weirded out, but I wasn't laughing. When I left, they had asked my coworkers for my number, which thankfully wasn't given.

&amp;#x200B;

Tale 2: There is a cast which is Me (me), Coworker (C), and Supervisor (S). Something to know about this property is it is a medium sized hotel near the airport. 110 rooms, three floors, and for whatever reason, a shuttle that went everywhere, except the airport...I know, makes no sense right? Anyways, I'm at the desk, and it is a sold out night, with my morning shift having done nothing to prepare the evening shift for it. No reg cards done, nobody routed the way they needed, third parties not charged per our policy, I mean, nothing was done. I was on the schedule with a coworker I did not like, as she would sit down, eat, talk loud, and do virtually nothing, outside of screwing things up, which caused me more work to do. The other was my supervisor that said she knew hoe to do everything, but once again, didn't. She was very self centered, and spoiled, as in, mommy and daddy bought me a 2013 BMW, but I wanted the brand new 2014 one. The worst part was, when they were together, it was impossible to get them to do anything.

So, they're both in the back office, which is right behind me, and the door is closed, but the walls are so thin I can hear everything they're saying crystal clear. I have a line of people in front me, and no, not 3-4, like 9-10 people. They all came at once, so I go in the back and ask if they can come up and help me, which is might with sighing, eye rolling, and no help. I go back up and manage to get through all the people, which when I'd get about halfway through the line, 2-3 more people would show up. The whole process took about two hours by myself which had me popping in back asking for help and getting the same response, but thankfully all of the guests were understanding. I finally have a moment of rest, and I am fuming. I walk in the back and this conversation happens,

Me: Where were you two?! I asked for help about five times, and had a whole line of people that just wouldn't shorten because more kept coming in. You both know 1st shift didn't do anything, and you both just left me there!

C: Oh, we didn't know it was that bad, you should have said so, besides, you're pretty good at your job, so we thought you could handle it.

Me: I normally can, but when I ask for help, it means I need help. I don't want to be met with sighs, groans, and eye rolls.

S: Who are you to tell us what to do? Last time I checked, I was the MOD today, not you, so you need to watch your tone.

Me: Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought that the line of people, paying money to stay here is more important than a conversation about hair, nails, makeup, and shopping!

S: We were talking business, besides, the door was closed, how would you even know what we were talking about anyways?

Me: The walls are thin, I heard every word, and so did the guests, most of them shaking their heads because they saw me there struggling alone, to hear you two talk about pointless s#$%. Honestly, if you two have time to talk about all this, that must mean I'm not needed today. We're obviously not busy if you can just sit in back and talk about nothing. So I'm going home.

S: Fine, but don't be surprised if you don't have a job to come back to-

C: Yeah, you're being super unprofessional right now, and we don't want your attitude here anyways.

Me: You both are ridiculous, and if I don't have a job to come back to, that would be fine with me, because that means I wouldn't have to work with either of you again.

At that, I walked out. Before clocking out, I called the FOM and explained everything that happened. She simply said to clock out and go home because I was 100% correct, they obviously didn't need me. I had the next couple of days off, but from what I heard, things went to hell that night for them, guests were wondering where I went, and not particularly happy with the answers they were being given. They were saying how they fired me, and had a snotty attitude, which anybody in our line of work knows, guests really don't like being treated like they're less than us. I did get a write up, as I did walk out, even though the manager gave me permission, but I didn't care, I started looking elsewhere shortly after.

Hope you all enjoyed, I didn't expect the second one to be as log, but as I'm sure some of you know, as I was telling the story, more details were remembered, and I tend to be pretty long winded.2 for 1",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"In my last story I talked about a young couple and their 3 kids. Last night, the young lady and the kids came to see me at around 10 PM asking me if they could have another room. Nothing was wrong with the room they were currently in, it's just that her boyfriend kicked her and their kids out along with all of her belongings.

In the middle of the night.

That... wasn't right. I couldn't physically go down there to make him open the door, so I offered to call the police. She agreed.

Police came and I watched it go down on one of our cameras. There was a long dispute. 2 cars stayed in my parking lot all night. An officer came to ask me about some things but didn't give me any details.

At midnight, when I was supposed to close down and leave, 2 more cars zipped through my parking lot. About 6 officers came out and ""surrounded"" the room. I freaked out and called my GM and she said she'd come down ASAP and that I could leave when she arrived.

Turned out, the guy kicked his girlfriend (or maybe wife) out along with their 3 kids because... she was coughing. He thought she might have had COVID, so he kicked her out. With the kids. In the middle of the night when it was cold outside. While he stayed in the room cosy and warm.

CPS was called and they took the kids away. My GM, who stayed and watched the whole thing (that continued well into the night), said that they were screaming and crying when the CPS lady took them away from their parents, a sight that broke her heart. But even after that, the parents continued to argue and scream in the room over who got COVID and who paid and who didn't, until my GM threatened to call the police again if they didn't quiet down.

The next morning, when the guest was told to leave, he made a huge scene at the lobby and screaming about how it was precisely my fault that his kids got taken away because I called the police, and that it was my fault that his life has gone to shit, and that I'm responsible for the virus (I'm Asian).

I feel so bad for those kids. None of them were older than 4, and the couple couldn't be any older than 25 with no credit, no housing, no job, and living out of a hotel room. They'll likely never see their kids again.

I know I did the right thing, but man sometimes people surprise me in the worst way imaginable.

"Well hello TaleFromTheDesk! 

This whole COVID-19 business is just screwing with everything! Hours are cut, I'm down to working a second part-time job overnight in a warehouse to help make ends meet during all this nonsense, not to mention almost two-thirds of the hotel staff has been either furloughed or laid off during this whole mess. The doors are still open though! With all the hotels starting to shut down during this craziness due to lack of occupancy, we are getting almost all the flight crews from a single airline (who shall remain nameless) that come into our airport. We took in 59 extra flight crew members last night alone. 

Now these fine people had a tendency to think they're God's gift to us under normal circumstances, but this last week alone has shown that, even during what is essentially a new plague unto mankind, they are better than us and deserve special treatment. Now, our restaurant, pool and fitness center are all closed by order of the mayor of my city. We are still able to serve a very *very* limited breakfast and lunch menu out of our coffee shop, which has gotten around the restrictions by removing all tables and chairs from the area, so as to not allow ""in-house dining."" This coffee shop is locked up at 10PM daily and the keys are handed over to the Front Desk so we can unlock the snack area and refrigerators for anyone who may need/want anything overnight. 

Since our main guests now are entirely made up of flight crews, most of them don't arrive until well after 10PM. What follows are some snippets of interactions I've had with crew members from this last week. 

One night, I open the fridges for a captain so he can get a frozen dinner and some beers. He asks me if we have microwaves in our guest rooms. I tell him that, unfortunately we do not, but there is one here in our coffee shop that's accessible 24 hours a day and GESTURE TO THE MICROWAVE! He sees me do this and walks off with his items. I assumed he would come back after paying for them at the front desk to heat up his frozen dinner. He does not. I get a call maybe 5 minutes later from this captain. He immediately starts yelling at me, saying I deliberately lied to him that there are microwaves in the rooms. I apologize that there was a misunderstanding, and reiterate that the only microwave in the coffee shop. He tells me, verbatim ""I never misunderstand anything! You lied to me!"" 

This goes on for a moment before I go and retrieve his frozen dinner from the 17th floor to return to the gift shop, as he no longer wants it, and is mad that I will not admit to lying to him. Because I did not lie to him! I even offered to nuke it myself and return it to him when it's done, but that would not satisfy him. He says we are supposed to offer food after hours (hence the frozen dinners) and that we are refusing him food and his airline is going to get a call in the morning. I passed this along to my manager so he can head off any potential trouble. 

Another pilot was not satisfied with the offerings in the coffee shop and told me we really need to do *more* for the crews during these times. 

Still *another* pilot was angry that I was not actively tracking his specific flight to know exactly when it landed so that I could have transportation arranged for them. After our shuttle driver leaves at midnight (no more OT until this whole virus thing ends) we are paying for taxis, which have a specific place at the airport to line up and will not accept calls to pick up flight crews at the airport as there's no guarantee anyone will be there. And just to clarify, there was a taxi large enough for both pilots *and* the flight attendants available at the airport when they got down to the transportation level. He was just mad that there wasn't *more than one* taxi waiting for them. 

In a plot twist for this last week, I also had a flight attendant who felt unappreciated by us as I wouldn't give her a bottle of wine *for free* and proceeded to complain to me that no one is appreciated flight attendants during this hard time as we're too busy appreciating doctors and nurses and grocery workers! But flight attendants have it so hard right now and no one thanks them for working still! Maybe it's because your job, much like mine, is not *necessary* during a global pandemic, Karen! We're appreciating the doctors and nurses and first responders and  grocery workers because they're actively saving people's lives and making sure there's food on the shelves so we don't starve to death! 

It's going to be a fun time folks! Stay safe out there!Entitled, Even During a Plague",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, I'm pretty chill with my guests. I'm over nights so basically they only see me when they're drunk or half asleep.  I do a lot of really simple shit individually for each of them. Even if it's just a short convo , sending tylonal and Gatorade to their rooms on those good nights or packing a breakfast for them if they need to leave earlier than normal times . Point is they can count on me to make sure their stay goes as smooth as possible and there are almost no inconveniences.  So my long time guests have each made sure to stop by and check on me tonight. With gifts of hand sanitizer,  lysol, and joints. Typically they share a pizza with me. Or a cigarette outside.

"Hey all, I figured it was time for another story, but this one is just wholesome, and as good of a time as a wake can be, which turns out, can be pretty fun. I will say I worked in Chicago for this one, simply because it has to do with a detail later on, but that's as specific on location that I'll get.

At this location I was known as an Operations Supervisor for two properties, which meant I was Font Desk, F&amp;B, Banquets, Maintenance, and Housekeeping, for both places....I did a lot. I'm setting up the meeting room for a wake that's coming in later, and the person in charge of the group walks up to me. They do the usual which is, thank me for setting up, and thanking the hotel to hold the event, then they hit me with ""Where does the keg go?"" This shocked me because we had a full bar and restaurant, so normally we couldn't let groups bring outside food or beverages, and when we did, there were a lot of hoops to jump through. Normally, there are so many, that people just don't bother with it, and use us to cater as well.

She must have seen my confused look, and said don't worry, they knew about the rules, and already went through them, and after a call to my boss, this was confirmed. I get a huge bin full of ice, and the delivery guy and I manage to get this keg in there comfortably. Now this wake was about 20 people, with most of them able to drink, I think I saw only 1 minor there, and they were young enough I wouldn't worry about carding them if you catch my drift. I'm standing at the bar, doing bartender things, when the woman in charge walks up to me again. She says she didn't expect me to bartend as well, and the usual, jack of all trades joke is made. After some chatting, I learn that the keg was actually the deceased's favorite beer, and that's why they got it, but almost nobody likes it.

This is where the story gets fun, She looks at me and says ""I bet you we can drink that whole keg by the time we have to go"" That was 4 hours away. I legally couldn't bet money since I was working, but it was one of those where nothing is actually wagered so I took her up on it. She makes a big announcement about it saying this verbatim, ""The bartender, OP, and I just made a friendly wager about the state of this keg by the end of the night. I said we'd finish it, he disagrees, lets prove him wrong!"", and I kid you not, they all jumped up and rushed over to me to start getting them the beer from the keg.

Remember how I said they all didn't like it? It very clearly showed, as when they were drinking it, their faces were contorting, and the grunts of displeasure were extremely audible. I will give them credit, they were downing this beer like water, but I also could tell it was a heavy beer, as after the second or third glass, they started slowing down. At about the three hour mark, they've made it about 3/4's of the way through the keg, and the moaning of bellies full of beer were filling the room. Some had tapped out and switched to water, some were nursing glasses that pretty much remained half full. The leader was having NONE of it though, and she stood up and began rallying her family. I don't quite remember what she said sadly, but I do know that it worked, and these people rushed me again with renewed vigor.

By the time they left, I was lifting this keg one handed, and could tell there was about two or three more glasses left. Nobody was taking the challenge though. you could see almost everybody just felt dead, and out of the 20 that started, only about 5 were left. Now, when I say ""almost everybody"" I meant that, the leader once again rose to the challenge, and realized that if this keg was going to be finished, she'd have to do it herself. She gets through 1 glass quickly, the 2nd glass a little slower, and I poured the last into her glass. She was half way through, when I saw an all too familiar look come across her face, seconds before I see her sprint to the bathroom. The keg had won, by only 1/4th of a glass, and she tapped out (punny lol) and admitted defeat. The next day the zombies made their way down for breakfast, where your's truly had to work the back to back.

We all say our hellos, and the ""did you even leave"" comments were flying. The leader comes up to me, and we joke about it, and I mention that she had me worried I'd lose for a second there. After breakfast, while I'm cleaning up and getting ready for lunch, she returns one last time. She wanted to thank me again for helping take everyone's mind off of the loss they just had, and for playing along. She follows up by saying ""I know the bet was all in good fun, but I wanted to give you something for winning, and just being a great employee, and person"" She grabs four boxes of Chicago deep dish pizza (my absolute favorite food in the world) and hands them to me. We do our goodbyes, and I store the pizzas away, while splitting one with the few employees that were there.

Like I said, not as crazy, or wild as the other ones, but I think that's what is needed right now with all this craziness going on. Hopefully y'all are safe, and keeping safe, and again, let me know if you want those other stories.The Wake, and the Keg",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"For those who don’t know, I’m the guest service manager at a chain located in a resort town. I love my job. I love meeting new people and I love the town that I practically grew up in. 

As we should all know by now, the hospitality industry is severely damaged from Covid-19 pandemic. 

Instead of closing doors, my parent company cut salary wages across the board 20% and have corporate office socialites working at actual hotels which some of them haven’t done in 20-30 years. Or ever. There has been no offer of hazard pay or precautions to combat the virus other than sanitation.

I’ve had to let go every hourly associate with the exception of my night auditors and I work 40-48 hours a week for a handful of guests. 

I’ve had a solid ten rooms every night this week in a 92 room building. 

I live in one of the 27 stay at home states with a high volume of cases being reported everyday. 

The state allows essential businesses (like hotels) to operate, limit travel outside of home to only essential shopping for food and supplies and to exercise outdoors while maintaining 6 ft away from others. 

There were three arrivals tonight. When I asked what brought them to town, they had all answered the same thing: I needed to get out of my house. 

One guest had even traveled from a city two and a half hours away with significantly more cases reported just to “get out of my house.” 

I get that you don’t have anything to do or you’re going stir crazy or that basic cable just isn’t your jam, but really? 

I sit here asking myself, why would you want to risk your own safety and the safety of others? Are the restaurants and bars shutting down not a big enough statement? Are all the group gatherings being cancelled not a red flag? Do these people even care? 

I don’t think they do. 

The main argument that I’m anticipating from this is: 

“At least you have a job stop complaining.” 

My counter to this is simple: 
I’d rather not be at risk to be exposed to Covid-19 than take your money 

Would there be a struggle for money to pay bills? Sure. But I’d rather struggle to pay those than pay the significantly more dangerous price of contracting the disease. 

Thoughts? 

Until next time. 
Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay at home.

"I'm not sure what has happened as I seem to have woken up in some strange world, Much like the world I know but different in slight ways.

You see I manage a small rural hotel that under normal circumstances would be teaming with life and the smell of wet mud, old concrete and grease from the vast number of construction workers and truck drivers roaming the halls.

Alas I believe I'm stuck in some weird real life version of the twilight zone.
Where the walls once seamed to almost breath and halls spoke to the night auditors, now only silence and any sound makes you wonder if the place your in has become haunted by the spirits of those that once stayed.
I'm told it has something to do with being essential but don't understand the silence of it all.
If you should find me cowering in an empty housekeeping closet just know I tried my best, and let my wife know I said don't forget to feed the fish.

Sadly I know this is what most of you are going through if not worse, I hope everyone is staying healthy and looking forward to getting this over with.
I have cut my salary in half so as to keep my employees working as the 2-4(regular truckers and a couple of nurses) guests we have a night won't really cut it I have turned everything that isn't essential in our hotel off and that should reduce our utility bills by about 60% so there's some money not spent. Our cash reserves will run out at the end of April beginning of May if we don't figure something out.
The larger hotel in town has ""temporarily"" closed as it was impossible to operate with no business, While the other hotel my size will probably fall soon too. We for now are safe as we have never had to take loans or worry about paying our bills because of contracts we have. 

But as it goes if no one is working no one is staying so we will see how far the money can be stretched.
GOOD LUCK TO ALL and I hope this finds you better than my brain rite nowTo whom ever finds this...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, we're incredibly slow during the Coronavirus Pandemic, but we still can't avoid the crazies.

I come in this morning, count the drawer, and check the stairwell doors (we had a break in recently). Sometime between 7 and 10, which the housekeepers came in, someone managed to sneak into the property, because one of the guests propped open the stairwell door after I checked it.

Intruder decided to lay down and sleep on the floor in the middle of the hallway.

As soon as I'm informed, I go over and inquire where he belongs. After all, it could be a real guest just being stupid while he waits for his laundry or something.

I ask him, what room he's staying in.

&gt; Yeah, we're good.

&gt;&gt; I'm not asking if you're good, I'm asking what room you're staying in.

&gt; It's okay, we're good.

This goes on way to long. The only room number he tells me was 1226 (a room number we don't have) I tell him that if he belongs on the property, he needs to go back to his room.

So, he gets up and goes over to room 115 and starts weakly knocking on the door. Of course, he doesn't have a key.

I'm pretty sure I know where this is going, but I left him to go back to the desk and check. And there was no one in 115.

I go back to him, and he's moved down to 119, hanging out by that door, but not knocking. Probably because he knows there's someone in there, as he can hear them inside.

He just gives me the same line about being ""good with Bella"". Only this time, he's clearly saying Bella.

We don't have anyone named Bella. But he insists that he belongs in room 119, so I knock on the door there and ask the people (workers for my boss on a different property) if this guy belongs with him.

He doesn't. So I sent him packing.

After checking on the stairwell again and giving a warning to the guy that propped it open before, I turned around, and he was gone.

He went out the pool entrance, instead of the lobby. I follow the intruder out there, and sure enough, he's lamely knocking on the outside access to our meeting/storage room, hoping to get let into the building there.

So, I start walking him out. We have to go through the pool area, because I didn't take a key, and he starts trying to take one of the chairs with him. I had to physically take the chair out of his hands!

We get around the building, and he goes to the back fence and starts messing with the lock to the gate. That's permanently locked, but there is a gaping hole in the fence that people tore through to access the building easier. He goes out the hole and starts messing with the gate from the other side.

It's locked on that side, too, buddy.

I tell him again, you need to get off our property.

&gt; I'm trying, but it's locked!

&gt;&gt; Don't worry about that, just go. Either down this alley to the street or out the front, I don't care which!

He finally leaves and I go back to the desk. Everything seems fine. I get housekeeping started and sit back down.

About 15 minutes later, the guy comes back in through the front door and starts acting like nothing's wrong. I stop him again

&gt;&gt; What room do you belong to?

&gt; (With all the confidence in the world) 226.

&gt;&gt; There's nobody in 226.

&gt; Are you sure? 

&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm sure. What's your name?

&gt; Do you need to know? I rented the room last night.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you rent the room yourself, or did someone rent it for you?

&gt; I rented it myself.

&gt;&gt; So, what's your name?

&gt; Will X (he gave me a real name, but obviously I won't reveal.

&gt;&gt; There's no one registered under that name.

&gt; Are you sure?

&gt;&gt; I'm sure.

&gt; But I found the room on (daily homeshare app)...

&gt;&gt; This is a hotel. We don't rent on (daily homeshare app).

I want to say that he realized the error of his ways, but I've had to tell him off afterwards for trying to come on the property again.

I've avoided calling the cops, because so many of our first responders are quarantined in the area, but I just might have to do that.This is a hotel...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Thankfully, she stayed in the car while her husband came into the lobby to do the actual check in.  I could hear her coughing from the parking lot!!  When I looked out the door, he laughed and said ""It's just a cold. She's been to the doctor SIX times THIS WEEK, so she knows it's just a cold.""  Yeah, okay - whatever you say pal.  If my doctor ever said ""It's just a cold"", I'm sure as hell not going back every single day to check, but hey, that's me.  You do you, sweetheart.

To make matters worse, they have their infant with them and the three of them are sharing a bed - even if it is ""just a cold"", why would you subject your baby to that??

I hosed down everything in the lobby as soon as they drove off.  Then to cover up the disinfectant smell, I oversprayed the air freshner, which is cucumber scented.  The lobby smells really nice though - LOL

Then, I made sure to write notes for EVERYONE to take extreme caution when handling anything from that room/person.Typhoid Mary just checked in....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Now, I don't mind doing wake up calls. While all the hotels I've worked at has a phone system that these calls can be punched into, sometimes things break and it's back to pen, paper, and manual labor. Something my coworkers tended to struggle with.

One week the phone that was handled the wake up calls wasn't working. The thing is older than I am so no shocker. As night audit I had the task given to manually call the guests who had requested wake up calls, not a big deal, I didn't even need to ask the day shifts to write down who and what time.

Or so I thought.

One morning I hear the elevator ding open and an older gentleman comes rushing into the lobby. He glares as me and says, ""Well! I see you have nothing better to do than sit on your ass! Why did I not get my wake up call?!""

I'm shocked and just blink for a moment. 

""I had no idea sir. There were no notes le-""

""Whatever! My plane leaves in a half hour! I'm checking out! I need a cab!""

He rushes outside and I'm left at the desk angry for being yelled at, but slowly realizing that it's that time in the morning where Uber, Lyft, and taxis are all busy and he has ZERO chance of making his flight unless I help.

He goes in and out for a few minutes getting more panicky and I am so so tempted to mock, ""Ooooh! I can get you a cab! But, you know, I only sit on my ass all night!""

Good girl in me won. I called a local cab service and they had a cab in the area, yes, they can get him to the airport quickly.

He is pacing back and forth now, sweating and getting more worked up.

""Sir? I got you a cab, they'll be here in a few. Also, I am sorry about there being no wake up call this morning, I truly had no idea.""

Another glare but the pacing stops.

He huffs and puffs waiting for those few minutes but leaves without a word. I did chew out the day shift who was responsible though. Ooooooh! I programmed that call in thouuugh!! 

No, you didn't, and a guest nearly missed his flight and screamed at me over it. The phone clearly states it out of order. 🙄🙄I don't like being yelled at for someone else's screw up",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have returned, this time on...iPad, so not mobile update. With Corona having fun and causing people to cancel their reservations, we got a call that brought up a few memories, so here is the story of the family who also belong in Entitled People. Sorry it’s so long, but background info is needed.

I got a call from someone PCSing in, and while making their reservation, they mentioned they had one dog over the limit we set. At this time, we didn’t have as strict of guidelines as we do now regarding pets, so I told them that I would let my GM know, and got the breed of dogs to make sure that they were not on our restriction list. After checking with the GM and getting approval, we learned from the guest he would be coming with one dog, then the others would come with his wife and kids. I told them that we would need shot and rabies records for all of them as they came in, we were 24/7, and did my best to help.

When the guest came in, he only had tags, but we took them, he signed the agreement (sort of...ignored red flag #1) and then we didn’t hear from them until they had moved a few times due to how many people were in, and were in the room they’d stay with us and wanted to extend. We’d never gotten the other shot records (red flag #2) but the one time we spoke to the wife who came by to extend their stay, she appeared nice and had chatted about dogs and the like.

Then their cards declined.

With military bases, cards declining for extended stay is one of those things that do happen, and we do our best to keep up with it and make sure that the guest gets in touch with whoever they need to so they can pay off the card and we can get the next payment so things can go along. Most military people have a government travel card that they have to pay off, and if they don’t they have to pay out of pocket, then move it back. Same with moving anywhere. However, the cards are not always maintained (some will not go on long work orders for a year or more, and so the card will be frozen due to non-use) or others simply don’t activate them right. Others are waiting to be paid for what they spent so they can pay back the card. When I went on a training trip to San Antonio, I waited nearly two months after returning before I got the payment to pay MY GTC!

It’s after a few times and switching cards that the family starts to minimize contact with us. Between this, I did have one guest check out early, as their dog has been howling and up late and they’d needed that rest time and simply couldn’t stand it. He’d not wanted to press the issue, instead leaving early. We also learned much later that one of their dogs had been a bit dog-aggressive, and attacked another, but the families had ‘sorted it out’. 

I do have to add that for some military base inns, we’re not set up like regular hotels. The TLFs they were in were a good 30 minute drive from where we had the front desk, and though some of the rooms are now more centralized, there are still some that are that far away. So the ones who had more contact with the family were the guests also staying there or the Housekeepers.

As their stay was getting up to well over our 30 day period, we received an e-mail from the Housekeeping Manager, who stated her Housekeeper that went out had a few complaints. One was the fact that the family wasn’t putting away the poop bags for their dogs into where they had to, the other being they were not really being allowed to service the room (we need to do a full service every 3 days or so) and the last being they actually had ANOTHER dog - this one on our breed-restriction list. I called the guest about it and got hold of his wife, who was irritated about it but seemed understanding. She stated she and the kids were there all day, so if we had any questions to give her a call.

A few days later, they dead bolted the door and put up a sign saying THEY were taking care of the cleaning and to not worry.
And all the red flags popped up because of this. We noticed that when we’d checked them in we didn’t have all the records, they hadn’t signed, and all the other stuff that came up. Attempts to call her lead to some issues, but despite being “in house all the time”, the phone in the room was never picked up.

So things escalated up to the man’s supervisor, at which point the wife called, UPSET that we had involved the supervisor when “he didn’t live there, he doesn’t know what’s going on.” Yeah, understood lady, but you also never answers any of the phone calls our GM made, and never answer the room phone even though you or your kids are ‘always there’.

I dealt with her again after she and her husband were told they had to bring in the shot and rabies records. They had given us a song and dance about how it was hard to get the paperwork from their last duty station, which was still in the US and only a time zone or two away, but somehow they couldn’t fax it to us.

It’s about two hours after she said she’ll bring in the paperwork that she brings it in, huffy and annoyed at me. Now, normally I’m very friendly, and try to be a good representative of the front desk. I have only ever looked upset at one man, who deserved it for being a skeevy guy, and another who offered a coworker something that totally sounded like her becoming his live-in wife, but without the ring or a lot of other stuff. By the time she was done being upset and angry with me for asking her to turn over A PIECE OF PAPER, I was officially into a ‘neutral’ mode - I was neither cheerful nor antagonistic, I was Joe from Dragnet. “Just the facts, ma’am.”

Her: I can’t believe you guys contacted the supervisor, he doesn’t know what’s going on!
Me: We did because we couldn’t get hold of you, it seems from what I have written here. Let me confirm your number, and I’ll make sure to pass it on to our General Manager.
Her: Why him? Why not one of you?
Me: We want to make sure there’s no miscommunication. *checking the records* Ma’am, this is just for x-2 dogs.
Her: SO?
Me: You were told to bring the shot records for ALL the dogs.
Her: I did before. I was never told that. What do you mean?
Me: *internally* we were told you were told this, I trust my GM over you at this point *out loud* Ma’am, per our pet police, you need to have the shot and rabies records for all animals present, and we only have the records for two out of x. I need the rest.
Her: Do you know how much those are?
Me: I don’t, no, but we do need the other pets shot and rabies records.
Her: *huff* Well, I don’t remember THAT
Me: Oh, well, here’s a copy of the pet policy then for you to read. This is the same one your husband signed when he checked in.
Her: *huffs again, takes paper, leaves*

So we count the days they’re leaving (end of the month) and all of us hold our breath, as the door is still dead bolted, the other paperwork never comes, and we leave her to our GM to take care of as their bills rack up. Finally, the move-out day comes. The room is blocked for a deep cleaning - we learn that the housekeepers hadn’t gone in there for a few days before the incident with the dog - and we brace.

Our checkout time is 11am. I am working that day on a schedule that allows me to do sort of a half-day due to our manning being down (I have learned to hate cold/flu season like the plague it was before this virus...) and housekeeping informs me at 1pm that they aren’t out. I try all the phone numbers.
Nothing.
I try the wife’s phone she swore she’d totally answer.
Nothing.
I try the room phone.
Big old nothing.
I leave voicemails on each and, realizing that no matter what I need them out - we have no rooms for them to extend even if they were blocked from it on order of our GM - and finally call security forces.

I explain the situation to the two who come in and also try to mentally prepare myself to go over and tell them to get out (please) and count any big dogs there are. I also have to tell Security Forces they HAVE dogs, and only two are known to have their vaccinations. They then ask if I want to come, and I tell them no, because yeah, no...

It’s about ten minutes later the wife calls.
Her: I’d like to extend our stay another 15 days.
Me: *mentally screaming* Ma’am, you’re due to check out today. Checkout time was at 11am. It’s now nearly 230pm. We don’t have rooms for you.
Her: Well, what are we supposed to do?
Me: Ma’am, you and your family need to leave. You’re late checkout and will be charged for that.
Her: where are we going to go? We have dinner in the oven!
Me: Ma’am, you were due to checkout today at 11am. I left you a few voicemails about it, explaining what’s going on. You also owe us over $1000.
Her: WELL NO ONE TOLD ME THAT! HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
Me: You do need to leave, or this will get escalated again to security forces. I have already called them to ask them to help you leave. We don’t have the rooms available and you were supposed to be out a few hours ago. That is all.
Her: *huff* then I guess dinner is ruined.

I told her to have a good day.

The rest of the day was fielding calls from another two people who were trying to find them a place to stay, including one who was very grateful I had gotten him a list of hotels in the general area. They finally stated they’d be out by 6pm, and we took that. I was gone by then but asked my coworker to please go around and make sure they were gone, and call the two if they weren’t or call Security Forces. 

So, funny thing about security forces - any and all calls to them are shown to the base commander...whoops for him.

After that things go to normal, save for the fact that our pet policy is now SUPER STRICT because we’re not letting that happen again, and housekeeping sends over the photos of the room they left, after explaining “yeah, they are on the hook for damages”. When asked how bad, we get a photo of the microwave glass plate BROKEN CLEAN IN HALF.
Y’all.

Their delinquent account is now managed by our accountant, who gets to fight them for the money. Included in this fight is the logic they never checked in on the day they checked in, they were actually staying somewhere ELSE for two days. When we didn’t quite have the ability to prove they checked in, all of us got a talk about making sure the guests sign SOMETHING. I only heard about them later, when the guest himself (not his wife) called to try to pay off some of his debt with his mother’s card.

He had been dealing with our accountant since he left. He knows how to pay off his bill. He shouldn’t be calling us. 

Whenever I seriously think about all the weirdness that I have seen over my years, I also think about these guys, their $1000+damages they owed us, and the fact that despite all their griping over how we’re totally singling them out, they basically taught us all to pay attention to signs, keep notes, and be ready for the worst.Military Inn Tales: There are Rules for a Reason",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"With everything going on, my office hours were cut at the hotel and to make-up the extra time, I took front desk hours.  The system I am working with is not the system I was initially trained on, so I’m basically a new hire and each night has presented a new, stressful challenge for me. 

Tonight I had an issue while running audit and had to call support.  While I’m on the phone with support, I can hear dogs barking, kids screaming, roosters crowing and doors slamming on top of the reception being terrible since support is working from home. 

With the background noise and phone cutting in and out, I’m a little frazzled when I get a call for a reservation. 
Hurriedly, I take the guest’s information and ask for his cc info.  He says he needs to get his card (I’m not paying 100% attention because my audit issue is more of a concern for me as support is on hold and reservations are fairly simple), and he asks if I mind if he relieves some stress while he’s on the phone.  I say sure and put him on hold, without delving into the possibilities of what that means, my biggest fear is that he just wants to shoot the shit with someone, which I have no time for and make it clear in my tone. 

I go back to support and apologize, asking for another minute and then resume the reservation request. 

I ask for the cc info again and he says, “yah, if I pause, just let me finish”.  Again, thinking this is just a weird dude, I concede and he begins reading the number “4601.... ohhhh..... I’m gonna cum, I’m gonna cum!”

And I hang up.

"Hiya, first post so please do not kill me for not making it nearly as entertaining as most of the post here on this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

The hotel I work at offers huge discounted rates on weekends (Week days £250-£300; Weekends £35-£50), thus meaning that most guests that come on weekends are guests that rarely stay with us or don't stay at hotels that much. So, on weekends we try to always take payment right at check-in so the guests don't get the hold on their credit/debit card and have to pay ""double"". Of course we have some guests that appreciate this gesture and then there are the guests that want to pay at check-out (Which is completely fine, but Pre-Auth has to be taken).

&amp;#x200B;

So about a month ago, on a Sunday, I was working morning shift and I get a call from a very angry customer that demands that we give him back his money because we have charged him twice and now he has gone into overdraft and has no money for the rest of the week (I don't really empathize with guests that tell me that they have gone overdraft as it is usually a lie). I was telling him that our Hotel has only taken charge for the one night, but that the second charge will show up as pending and will get released in up to 7 days after check-out depending on the bank that the guest uses. That makes him more irate as he keeps on saying that it is unfair that we have to take the Pre-Authorization, freezing the money on his account so he can't use it (As if we do it so the guest can't have money). I explained him that at check-in, we ask whether he wants to pay right away or if he wants to pay at check-out, and that as it is stated on the Reg Card, we warn you that a Pre-Auth will take place and that you are giving us permission by signing it. He then goes quiet for about a second, tries to string some words together but fails, and then says that he wants to speak to my manager as I have been very unhelpful, and would like to complain about me not trying to help him in the slightest. It being a Sunday morning, my manager was off, and so was our supervisor until the evening, so I advise him to call back in the evening if he so desperately wanted to call someone superior about me. He scoffs and hangs up on me.

(All that being said, we do have the power to clear Pre-Authorizations faster, but they do take up to 3 days as well. And contacting the bank about it is the longest process as on the other line it's just automated bots asking you 10 questions to take one step forward)

"So our location has a restaurant on site (an all American diner with maybe not the best quality food) but right now for social distancing everything is closed except for take out orders. Well obviously guests have been utilizing the restaurant so they don't have to leave the building. Well I had a woman come up to me complaining that some crazy lady (CL) was throwing a tantrum about being poisoned and she didn't feel safe going in there alone, so I had maintenance walk in with her and CL was nowhere to be found. Lady #1 got her food and left but it turned out that CL had forced her way into the kitchen and stolen the cleaning supplies from them. Now at this point I see her walk through the lobby and don't know she's the CL until I hear her screech at her husband ""I TRIED TO WARN THEM."" 

Anyway when she returns to her room she proceeds to dial 911 and I wait by the switchboard for her to get off the phone so I can do the mandatory follow up. CL made the longest 911 call I have ever seen and the whole time I'm waiting for her to finish so I know what steps I have to take. Finally she hangs up and I dial down to the room. The conversation goes:

Me: Ma'am is everyone alright there? I see you have dialed 911 do you need an ambulance??

CL: I AM 100% SURE THAT [RESTAURANT] POISONED ME WITH CLEANER. THEY ARE LUCKY THAT I'M ON THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMO BECAUSE I THREW IT ALL UP

CL's husband (background): Call poison control!

CL: NO JARED I GOT IT ALL OUT

Me: Do you need an ambulance? What can I do to help?

CL: NOTHING I GOT IT ALL OUT, THE POLICE ARE ON THE WAY!

Me: Well when they get here I will send them right to you. Let me know if you need anything.

The police didn't show, I ended up bringing the GM in to talk to her and she had the sheriff's department follow up with CL via phone call but that was that.

"It seems that with everything going on, people have been even pushier about wanting discounts on rooms, even though we're selling out rooms at all-time low rates. It doesn't help that $$$ine is false advertising our rooms $15 cheaper than what they really are (until you go to book it of course).

My last shift I caught a couple guests with their foots in their mouths. 

The first was a construction worker (CW) who wants to book a couple for Double Queen bed rooms for a week. After our pleasantries, the haggling begins:

&gt;Me: Our double queen rooms are running $89 right now, since you're a construction crew I'll give you our business rate of $75.

&gt;CW: &lt;dramatic hming and hawing&gt; I've only got a per diem for $80, can't you do any better? We're probably going to be here for a month.

&gt;Me: I might be able to give you our long-term stay rate, plus I'll move a microwave into your room, but I need manager approval, give me a sec. (go to the back, fake phone call, return, come back with $65/night rate).

&gt;CW: &lt;Gives insulted look&gt; That's still way too high man, can't do it.

&gt;Me: Well, good look finding anything better than that. Might want to negotiate a better per diem next time. 

&gt;An hour later, CW comes back in with a bucket of KFC: ""Ya know, I was thinking, for two beds that's not a bad price.""

End scene.

The last was toward the end of my shift. I'm sure most of us have had this one before, but it's still so satisfying. We'll call this person Smug Guest (because they think they have you on the ropes because they found a cheaper price online). I quote them a $79 rate for our King room.

&gt;SG: But I found it for $61 online.

&gt;Me: I guarantee that you didn't.

&gt;SG: I have it right here.

&gt;Me: Show me.

&gt;SG: &lt;Lifts up his phone triumphantly&gt;.

&gt;Me: Did you actually try to book it for tonight?

&gt;SG: No.

&gt;Me: &lt;Click a button, changes the date to tonight, suddenly the price leaps up to $71, so them their phone&gt; (I assume it's a prepaid rate).

After I soak in the pleasure from watching their smugness melt away, I gladly match the $71 rate because I'm such a damn nice person.

"So, we are at 18% tonight and I can't even get a monents rest. my first call was a guest about an issue that the 3-11 failed to address. I go to what is our nicest suite and see what I can do. The gentleman is nice enough about it all, but I notice the insane amount of booze on the table. It's a little much for one person for one night but I can't say anything yet.

Midnight rolls around and I get a buzz at the door. They're two of the methiest looking chicks you ever did see. My state in on lockdownm, we are NOT allowing locals at all. We are supposed to be rooming ""essential"" travelers only. They try to breeze past me so I ask how I can help them. They respond with ""We're going to our room, room XXX!!!!!"" I inquire further because they are clearly not here on essential business, and as stated at the buzzer, you must have a key or ID when the door is locked. I also questioned the room number because it's registered as 1 guest and clearly not them.

Pissy bitch finally provides me with the name and everything I need to allow her to pass. While waiting at the elevator they both start bitching about me and carrying on about how rude I am and none of my fucking business,, you know.. the usual. Cracky asks for my name, which I happily give and she makes sure to let me know that (garbled cracky word) will certainly hear about this! Great,, I hope she does let whomever that was supposed to be know that I'm actively trying to keep obvious problems out of the hotel.

About ten minutes later cracky 1 is back at the desk telling me she needs a key. I explained that as she's not the registered guest that I would need to talk to the guest before I can do that. This just pisses her off some more and I'm getting tired of it. First she tells me she IS the registered guest, which we had previously established that no,, no she's not. I reiterated that fact to her and she tells me she was when the reservation was made so I check that, and wouldn't ya know? It's a walk-in with no name changes having taken place. Then she tells me it was when my supervisor and previous shift were here, whatever. I call the room, it rings and rings and rings and eventually goes into the loop where it's gonna connect back to the desk so I tell her there is no answer. She very huffily tells me that ""You better just keep on trying then. I'm going to my car so figure it out.""

My supervisor is inhouse tonight so while I keep calling the guest on one phone I call my supervisor on the other phone. I was what she knows about the crackheads in XXX. She decides she needs to tell me in person. Cracky 2 eventually answers the phone as I ask to talk to Mr. X she tells me she can take care of whatever I need so I had to shut her down. While she's giving dude the phone all I can hear is her bitching and carrying on. He grants permission and everything goes away.

My supervisor makes it to the desk and starts telling me all of the stuff that the 3-11 should have.

They all showed up this evening demanding our best room for next to nothing because the ""owner"" said it was ok.... Now, we all know the moment someone pulls that shit it's a big red flag, we even have a note posted in the back office explaining that that's NOT how things work. Bitch let them in anyway..

When the supervisor arrived on property the desk told her about the owner and rate part but didn't say a word about the skanks and enough booze to kill a herd of elephants. She put the rate back to what it should have been, made him sign a new reg card because dropping the owners name means shit to us.

I have typed up my report for my manager and one for my owner including times so they can re-watch the footage of everything and my strong request/recommendation that they be required to check out in the morning. 

I want this shit to be over so the other hotels open back up to offset the trash trying to get a room here.Methanie and her little friend",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"One fine summer evening, Vivid is doing what Vivid does at the front desk when the phone rings. It’s an out of area number, I noticed.

Vivid: [NYC Hotel], how I can help you?

Intrepid Traveller: Hello, this is Intrepid. I still have the room for tonight, right? 

V : Let me confirm your reservation details. May I have your confirmation number, sir?

IT : We’re at the airport right now! We’re flying in from [European country] and we’re gonna be at the hotel in two hours. (From Europe? Ooookayyyy...)

V: Oh, then I wish you safe travels, sir. May I have your reservation number, or the name on the reservation?

IT: I just want to see that we have the right room.

V: I just need enough information to be able to confirm your reservation.

IT: Oh, can you trace it with my email?

V: That would be excellent. And the name on the reservation—?

IT: Ah, it should be under the name of Utter Bellend. My email is dingbat@yahoo.com. doyouseeitdoyouseeitdoyouseeit???

V: Sir, I don’t see a reservation under such a name. When did you make your booking?

IT : That can’t be right! We’re about to takeoff at Hotdog Airport and we’re arriving in JFK in two hours. What are you saying, did yOu lOse mY rEsErvAtIOn?!?!

Please note, that that is an impossible ETA. Flights between JFK and the EU country he claimed to be calling from are no less than 10 hours via nonstop flight. Dude. Stop playing.

V: Sir, do bear with me. Did you book directly from our website, or did you employ a third party site, like Fudging.com or Expletive.com? I would easily be able to verify your arrangements with them?

IT: Look, I’m gonna be at your property in the next *three* hours and I had better have a room waiting for my wife and kids!

V: Mr. Bellend, I am sorry that I cannot seem to identify your booking based on the information provided. I would be happy to cross check with our team to verify the details of your lodging arrangements. In any event, I shall contact you via the email you have provided me. That is dingbat@yahoo.com, correct? 

IT: That’s right. Oh, you’d better have my room right, lady! (Hangs up)


Okay. People of Reddit, can someone please help me understand: who waits until their *international flight* is about to leave before confirming that they have a valid hotel reservation awaiting them at the other end??? In a foreign country, no less. I smelt pork pies, but just to fulfill all righteousness, I researched the guest manifest. Then I checked the name on Fudging and Expletive. He most certainly did not have any sort of reservation at any of our properties. I emailed him to inform him of this. He never did respond, nor did he or any of his kin turn up.

EDIT: For those wondering when I had the dubious pleasure of observing this curiosity in the wild, this occurred mid summer of 2019. It was apparent within 30 seconds that this chap’s tale wasn’t kosher, but it cost me naught but a few minutes of my time to verify that this was a bogus call.You Better Have My Room Right",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Twas be the night before my 7-3 shift and I could not sleep at all. So, I decided to log into my hotels communication system and see what has been up with the hotel for the past three days I've been off work. Work cut my hours because of the virus, I didn't want to come in with a flood of messages. I clicked on my co workers entry from last night and he only posted stating, ""if you see blah blah you are to call the police no questions ask, do not engage, walk away and call the police"", he then went on to say if there are any questions about the incident as to why blah blah can't be here, please ask him in person or call me, GM didn't want what he did/said in the system, too inappropriate. 

This peaked my interest.

I called up to the work and I asked my co worker what the heck happened. He did a deep sigh and then told me the story about how a crazy man with a dog and his wife came in stating our sister hotel sent them over to us stating we will accept cash, straight cash, no questions asked. We don't but k. So, my co worker called that hotel and flat out told them, ""you and I both know we don't do this because we are apart of the same company, why are you sending these people over here lying""

He, of course, did not accept the cash, and would not check them in because the credit card was declining. He started to get aggressive about this and started yelling at my co worker, my co worker kept calmed and told him this is our policy, please respect this or leave. Crazy dude went outside, his wife stayed inside, my co worker called our managers and asked if they have a prepaid card with their name on it, that matches their ID, can they stay because it seems like they're in a tight spot. My managers said yes, but they will allow it for one night, that is it. The wife said she will tell her husband this, her husband though came back in and asked where the nearest liquor store was. Co worker told him right across the street. He went across the street. Wife sat outside. She came back in and said if her husband comes back over here looking for her, please tell him that she went to the store across the street. Co worker said of course.

About ten minutes later, the crazy dude called from a hardware store that is by the liquor store drunk screaming and cussing at him. Insulting him and stating he gave him directions to a hardware store not the liquor store. well he's drunk so he obviously found it. The insults and yelling got to the point my co worker hung up. 20-30 minutes later, the crazy dude runs into the lobby aggressively, slams and throws everything on our front desk, and then proceeds to go into great detail about how he was going to skull rape and murder my co worker. How he is going to take his eyeball out of his head and make him watch himself die and get skull raped. Mix in him demanding a free room with this and him still throwing shit around, you got a very good reason for arrest. Co worker asked for an ID, he made a reservation that was free, put down all information about crazy dude, gave him the key. As crazy was leaving the lobby to get his wife, he turned and put his hands into a prayer symbol and started praying to god, stating he is a good man, forgive him for his sins, did this for a good couple minutes. Co worker told him to get out. 

Crazy man left, co worker ran to the bathroom, called the police, called my managers and asked them to come up to the hotel and sit with him, he didn't want to be alone, don't blame him at all. Police finally came, they stated that another hotel in the area actually dealt with crazy dude too, and they have been looking for him all day, because he was threatening to kill himself in their hotel room. When they got to the hotel, he was no longer there. The other hotel was our sister hotel. You'd think they would fucking call and warn us, BUT NO NO THEY DIDN'T

Police start searching the area for him, managers called the store and liquor store across the street and asked if crazy dude was there. They both said yes, the store said he was screaming and getting aggressive with his wife, but kept telling everybody around him he was sorry and stopping to pray over and over again, the store kicked him out, not his wife. 

A few minutes later, a homeless man ran into the hotel, and ran to the room that my co worker assigned to crazy dude. They were apparently buddies. The keys didn't work though, they deactivated them, and homeless man came to the desk and asked if he can get a new key. They asked for the room number and name on the reservation. He had no ID, they knew it wasn't actually crazy dude, they refused to let him into the room and said if your name is not on the reservation and you have no ID, you cannot be let into the room. He got mad. Everybody stood their ground because this is our policy. He said crazy dude will be back soon and to just let him into the room.............no?

They called the police, police came and questioned him, he said he was aware of crazy dude threatening to kill my co worker, he was aware the police are looking for him, and the police flat out told him if they see him anywhere near the property, he will be arrested on the spot. Homeless dude leaves, don't see him again. Crazy dude and his wife never return.

After my co worker told me that story, I sent him a link of where I got my mace gun.

So now my work is low key on alert for crazy dude and homeless man, because the night after crazy stuff happens, hotel is always on alert and questioning everybody.0-100 very quickly",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We don’t have rollaway beds, can't be the only hotel without any but missing them still seems to surprise people. Our guestrooms are small and not meant to accommodate more people than there are beds for, except our suites that do have pull-out couches in them. Our websites states lack of rollaways clearly, but some third parties allows booking a standard room with one Queen-sized bed for +3 guests.

This tale is from before corona when we were time to time fully booked, this time only two rooms were available to sell. One of the rooms was a Garden room with a King sized bed and the other one of the rooms was our Terrace Suite with King sized bed as well but also had a pull-out couch. I was working alone at the front desk and only had one bell man working with me but he was driving our shuttle as well. A couple came to ask if we have rooms available and I did tell them that we have those two rooms available, I told them the rates and also mentioned that we would be happy to show them the rooms before deciding which ones they want. However, I had to make them wait for my bell man to come back and show them the rooms since I’m not allowed to leave the front desk unattended. They sit down to a couch near the front desk.

Next a family of four walks in and tell me their last name. I look at their reservation which they made through a third party and tell them that they have booked a room with one bed. It was obvious from their confirmation that the room has just one bed but somehow they were able to add four guest names onto the booking, from those four only one was visible on our system but their third party confirmation was clearly stating all four names. Whatever these happen, I offered them the suite with a pull-out couch and they took it.

This would have been all fine, but the couple who was waiting for the rooms to be showed to them and was observing the whole family check-in got upset on me. Now they only had an option to take the Garden room or then this standard room which just got available since this family couldn't fit in it. They told me that they were especially interested about the suite available, that I had just given away.

They cursed at me and left.

What would have you done? There was no guarantee that the couple would have taken the suite. Or what if I had sold them that suite before this family arrived, what should I have done with them then?Who should have gotten the suite?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It all started with the Gay Prostitute, who wasn't registered to any room, but seemed to have access to at least 2 different ones, who was about as dumb as a person committing crime can be. Standing by the side door he directed a vehicle to park, and out pop a old white man and a young black man. 

Hmmm. Ok. Strange pairing, but whatever. 

They both approach the door, the prostitute tells them only one at a time... Yeah, alarm bells going off.

The old white man hands him 40$. Oh boy...

Oh, did I forget to mention I was standing not 5 feet from them during all of this? 

I don't know what room number the guys in. I follow them up the stairs. They go to the 2nd floor, then to the elevator, then to the 4th floor. Hmmm... 

Finally catch up with them, and told them both to leave. They gave me attitude, I told them I would call the cops. I have never seen a old white man run so fast before. I then was accused of being Homophobic for 10 minutes before he leaves as well.

Whew... What a start to my night... 

Then I get a noise complaint about someone outside, in the parking lot, late at night, after mandatory curfew for our city, playing a guitar. I already know what this is. We have some workers staying with us, and this guy with the guitar has been a complete asshole the entire 4 or 5 days they have been here. He doesn't listen to anybody. We give them quite a bit of rope, and he wants more. Told them they needed to start packing it up and head inside. I gave them 15 minutes, plenty of time.

30 minutes later, they haven't even started picking up stuff. Guitar guy decides he wants to be a asshole again, and makes some comments. Had enough of that. Told him he needed to pack his stuff and leave. I gave him 15 minutes again, or I would call the police. After about 10 minutes he went upstairs, and was the first one to do so.

I noticed no one else was coming inside, so after I finished some stuff up, I went back outside, to find 4 people still out there, still haven't picked up anything. They finally start in my presence, while pleading with me to let their friend stay. 

I made them a deal. I would walk up there with them, and if he was in the process of packing up, I would give him one final chance. One of the workers even texted him, giving him a heads up.

What do we find when we get up there? Hes laying on the bed watching TV. Not a care in the world. He was again told to leave, refused, and police were called. 2 hours later, and several more noise complaints, the guy leaves with a official trespass warning ( I didn't ask for one, the guy was a dick to the cops too ).

Then I found out that there is a 3 room drug ring in my hotel. Lots of traffic, lots of short exchanges, etc. One room at the center of it all was already on watch, but had no concrete reason to suspect anything. Cameras showed a ton. Went down and got names, and google searched away. Lots, and lots, and lots of drug arrests. And one for.... Kidnapping and sexual battery of a minor... in 2016. Wait... wtf?

Yeah. Great. Trying to get the info from the sex offender search, just happen to click on the map bubble... and there are two registered sex offenders here. Fck. Sweet old man down the hall was arrest for groping a minor. 

Documented a bunch of stuff, went outside to vape, and heard some weird noise. Kinda sounded like snoring, but labored almost snorting. I find the source of the noise, its the worker that was trespassed... Sleeping in a truck, with the windows down. 

Police come back. Ask if I want to press charges. I really don't. I just want the guy gone, but he doesn't listen to employees, management, and now even the police. He is just going to come back again. I give the nod, and watch him woken up to the sound of handcuffs. 

Back to the drug ring... They are not quite as inept as the gay prostitute. I have no hard evidence. I have been doing this long enough that I know. Thankfully, the room this is all centered around belongs to mr sex offender, and we are within the boundaries of a place sex offenders cannot be.

I don't get to make that call though. Its nearly morning by now, management can take care of it in the morning. The last thing I want to do is deal with a 3 to 4 room ""eviction"" on top of everything else I dealt with already. Those things take 1-2 hours per room depending on the officers on duty. But if your wondering, 99.9% they all get removed tomorrow. My Manager has less of a threshold for such things.

We don't usually have any of these problems here. We aren't a upscale hotel, but we aren't bad at all. Coronavirus bringing down rates is awful. I have also noticed that when one person with bad intentions gets in, other people tend to follow them once they know the coast is clear. One room quickly becomes 3 or 4. We rarely ever have prostitution here ( at least, working out of the hotel ), and one night years ago I connected 7 different rooms to it, all with varying check in dates.Very interesting friday night....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, first time poster (I have a ton of stories but just reached enough karma to post-yay!)  I tend to be long winded and I’m on mobile so apologies for any mistakes. TLDR at bottom. 

A little background: So I don’t work at a hotel but I do work in the circulation department of my local library. This means that I work with the patrons returns and checkouts, oversee volunteers, and deal with patron disputes. A lot of my time is spent at the front desk dealing with the public. I don’t think I need to tell you all some crazy people use the library. 

Into the story:

At the beginning of last week right when the coronavirus was hitting it’s first swing in the US and people were crazily buying tp and hand sanitizer, we were still open to the public. I was off on Monday and when I came in on Tuesday, I saw that my boss had a small hand sanitizer 3M double sided taped to the front desk so patrons could use it. I thought this was a good idea as it was likely to be stolen otherwise. My boss said that they didn’t have any problems with it yesterday and did not foresee any today. 

I was an hour and a half into my shift when a surly man walked up to the front desk looking curmudgeony and confused. (This is normal as we just renovated the front desk and moved the book drops). I showed him where they were around the corner and thought we were done. I go ahead and help other people check out and hear a ripping noise as he came back to the front desk and just ripped the hand sanitizer off the desk and used it. At this point I assumed that he didn’t realize it was taped and mistakenly ripped it off to use it. However, there was a computer screen between me and him and I didn’t see or hear him put it back down. I lean around the screen to see the top of the bottle sticking out of his pocket. 

Now, I used to work in a daycare and babysit all the time and have a normal customer service voice but I also have a stern you know what you’ve done voice. As I see him turning to leave, I raise my voice and say “Sir, that’s ours!” He turns around and sees me looking straight at him and grumbles back to the desk, slams it down, and stomps out the front door grumbling all the way. 

I told the director and my boss about it and they all thought it was hilarious. We have cameras and our IT guy brought up the footage and we were laughing for a good 10 minutes. Guy thought he was so smooth. 

Sorry for the long post. Not one of my most exciting stories but one that’s recent and made me laugh. I have many more if you wish to hear them.

"Obligatory apologizes for my mobile post.

Male coworker brings a Mom and her 2 children up to the lobby and informs me she's waiting for a ride coming from about 45 miles away. He sheepishly grins as he realizes he just ruined any chances of me leaving early.

He also mentions the phone charger she's using belongs to another of our co-workers.

As I pack up my office on the eve of our ""Shelter in Place"" order, I'm anxious to decontaminate the lobby, lock the doors, and skadaddle.

I notice over the next hour she doesn't even speak to her children. Both under 5 years old; they entertain themselves. She spends her time playing on her phone. I hardly hear a peep.... Which is extremely unusual. 

A different co-worker brings Happy Meals for the kids. Apparently they've been with us much before our introduction.

I finally ask what the ETA is on her ride? I was in luck, her ride was pulling up. As she heads to the door, I pop out to the lobby to see if the charger is in the wall. I see it's not.

As she is already out the door; she's directing her incredibly well-behaved children to grab their items and go. I ask if the charger she has belongs to any one of us in the building. Here's how the rest of the conversation goes:

Me: ""Umm, Ma'am does that charger belong to any of us in the building?""

Lady: ""Well he just gave it to me.""

Me: *Starts looking in all the outlets*.   ""So what you're saying is that it's not YOURS?""

"Someone called a few moments ago asking for this information. As you well know, the majority of we Front Desk minions in smaller hotels don't have access to that information.  


So he verifies the front desk email that the first shift had given him this morning and when he asked for our owner's direct email or phone, I kindly stated that I did not have that information and that the address he was given was for the front office staff so we would be able to pass on whatever he wished to state.   


He kept pushing all while I simply repeated myself. He did finally give up and hang up, leaving me in a mental shrug.

It seemed a little fishy considering we’ve seen her here before and has never had any reward number on her file. We couldn’t prove it so we had to check her in 


It was a shit-show. They threw a birthday party in the rooms, adults in one room and kids in another. I had complaints about there noise level. They were warned twice to keep it down or they would be removed. 

The shift after me doesn’t give a shit about that type of behavior. Someone could sit in the lobby smoking a blunt and she’d probably join in. So they obviously didn’t get removed even though more complaints came through. 

The day they left I went to take a look at their rooms and they are TRASHED! Food up the walls, trash everywhere, about 100 popped balloons, alcohol spilled everywhere. Disgusting. 

I then contacted the Brand to check in to their reward points. I was informed the points were fraudulent. These people are members, but they just signed up. No way they have enough points to be top of tier lifetime earning member.

Now take the above scenario and throw in ONE guest with the same issue day after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ... after day ...

I have spoken to the same guest literally every single day with the same issue. The guest is not getting internet access.

Day 1:

FD calls me and tells me that guest is not getting access to the internet. I get transferred and I go through the steps.

Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network?

Yes. Okay. Do you see a checkmark next to &lt;Hotel&gt;?

No. Okay. Why don't you click &lt;Hotel&gt; for me please.

Great. You'll see a window pop up with the hotel logo.

Please enter the password &lt;bloarchg149&gt;. Click the checkbox and submit it.

Yes ... click the submit button.

What do you see now? Nothing is happening. Give it a few seconds. You'll see the hotel website and the top right corner will switch from ""cancel"" to ""done.""

Done. Great. Pleasure helping you!

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2:

FD calls me and tells me that same guest is not getting access to the internet. I get transferred and I go through the steps.

Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network?

Yes. Okay. Do you see a checkmark next to &lt;Hotel&gt;?

No. Okay. Why don't you click &lt;Hotel&gt; for me please.

Great. You'll see a window pop up with the hotel logo.

Please enter the password &lt;bloarchg149&gt;. Click the checkbox and submit it.

Yes ... click the submit button.

What do you see now? Nothing is happening. Give it a few seconds. You'll see the hotel website and the top right corner will switch from ""cancel"" to ""done.""

Done. Great. Pleasure helping you!

... I don't know why this is happening TBH. But I'm not going to dig into this.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 3:

FD calls me and tells me that same guest is not getting access to the internet. I get transferred and I go through the steps.

Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network?

Wifi is turned off you say. Hmm okay. Please give me a moment.

\*put phone on hold and start smashing everything\*

Hey! I'm back. Why don't you turn Wifi on for me please!

Okay. Why don't you click &lt;Hotel&gt; for me please.

It says not secure network. One moment please.

\*put phone on hold and scream. I don't know what to fucking do. Remote tech support is hard AF.""

I'm back! Why don't you open up safari for me.

You don't have safari? Okay, what app do you use to access websites?

Google? Google it is. Why don't you open up google for me and type in some random website. Let's see if this triggers the password screen to pull up.

Cool. Please enter the password &lt;bloarchg149&gt;. Click the checkbox and submit it.

It works? Great!

&amp;#x200B;

Day 4:

FD calls me and tells me that same guest is not getting access to the internet. I get transferred and I go through the steps.

Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network?

Wifi is turned off you say. Hmm okay. Please turn it on.

Why does this keep happening? I'm not sure, to be honest.

Verizon told you that your phone has no issues. Gee I wonder how they were able to tell you your phone has no WiFi issues. Oh so it's definitely the hotel's fault. Thank you Verizon. Go fuck yourself.

Have you tried force restart the phone? Uhh what phone do you have? Oh the iPhone 11. Gotcha. So you first press the volume up, then the volume down, and then

Oh you've done this before. Great. Oh you've tried this already. Well just try it for me please.

Wait, before you do. Let's turn on Airplane Mode.

How do you do that you ask. iPhone 11, so swipe down from the top right notch and click the airplane button. It should turn orange I think.

Great, now force restart your phone. Done.

Great. Let's turn on airplane mode. And head over to settings &gt; wifi.

And you're connected.

That's not the issue. You can't get Netflix? Uhm okay. Let's see. Why don't you try opening Netflix.

Oh you got Netflix now. Joy.

Oh you need help with the TV now. I guess I can give it a go.

You want to turn on closed captioning. (I realized this later, but I can turn on closed captioning through the internet, but I was already halfway through).

Alright, so do you have a menu button or something on the remote? Yeah. Go ahead and press that.

What do you see? Settings is the one you want.

How do you get there? Use the directional keypad to highlight Settings and click the center button.

Yes, I'm sorry. The Submit button.

Okay, and what do you see? Oh great. Yeah, select closed captioning and okay it.

How? Use the directional keypad to highlight it and turn it on.

It worked? Cool.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 5:

FD calls me and tells me that same guest is not getting access to the internet. I was like fuck it. We're doing it my way.

I open the router app thing that gives me access and I find her MAC address that I previous got from the FD a few days ago. I noticed Guest wasn't authorized on the network (which explains why the guest wasn't getting access), so I gave her authorization.

I told FD to tell the guest to open up a webpage, it should work.

It doesn't work and Guest gets ""not connected to internet"" message. So guess what we do now? We transfer and we go through the steps! Yayyyyy!

Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network?

Great. And you see the blue checkmark?

Great. Why don't you open up chrome for me.

You don't have Chr-- right, sorry. Google. Open up google for me please.

Google is not connected to the internet. Okay. Why don't you go to a random website for me.

Trust me on this.

It worked. Cool.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: \[Settings &gt; Wifi &gt; Are you connected to the &lt;Hotel&gt; network? Yes. Great. Enter the password. Click the checkbox. Submit it. You're online now.\] x 10000.

"So I work in a health network that's big in my state. Due to COVID my location is one of a few still open. That being said, this occurred only a few days ago and I'm still pretty angry about it. I work behind the front desk as a receptionist and handle folk's paperwork and insurance. My work out a policy in place that 1) no one is to complete paperwork at our desks, we are to have people go to their cars and complete it over the phone and 2) employees are allowed 1 mask per day and it's only the flimsy loop over ear kind that stops droplets from going out but doesn't stop anything going in.

  I had a person doing paperwork in front of me before everything happened last Monday (10 days ago now) that, unbeknownst to me, was being swabbed for COVID. Their results came back positive and the nurse that swabbed them was sent home immediately as soon as that was discovered. I on the other hand was told if I wanted to leave that that was ok with my supervisors, I told them I was ok working until I showed symptoms then I'd quarantine.
 
  On top of this I live with immunocompromised people, that I had contact with, including my own toddler. I wasn't given a mask until a co-worker's husband gave her masks to hand out to us receptionists. Monday morning, I'm taking care of 2 walk-ins for our mental health department when my supervisor tells me that they know who it was and informed me I had been exposed a week prior. We then are also informed that the small masks we have are considered enough by the CDC to count as PPE.

  Sorry this post won't make any sense, I'm just angry about it and feel helpless as I miss my husband and son, I haven't left my bed much in 3 days to protect my family and my heart breaks to hear my son but not be able to see him, I'm stuck here until Tuesday at least.

UPDATE: my results came back this morning and they came back as negative, every respiratory disease came back negative that they tested for. So now I'm just at home enjoying time with my family, I will return to work tomorrow morning. Thank you all for your responses and those still working please stay safe. Everyone else please stay home unless necessary.

UPDATE 2: I have started sewing masks for my front desk team, we are still having issues getting PPE so I'm taking this into my own hands. It's better than the flimsy masks that are available to us. Wish me luck and hopefully my co-workers like them and will be protectedYou've been exposed to COVID, oh and company says your masks are fine",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work at an independent small hotel.  I work the night shift.  It's just me from 11pm-7am.  I now have to handle breakfast as well until the BK attendant shows up.  We have a walk around phone so I can answer calls when away at the desk.  I have sign I put out that tells guests where I am.  It also says to call the number.  This is the tale of the asshole who couldn't read.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm back in the kitchen making breakfast around 5:30.  There is a door and hallway that connects to the front desk and lobby off the back of the kitchen.  It's very nice.  We keep our stuff in there, cubbies for our personal items and just random stuff we need AND the valet box with all the keys for the guest's cars.  The kitchen back door is open so I can see into it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly a guy opens the door that's off the lobby that leads to this hallway/frontdesk/kitchen and starts to go through the car keys.  WTF.  It says employees only.  I wish we could lock it.  I quickly stop what I am doing and go towards him asking him just what he thinks he's doing.  This isn't cool.  I do not know who he is.  The front door is locked but still.  No touch!   

&amp;#x200B;

He angrily says he needs his keys, he is late and needs to leave.  I said please get out, I'll get his keys.  He say he doesn't have time for this!   He's been looking for me for forever!  He said he went all over the hotel, even downstairs!  Why weren't you at the front desk?!  He has been waiting for 30 minutes! Just as he leaves he calls me a bitch.  

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse me?!  I call him out on it.  I tell him if he had looked at the sign it says where I am and did he call the front desk?   He glares at me.  No, he said, you weren't here so I did't think it would work.   I say that doesn't mean you can call me a bitch.  I am doing my job and you were in an  employee only area.  I get his name and room number, verify it and give him his keys.

Nothing came of it, but I left a note for my manager what happened.  It really pissed me off.  He was upset at his own stupidity and took it out on me.You don't get to call me a bitch, sir.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Okay so yesterday evening my county received a “shelter in place” order. Shortly after it was extended to the entire state. Obviously we’ve been expecting this and have been preparing. We are capping out at 50% occupancy, changed the way we handle check ins and discontinued any stay over services as precautions among other things. Since we are considered “essential” we’re doing everything to operate as smoothly as possible with all these restrictions.

Once the alerts went out I got multiple phone calls at the desk which was to be expected, mainly asking if we were staying open. Talked to all the people explained that it will be business as usual until told otherwise and that we would notify them of any changes. About an hour later this “regular” guest comes, he’s the obnoxious “you checked me into a dirty room last night, the people above me made noise all night I want a free room, your staff was rude to me I’m calling corporate” gender bent Karen type...

Big ole smirk on his face, “ I need you to extend my key until “quarantine end date” now”
“Imma need payment until “quarantine end date” then”..
“NO THEY SAID SHELTER IN PLACE SO I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR MY ROOM!!!”
Oh honey!!! Not how this works... 
we had a huge back and forth and he started threatening me making a mess in my lobby... told him if he continued I was gonna have him removed from the property and he would not be refunded...

He continued! 

Sheriffs came out, he tried explaining that “shelter in place” meant he didn’t have to pay for his room, they shut that down real quick and removed him from my property.
As they were rapping up I had another guest come down, literally trying to bring up the same topic... sheriff walks in hears her rant and shut her down for me. Was great. Have a feeling it’s gonna be more of the same when we do departures on the morning, but that won’t be on me...“Shelter in place” is my new favorite topic!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"As I have stated in other posts, and just like a lot of you fine folks, our breakfast has been halted - we are not even doing ""Grab N Go"" bags - and our Bar &amp; Grill is shut down, but it's not like there isn't any other place where you can get food.  Most restaurants are still delivering, have their drive through open, or are doing take out, so you can still get something to eat here.  Liquor stores are still open, so you can grab yourself a bottle or a six pack - or both - so there really is no need to heap abuse upon the poor front desk workers that are still working.

Now that I have that out of my system ---- I received a completely baffling phone call the other day.  A lady called and asked if we were offering ""Shelter in Place"" to families.  She stated that she and her family are homeless and need 3 rooms.  I told her we had rooms available and she asked if they were free.  I told her no, and quoted her our rate (1/4 of what it should be right now) and she became very indignant and stated that ALL motels and hotels in the entire state of California is giving free rooms to the homeless (is this true, my California peeps?), but she and her family wanted to move to Arizona (where I am), so she doesn't see why we aren't doing it.  I told her I wasn't sure why, I just know we weren't doing it.  That's when she hit me with this gem that still has me puzzled - **""Well, how do you think you are going to make money if you don't give us free rooms?""** and then hung up on me.

Ummmm - technically, if we give you free rooms, we are LOSING money.  I kind of wished she hadn't hung up on me so I could find out exactly how we could make money giving out free rooms, because my GM and the owners would love to be making more $$$$$ right now!!That's Not How This Works",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Greetings Fellow Hoteliers,

I, like so many of you, am going through the COVID-19 motions as part of the 25% of staff that still remains at my hotel. I've handled the changes as best as I can, but tonight may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Backstory: GM has been covering desk shifts for the first time since she was no doubt promoted to GM. She doesn't seem to think that she needs to follow any of the checklists we have in place for responsibilities to be completed during a shift. She has no problem assigning tasks that she doesn't want to do herself, but has the audacity to claim that ""all operations of the hotel are a team effort and require a village."" Ok, she's lazy af, but we've all known that for some time. 

This morning upon her arriving to work late in relieving me, I ask her if I would see her tomorrow, to which she replied ""I don't have the luxury of getting days off."" Whoa there Bessie; This lady hasn't been at the hotel more than 5 days a week since I started here 8 years ago. She has no problem putting employees on 7, 10, 21 day stretches, for 8, 10, 12, 16 hours at a time and now she has the balls to complain? I was honestly insulted. 

I show up to work tonight for a 12 hour shift, and there is an entry in our shift log from said lazy, ballsy manager: ""For reporting purposes, every shift, going forward, and until further notice, please provide a complete list of duties performed outside of regular checklists."" I almost walked out right then and there. I've been in Hospitality for going on 15 years, and I feel like I've earned the right not to be micromanaged by a lazy cow that doesn't have a filter on her mouth.   
Am I being overly sensitive due to the current happenings or am I justified in my feelings, because I'm this close to telling her to furlough me too and I'll just collect the unemployment and find a new job after this is all over. 

I'm super thankful to have an outlet like this page to rant and seek advice. Good luck out there to all of you. Stay safe and wash your hands.""Reporting Purposes""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It has been dead at my hotel, I have spent a majority of my audit shifts playing the new Animal Crossing.

Well about an hour ago I check in a guy, his wife and his young daughter. It is about as unmemorable as a midnight check in can be. I tell them how to get to the elevator and assume I won't see them again.

I hoe in the back with my co-worker to get some more training, I'm gone for maybe a minute when I hear this dude already loosing his shit. lots of loud ""HELLO? HELLO? DOES ANYONE WORK HERE?"". Like bro I just helped you, I also called out and said I was on my way. Chill!

Anyway I come out and he is all kinds of red in the face. His family looks fine but this dude is huffing and puffing.

Guest: YOU NEED TO GET THE POLICE HERE NOW! MY DAUGHTER HAD TO SEE A NAKED MAN!

Guest: I went to the elevator you told me to go to and there was a naked Japanese man inside!My 12 year old daughter had to see a naked man, I want him arrested!

So I get on the phone with security, they will check it out ASAP and get authorities involved if possible. I tell the guest to go get back to their room and to let me know right away if anything else happens. 

After about 15 mins the guest calls down demanding an update. His is pissed when I explain we were unable to see a man from our cameras (they don't show inside the elevators) and we were unable to locate him on any room floor. I mentioned several times that security was still active in their search. Guest gets even more pissed, demands to talk to police RIGHT NOW. I explain again that our security team is handling things.

I get it man, it really sucks that a random ass man decided be naked in our elevators but since we can't find him there isn't much else we can do. I am also high key upset we did not find this streaker, would have made my night more interesting.Naked Elevator Man!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So we've been limping along for a while now.  Our owner is in the hole, we're about to get furloughed, and we've had to close down a lot of our amenities.



We've had a lot of our guests be very understanding about the breakfast being closed down.  We've had people disappointed about the pool and hot tub - I get it.  We had a lot of people who loved coming here for the breakfast and the pool and, thanks to the virus, that's gone.  I get it.



We've had to switch to the brown bag breakfasts, and we're actually being more generous than brand standards.  And yet, about two mornings ago, I had a lady almost throw the contents of one of our breakfast bags at me, calling it garbage.  How dare we not be more prepared, when local stores are pretty much tapped out and our deliveries have been cut down due to lack of income, yes, how dare we not be more prepared.  How dare we not go out and buy food up from people who can't afford to stockpile.  How dare we not bow and scrape to someone who wasn't even a shiny member.



We've had shiny members claiming they weren't acknowledged when we all know that the person who was on duty is our top-notch people pleaser.  We've had threats to go to different brands. Go ahead.  Actually, just go home.  We don't want that attitude around here.



The world is going to hell, but this handful of people?  I can't believe their lack of understanding for what's going on in the world and how little it matters, in the long run, that they were given a pack of sandwich crackers instead of a bagel.Covid brings out the entitlement in everyone",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Well, I'm still employed. For now. The hotel is staying afloat by having slashed our rates by two-thirds, and now half.

Of course this means that we are attracting a very different sort of *clientele* than we are accustomed to. Sigh.

Tonight gentle readers, we shall speak of why I had to invoke Angry Skwrl this morning. Fun.

I Have Had A Night.

First, know that I'm coming in an hour later than usual, due to a new four-shift schedule designed to give everyone some hours during this slow time. Unfortunately, the Nexus Of Sin software update was pushed to last night for us. No problem, plenty of warning, leave a note for the gal working before me that she would need to do the audit at 11pm, as the system is unavailable in any capacity during the update process. Yes, it's stupid and we hate it.

So it was that I rolled in at midnight, sadly bereft of delicious tacos, and found everything completed and hahaha no. It was a disaster. The audit hadn't been run, the reports hadn't been printed, and the gal I was relieving was in full panic.

It seems that the assistant manager had misunderstood the memo, and thought that 3am Eastern time would mean *tonight*, not yesterday. So she dutifully *removed* the note. Argh. Also, there was someone wanting to check in, but with the system down, there wasn't much she could do.

So I showed my coworker how to manually check someone in - blank reg cards here, good thing she printed the room list (this is WHY we print the room list), and got the guest settled in.

Soooo... No audit to do, no guests to come in, no breakfast bar to set up... 

\*tumbleweed rolls past*

Someone in the room above the back office ( yes, [that room](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/d6bf58/literally_on_all_the_drugs/) ) is stomping around. I mean, I get it, we have thin floors. Folks have likened it unto [elephant ballet](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/dc7ni1/swan_lake_only_with_elephants/) before, despite it being someone walking around normally. This is different. ThumpThumpThump. Somewhat distracting from my perusal of various online distractions. But since there's no guests under them to complain, I let it slide.

The stomping continues periodically throughout the wee morning hours. A guest wants to check in early, is okay with the half-day charge, just wants sleep. System came back up ten minutes ago, so can do, but it'll be tricky - I haven't done the audit so it's still 'last night' in the system, and it's a prepaid OTA so I can't change the dates. Quicky make a new reservation, rate of half-day, note they're continuing, check them in, done.

Run the audit, make the coffee, hand out some breakfast goodie bags. Thumper thumps thumpily.

I'm setting up the coffee when a man comes in. He's in nurse scrubs, which might as well be the robes of a saint in these times. He heads upstairs. Don't think much of it.

My relief comes in, give her the rundown of the complications of the night. During the handoff, the thumping is quite noticable.

""... Oh yeah, and \*thump* there's that.""

""Jeeze, how long \*thumpthump* has that been \*thump thump* going on?""

""All \*thumping* morning. No idea what they're \*ThumpThump* up to but they're \*thumpThumpWHAM* ... Okay, I think I'd better stay on the clock and see what they're up to.""

Up the elevator. Getting out, I can already hear some loud voices. Not quite sure of the nature of the argument, but they are NOT happy in there.

A loud and clear ""Bitch you are Mother-****ing CRAZY!"" Switching gears, going from Professional Skwrl resolving a noise complaint to Angry Skwrl who is very likely having to break up a domestic dispute of some flavor.

I reach to pound on the door, only for it to open as I do. Yep, they're in full trailer trash/daytime television meltdown. It's the guy in scrubs, and a woman maybe half his size. In a display of true squabble fashion, she's hanging out of her top on one side.

He's trying to leave, she's trying to stop him. I think things were about to get VERY physical on both sides, but for the sudden presence of your humble narrator in a bad mood.

""WHAT'S ALL THIS THEN?!"" (Yeah,  my sense of humor pops out at odd times) I am between them, palms out like I'm training raptors or something. ""Right, YOU over there, YOU stay in there. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. You're DONE. You're stopping NOW. No more!""

There were some protests and ""he's an asshole"" and ""she's crazy"", but Angry Skwrl Has Spoken. Out you go sir, it's a nice morning out, go for a nice little walk. Huff. I'm not sure what the argument was about, and I honestly don't care, but I suspect their relationship may have been *transactional* in nature.

Head back down, appraise my coworker of what happened. Tell her if there's anything else from that room, call the cops. Deep calm breathing. Thoughts of bunnies eating clover.

So funny thing. The thumping continues. It's just walking around now, but somehow the woman who was maybe ninety pounds soaking wet has the heaviest gait I've ever heard.

"Firstly, they are human beings like the rest of us with fears and anxieties. Without staff, the building isn’t all that secure so being a high-rise in a major city, the FD staff is considered “essential personnel.” I’m honestly just happy to still have a job. Now that I got that out of the way ...

Two thirds of the people here are hunkered down and self-sufficient. It’s a pleasure to work for them and help them out through this trying time. This post is a bit of a vent though, so I’ll be writing about the other third. We’ll call them the worst third of the top 1%.

This third echo the characters in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned. In that book, the main characters grow up wealthy and have very few practical skills. Now in the book, they don’t have marketable skills either which is only true for a smattering of this group in my building. 

This large portion can’t cook for themselves, clean for themselves and the only way they know how to cope with life’s little chores (the skills most have to figure out between age 12 and 20) is to throw money at them. They never learned how to be adults so they pay working class people to be adults for them. 

Now that our state is under a lockdown, certain people have been banned from the building. This means maids, personal assistants, personal trainers, chefs, organizational gurus, tech people (they hire people to plug in their DVD players) etc. 

So while all are suffering from the standard social distancing isolation that we all have to cope with, some are coping for the first time with the fact that they have no real life skills. 

I overheard someone today talking about how they were washing their dishes with laundry detergent until they Facetimed someone who pointed out their mistake.

Some have tried to get me or other staff to come clean their condominiums. 

I know a woman in her late 50’s who did her own laundry for the very first time in her whole life this week. She and her son had a small kitchen fire because they are also cooking for themselves for the first time.  They found this fire hilarious. 

Another guy who is a paranoid member of a family that is apparently a quite famous name among the rich (though I had never heard of them until I started here), called to ask me if the staff were all wearing gloves and N95 masks. I told him there was a shortage and that we are following official guidance on these matters. He said “but if someone were to somehow acquire a fair number of them, would you wear them?” 

I said “we are following official guidance” again but this time, in a monotone. This is customer service speak for “WTF is wrong with you, there is a shortage and ER nurses are having to wear towels that grandmas sew together like it’s the gd Battle of Antietam and you are going to use your wealth to get them for your concierge staff instead of the local hospital?”

Some complain that we have no hand sanitizer out. To one, I said incredulously “well there is a shortage and we haven’t been able to get any.”

“Well over at the Ritz they have it at all the entrances. I don’t understand why they have it and you don’t.” 

I said “Oh that’s great of them, I wonder how they were able to get supplies“ which is customer service speak for “Then go move to the Ritz.”

It could be worse I guess … There’s kid in his 20’s (with unlimited funds from his rich foreign father) who’s complaining to my boss that our sister building (under same management company) won’t let him bring in his typical hookers and blow for the weekend.

"So I work at a hotel (although I am currently laid off because of COVID-19) and we abide by certain policies and procedures, like any good business. One of those includes charging an additional fee to accommodate pets when guests bring them along (a simple service fee for the chemicals that are used by the housekeepers after the pets are in the room, because future guests might have a pet allergy) which is posted not only on the website but is agreed to by the guest when they fill out a “pet waiver” form.

Now some guests these days use their phones bluetooth as their key, through the hotel brand’s consumer application. This does create some issues with guests trying to sneak in pets, for which we typically just tack on the pet fee and then deal with their complaints if they end up making them.

One man came in a few months back and asked “Hey, I got the digital key, do I need to do anything else?” I said no, you’re good to go. He went to his car put all of his stuff on the luggage cart and I noticed him on the way in, it had a dog carrier on it with a little chihuahua in it (the dogs, the dogs name was Bam — which is funny how cute that is given how much I have mentally dehumanized his owner). I stopped him and told him to fill out the pet form, which he already had misgivings about, because I said he was all good before.

He filled out the name and room number and stuff but then he noticed the bullet point explaining the fee ($75 — kinda steep, but it’s a flat rate for the whole stay at an extended stay hotel). To this he said “What’s this, $75?” And when I explained he said “But I’m a member, does that not mean anything.” He refused to agree to sign the form and I said “Well then your pet cannot stay here.” He spoke more haughty bullshit until finally TRYING TO GO OVER MY HEAD BY CALLING THE 1-800 number. Cute.

He goes outside with his luggage cart in a huff and in a few minutes I get a call from the customer service hotline desk, on his behalf. They usually try to get you to agree to whatever the guest wants but I was like “Oh, fuck no. Fee ain’t getting waived.” Them: “Are you sure?” Me: “Does a bullfrog bump its ass a-hoppin’?” Eventually they put me on with him and he said he was gonna seek accommodations elsewhere (at this point I am channeling Dirty Harry, thinking “Go ahead...make my day”) and I tell him that there is a cancellation fee, and he would be charged for the first night of his 5 night stay. He didn’t even listen to me.

I not only charged him that but when I found that he left my damn luggage cart in the parking lot (like a sack of shit), I called the 1-800 number and reported that he tries to sneak pets, because he told me that he stayed at another property with the same flag as mine and didn’t pay one, not knowing that I happen to know the brand standards.

"TLDR: Guest busts a sprinkler pipe during night audit, and the fire marshal says we gotta kick all of the guests out, so no need to make breakfast that morning.

Thanks to the virus, I haven't made actual hotel breakfast in about a week. But, this isn't the first time I've worked audit without prepping breakfast.




It was a few years ago, probably about 6 months after I started working in hotels. I was cozying up to a YouTube video and starting to fold towels when the fire alarm suddenly went off. I still remember that it was about 12:30am.


Immediately I call my GM and Maintenance Guy in between receiving a flurry of phone calls from confused guests. For all I knew, this was a real fire and instructed everyone to come down to the front and to meet outside as I printed out my ""in case of emergency"" reports.

Somewhere in this madness, I get a call from room 421. Now, anyone who's tried to talk on the phone while the fire alarm is alarming knows it's near impossible to understand anyone on the other end. At this point, all I can remember making out was that the alarm involved his room in some way, and so that's where I directed the fire department when they arrived.

Then, a guest told me that there was water coming out of the ceiling down the hall. I walk over to the spot, and it turned out water was flowing down from multiple ceiling light fixtures on half of the first floor.

Thankfully Maintenance soon arrives as does the AGM and they take over command as I man the desk and phone.

It takes a while for them to sort out what was happening, but when they do, the news is grim.

We have to close the hotel and send all of the guests elsewhere for at least tonight. 

Thankfully we weren't sold out as it was a Sunday night with only a handful of business guests but still a massive blow to revenue. GM was devastated.

So, what happened? Remember 421? Turns out he managed to knock the closet door off the wall (he apparently claimed it just fell, but that seems unlikely since during the madness he decided to toss the door into the dumpster), and the door broke through the closet wall and punctured a sprinkler pipe, spraying water all over the place. Well, the sudden lack of water pressure caused the fire alarm to sound and brought us to where we were now.

Not only was half the hotel now flooded (from the 4th floor down to 1st), but because they had to turn off the sprinkler system, the fire marshal informed us that we could not house any guests without a functioning sprinkler system.

So, all of the guests were sent to other hotels without being charged by us for the night. To my memory, most of them were understanding. 

I can't recall what happened to Mr. 421. He was a nice guy and a regular. The only complaint we had of him before that point was that he'd cover his room smoke detector so that he could cook with a portable hotplate in the room (which normally would set off the detector as we were not an extended stay property nor were our rooms set up for cooking). I only saw him once after that as he started staying at a competitor property, which was fine by me since it was really awkward seeing him after that night.

Thankfully the sprinkler system was up and running by morning, but half of the hotel was soaked, and we expected to be sold out Monday-Wednesday as we always were. Somehow through the magic thumb of my GM, she managed to halve our arrivals by the time I came in Monday night by contacting them in the morning and explaining why we couldn't honor their reservation. For a while, half the hotel was blocked off with fans running non stop to dry the carpet, and some professionals working during the day to make sure we didn't become the Mold Hotel.

I'll still always remember awkwardly folding laundry at 4am with my GM and Maintenance Guy just feeling defeated by everything that had happened on top of getting no sleep. GM told me not to even bother making breakfast since there'd be no one in house to eat, and that she had to let the breakfast person know not to come in that day.

It was a tough night, but just like this pandemic, thankfully it eventually passed and the hotel got back up and running.That Other Time I didn't Make Hotel Breakfast on night audit...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey all, I know I promised this story as my next one. With everything happening in the world, I figured a funny story could help take our minds off it. I also want to say, my heart breaks for everyone right now, and I hope this ends soon.

Now this story was told to me the day after it happened, and some of the details are from what I experienced the next day. I will try to make this as not confusing as I can given that there are two perspectives in this story. There also isn't really a cast, as this is less a tale, and more summary of what happened. Also, it is important you know the property, we did more events, and less guests stayed with us, so with that being said our conference rooms were insane in their size, but we only had about 130 rooms to rent and sleep in. So with that being said, and with out further ado, here we go...

This happened years ago, and I was just a regular desk agent, but the hotel I had worked at agreed to have a nudist wedding, and yes I mean the actual wedding, in one of our conference rooms, as they were huge rooms that could fit a whole circus if we wanted. There were of course rules that sales had set up, mainly, clothes were absolutely required in common areas. Now the screw up was there was a cash bar, and anybody that works a cash bar knows, people do NOT hold back.

Now, this wedding had booked almost all of our rooms, I'd say, out of the 130 we had, they booked 100 of them, and our two largest conference rooms. The only other people outside from them were the staff, so that was a plus, and when the wedding started they were fine, and pretty funny people to be honest. As you can guess, nothing got crazy until the reception, which was held in the second room. The bartender was back in the room where the ceremony was held, as we can't serve food and drinks to people with no clothes on, I assume, I don't know, I didn't pay much attention with the why.

As these people got drunk, they started getting more loose with the clothing policy in place, as it was explained to me, they started coming upstairs from the conference rooms in less and less clothing every time, until they eventually were just naked everywhere they went. Why the team on staff that night didn't do anything about this is beyond me, but had they done this, I wouldn't have the best part of this story.

The nudists at this point, were skinny dipping in the pool, running up and down the floors, chilling on the furniture in the lobby and just enjoying themselves. I suspect staff didn't care as they were all admiring said guests (yes... really) but then, IT happened. There came screaming, laughing, and yelling from the second floor, mind you, the second floor had a staircase that connected to the lobby, so when you walked down, you'd be looking straight at the front desk. The bride was coming down said stairs, shitting. She was actively moving down the stairs with this liquid coming out of her, and paid no mind to it.

Finally the desk took this as too much, and corralled her back to her room, with the help of the sober husband that had lost her. They also sent everyone else to rooms, and had to call professional cleaners to take care of the mess. The kicker here, the cleaners were closed, and had to come in the next day, and this is where I come in. As I pull into the hotel, I see vans, and literally people in masks, with some heavy duty cleaners ( I assume) coming in and out, also with big red bags. I step in the hotel and nearly vomit from the stench of alcohol, feces, and just human B.O., get to the desk, and finally have the events of the night recapped for me.

I was crying at that point, but I don't know if that's because my nose was burning from all the smells, or just laughing that hard, but crying nonetheless. I leave and buy some masks for the staff that had to be on duty, but as you'd expect, we took no reservations that day, and just shut the hotel down. We had to be there to take phone calls, which the amount of angry people you can imagine was through the roof. The bright side was the bride called us back and could not have been more apologetic. She was extremely embarrassed (as you would guess) and not only paid all the cleaning fees, which I don't know the total of that, gave every employee that worked the night about $200 for having to deal with her, and the wedding party. She also accepted that the hotel will no longer be letting her and some of the others stay, and did not try to fight it.

I am glad that she at least knew what happened, and accepted her monumental F up, as I have had plenty of guests do things that make me scratch my head in wonder, although, not to that scale. Sorry for the length, but I do hope you all enjoyed it, and I hope it helped put a smile on your face. I try to answer comments, so go ahead and ask anything you want, or say whatever.

Note: I will not give names of the city, state should I be in a place that has that, country, property, or chain I worked for, as I hope to keep the identities of anybody involved a secret, as I'm sure you all will understand.The Nudist Wedding",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Manage a 99-room property. Amazing staff who have been with me for years - they know the property, regular guest preferences, and policies...pretty sure they all know check out time! 

Our set check-out time by 11AM. Late check-out of noon available upon request for no charge. 11:45am, no request of late check-out - I call room. Man answers with ""we'll be out soon"". Ok, great. Maybe they thought check-out was at noon, or FD forgot to leave a note? No problem. 12:15pm: still not out of room. Just down hall from FD so I go over to politely check to see if they needed to extend their stay. 

Politely knock on door announcing my presence. Man opens door. Woman is doing her hair/make-up behind him. Stuff all over the room.

"This is a fairly short one about my favourite (read: memorable, but glad I won't see him again) interaction with a guest. 

We have the joy have having a fairly reasonable clientele. We rarely have problems, and probably 95% of the time, it's a one-and-done for asking them to behave. This was the case on this particular evening, but that wasn't good enough for one person.

Cast:

Me: Playing Me

LAG: Playing Lying-Ass Guest

So, we're having a middling kind of night, sitting just over half full. About 1:30am, I get a call from a fairly irritated LAG, who had a room at the back of the motel.

LAG: ""You'd better come back here shut down this fucking party!""

Me: ""I'll be right there.""

I hang up and head straight there. The ""party"" was two guys having a conversation on the balcony about 4 rooms down from LAG. They were being a little loud, so I asked them if they could please call it a night. They apologized and said they would go into their room as soon as they were done their cigarettes.

I head back to the front desk, wait about 15 minutes, then go do another round of the building. They're in their room, door very slightly ajar, but I could barely hear them even right outside the room. Problem solved, right?

I wish.

I get back to the front desk, and no sooner do I sit down than LAG calls again.

LAG: ""Where the fuck are you? There's, like, 20 people having a party in the back lot.""

Me: ""I just got back from there. There were two people outside talking, and they have retired to their room.""

LAG: ""Bullshit! You come fix this or I get my money back.""

I look at the security cameras. There's no one. Still, I make a quick round. I get back to the front desk and, sure enough, LAG shows up.

LAG: ""Since you can't do your fucking job, I want my money back.""

Me: ""I did. There..""

LAG: ""You didn't do shit! They're still in the back parking lot partying!""

Me: \*bring up the security camera for the back lot\* ""Where, exactly?""

LAG: ""Well, they're gone, now. I still want my refund!""

At this point, I'm thinking, ""Screw it. If it'll get him out of here faster.""

So, I give LAG his refund, and as he's leaving, he grins at me and says, ""I got shitty night's sleep, but I got my fucking refund!""

Me: \*big smile on my face\* ""Have a nice night!""

LAG: \*scowls and turns a rather amusing shade of red\* ""FUCK YOU!""

And, with that response, I would say I won. Yeah, he got his money back for the 4 hours he was in the room, but he's been blacklisted here (and at every other hotel in town), so I'm happy.""I just got a free night!"" Good for you.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"My hotel is not doing so great, we were expecting a lot of people to travel for Spring Break, instead we got a whole lot of cancellations instead. Not to mention the original owner the property to two of his brothers who had hired a management company to oversee the transition and it looks like they mismanaged at least a few things. For one thing it looks like they put of paying a whole lot of bills as best they could to make it seem like the hotel was making more money than it was, so when the new owner came it he was sitting on thousands, possibly 10's of thousands of unpaid invoices. 

That combined with all the cancellations has left us with single digit room arrivals per day. So the owner wants to do heads in beds. Normally we are allowed to be a bit discriminating, if we think someone is sketchy or they might cause problems we can turn them away. Now people are being more lenient and it's already biting me in the ass.

So yesterday someone drives in and asks how much for a room. I has him what type and he says he needs to talk to his girlfriend. They then sit in the parking lot for a good 40 minutes before coming back in. Seems sketch but necessarily damning. Then their friend walks up to them from off the street and a few minutes later they come in for the room. The woman's card doesn't have a chip, normally I wouldn't let them check with that  but is has her name matching her ID I thought hey, if the swiper on the chip reader authorizes it should be good, right? Yeah, I don't know. It took way longer to authorize it than normal but it, I double checked to make sure the authorization was in are system, it was so I let them in.

This morning I come in and the night auditor tells me the guest in room A said he found fleas in the room and was getting bitten all night, so the night auditor moved him to room B. He calls down again saying this room has fleas too. He was offered to move again but I guess decided against it. I've worked here for over 6 years, we're not a pet friendly property, we've never had fleas. Neither of these rooms had guests use them in days, I don't see how they could have gotten there. Unless of course he brought them in, but of course we can't accuse someone of that. Turns out it didn't come to that though.

I told him I would have to have my head of housekeeping to inspect the rooms. I phoned her and asked her to come in early because at this point he was phoning down to the desk every 10 minutes. She comes in, doesn't find anything in room A, goes to room B and doesn't find anything. She and the driver (I guess they went together) said he kept trying to show them all these bites he had but he didn't seem to have any. She also brought down this little black speck he said was a flea. It just looked like a speck, no discernible legs or anything and wasn't moving. I could kind of see how it might look like a flea but it wasn't moving at all.

So at this point he goes into the classic song and dance of how he used to work for a hotel, he knows we're in cahoots and that we're lying. Additionally he accused me of calling him a liar, and I've long since learned never to do that. I told him I can't account for why he felt like like he'd been ravaged by fleas, I only know the hotel isn't responsible for it. Multiple times he tries to get me to say I'm calling him a liar but I don't.

Next interesting bit, what I didn't know is that when head of housekeeping looked in room A she found that the fire alarm had been taken off the ceiling, batteries taken out, and towels shoved under all the doors, and a condom under the bed. Next time he called down I brought that up to him and he denied, said room was like that when he came in. 

Next it was he's calling corporate (I already sent them a form explaining what happened ahead of time) he's gonna take pictures call all these people blah blah blah. I told him if he had pictures of the fleas this would all be settled, please take the pictures, then moved away from that and said he's going to call his wife, who's a lawyer. That is why I mentioned the condom, I'm sure this is more bullshit but I figured his wife would be very interesting in finding out we found a condom in a hotel room he was staying in without her. I'm keeping that ammunition in my back pocket for now.

His next phone call down, he's back on to calling corporate so I offer to give him corporate's number, which he takes. After some more back and forth with the same shit I tell him I'm losing patience with this and I'm going to have to let him go. here's where he accuses me of racial discrimination, not once has race come into it, this always tells me they know they're doing something shady.

Penultimately he brings a towel down with a few more little specks. don't look like fleas, none of them moving. Head of housekeeping and I look at them, again, don't look like fleas. SO he says he's calling 911. Housekeeper says go ahead. He goes back to his room and the switchboard is showing three 911 calls coming from the room, I assumed they told him this wasn't a police emergency. Maybe they don't him to call non emergency but I don't even know what they'd do.

Lastly he left his phone in the room because of course he did, something always has to happen to drag this sort of shit on forever. I call the first room and say he can pick up his phone but he has to leave. Luckily he came down for the phone, mumbled some more nonsense, and left without further incident. Of course that other couple is still here, I decided not to kick them out since they didn't cause any trouble but I'm sure there's going to be more tomorrow.

"A few months ago I booked a non refundable night at a hotel in Bristol UK.  Something came up and the receptionist was kind enough to move the date forward a week, she did not have to do this.

I rang up the other day as we are on lockdown and spoke to the same lady and she said they were cancelling ip to the date I originally booked, not the following week. I got it.

I asked for the Managers name and email and she said 'he isn't going to tell you any different'.

"A man in his late forties (~) walks into my hotel, he has a much younger woman with him. He says to me that he has a reservation under his name, after going through the regular rigamarole (“Are you sure it isnt under another name?” “No.” So on and so forth.) I offer to make him a new reservation because he has no confirmation email, and there is no real sign that his reservation ever existed. When I ask for his card he says “Oh we’re paying cash.” I point to the sign that says we do not take cash at check in. He says “well every other motel does,” despite it being a hotel and not a motel.

I ensure them that it they put down a credit card they can switch it to cash in the morning, they finally say “Okay, but we just put money in there and it might not have cleared” (like I haven’t heard that one before, buster).

His lady friend pulls out her card, and I recognize her name because the original reservation was under her name. After deleting the half-made new reservation, and getting back to the original reservation, I notice that her card already failed to authorize $1 (which is automatically authorized at the hotel to ensure the card is good to hold the room). Great.

It becomes apparent that the card isn’t going to authorize for the total amount so I say that it they can pay me cash for the room and tax then I can just take the card for the incidentals (let’s call it a good deed for the day). Their card didn’t even authorize for the fifty, so I had to ask them to seek accommodations elsewhere.

Despite how many times I told them that I simply couldn’t do it, they kept saying “come on man,” “help me out,” until eventually asking when I get off and promising to “make it worth my while at 12 o’clock.” Holding back tears of laughter, I refused (as gracefully as I could). And then they proceeded to crap on me and the hotel and ask to speak to a manager. I told them that they would just have to leave because no manager was there and they wouldn’t say anything other than “leave” if they were there.

"A quick bit about myself: I spent approximately 17 years in the hospitality industry and have worked just about every position in the industry. In 2019 I decided to leave the industry for the much less chaotic job of a 911 Dispatcher. In the time I was in the industry I've seen a few things; as I'm certain most of you have. The following are my stories.

In this time of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty I felt it best to start off with a bittersweet story of how not all guests are horrible monsters:

Before I get too deep into the story, let me make a quick description of our room types. All in all nothing out of the ordinary, we had the standard kings and double queens. The exception to this would be the hospitality/suite rooms we had. These were simply a living room set up, with a hot tub, own bath, wet bar, and a pull out sleeper sofa; it did have the mini fridge, coffee maker, and TV. These rooms usually were not sold by themselves, they usually went along with the connecting king room. Although, in a pinch when occupancy was high we were to rent these out at RACK.

At the time this took place (or started) I'd probably been working in the industry no more than 3 months and was probably just finishing up my first month of night audit. I worked at a fairly busy downtown location that almost always had 100% occupancy on the weekends and no less than 85% on weekdays. One of the reasons we always had such a high weekday occupancy was that this location was contracted out with the local VA hospital for anyone that was traveling away from home for treatments and wasn't able to make it back home because it just wasn't feasible to make the commute.

It was normal for families of those VA patients to come in on weekends to visit them and stay at the hotel. They had a special rate that was quite a considerable bit less than RACK, however, this had to be booked in advance through the VA and could ""never"" be done at the desk for a walk-in.

In the short time I'd been in the industry I had seen that most of the guests I'd be dealing with were quite needy and arrogant individuals that seemed to view front desk staff as some sub-human species below their lofty standard; I thank the rewards program for helping foster this environment, but that's a rant for another day. 

The night our tale starts was a ridiculously busy weekend and for once I'd had all my arrivals checked in that night before I even began my shift at 11pm that Friday night, and as a bonus there were no departures or arrivals scheduled for the following Saturday so that implied it would be a relatively stress free weekend. I did however, have one empty room that I was instructed to sell at full price. It was one of the hospitality/suite rooms. So the night has progressed to 2am and not a soul has ventured into my doors, that is until this extremely tired and frazzled looking woman and her family (2 teens and husband) walked in with their baggage. She was in town to visit her father who was at the VA, apparently he was staying with us but his health took a turn for the worse and he was moved from the hotel to the hospital. She says they need a double at the VA Family rate. Internally I prepare for the confrontation when I explain that we only have the hospitality/suite room available and I can't do the VA rate.

I explain to the lady what we have available and the rate I have to charge because of policy. Instead of her arguing or trying to frighten me into lowering the rate and making  a double room appear out of thin air. She is surprisingly understanding and says she knows it's last minute and she should have booked through the VA but she was just so frazzled with rushing to get down here. She agrees to the rate (if memory serves me it would have been $40-$60 above VA Family Rate) and the room type I have available for the weekend; the only thing she asks for is some extra pillows and bedding to make pallets for the children on the floor. I have security get those up to the room. 

On Saturday, shortly after I start my shift, the lady comes down and wants to thank me for getting them a room and being hospitable. Once she leaves the desk I don't think much more of it, and I am fairly certain that I won't have to come back to this situation.

Well, for the next several months the lady (sometimes alone and sometimes with her family) becomes a regular every weekend because her dad isn't doing well. Every weekend the reservation is made in advance and through the VA; if I'm not the one that checks them in she always makes a point of stopping by the front desk to say hello and talk for a little bit about things.

I ended up taking a mini-vacation and going to see some friends about 8 hours away. I come back to my first audit shift and there is an envelope waiting for me behind the desk. Inside is a letter from the lady saying that her father had passed away, and thanking me for always being there behind the front desk with a smile and a kind word from the first night they showed up. With the letter was a $100 gift card to Applebees.

I learned a valuable lesson that night: that the little kindnesses and things we do working the front desk may not matter to most of our guests, and most of our guests may not appreciate us, but there are those few that truly appreciate the hospitality we offer and it does have an impact on their lives.Not All Guests Are Monsters (Karens)",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

**Me**: ""... Hello, and welcome! Sure, we have rooms available. Due to the current situation you're in luck, I can offer you a standard room for EUR 80,- inkl. breakfa...""

**LDL**: ""YEAH I know, I own a travel agency, I know everything.""

*HS stands behind her and smiles at me sheepishly*


**Me**: ""Alrighty, lovely to have you here. I'll need a credit card for auth...""

**LDL**: ""YEAH I know that now let me just see I'm not sure there's enough money on this card because you know we just went skiing and they tried to charge it but it didn't work because it's a prepaid card but maybe there is enough on it now oh no i forgot I bought some beer on the train blablablablabalbabalbalbalablabablablablabalababl""

**Me**: ""Um, yes, let's just see if I can authorize the card and if that doesn't work we'll see what we can do"" (on a day like this I'll just take her passport as deposit if her card is declined and she manages to pay the room upfront) 



*Meanwhile to get things over with I try to involve HS by making him fill in the registration form, all the time she is still trying to explain to me why her card might be declined (the authorization went through...)*



After a nerve wrecking 20 minute check-in, trying to explain the hotel to them 
(Me: ""breakfast is served from 6am to ...""

**LDL**: ""I KNOW I KNOW"" 

**Me**: ""the WIFI is calle..."" 

**LDL**: ""YEAH I KNOW, where do I find breakfast?""   UGH) 



I finally get them going. 



On the way to the elevator, she spots the bar.

""OH MY"", I hear a cry of delight, as she beelines towards the bar, suitcases left to in the middle of the lobby, and she orders two beers and two Schnaps and proceeds to torture the next poor soul with stories that serve only to numb whatever goes on in her brain.


This, and the fact that she basically has the whole hotel to herself, sets the stage for dear LDL. She basks in the spotlight and the echo of our empty lobby as she tells everyone EVERYTHING. HS meanwhile sits at the bar quietly and drinks his beer and Schnaps.


Three more rounds in, during which I've taken their luggage and moved it towards the bar near them, she spots me again. My name unfortunately happens to be popular in the area she's from, so she calls me the pet name version of it.

**LDL**: ""JANSCHKI, dear! How old are you?""

**Me**: ""28..""

**LDL**: ""Oh. Well, it doesn't matter. I've got a very handsome son, he won't mind. He's a very famous ice hockey player where I'm from! AND he's in politics! Always travelling! Such a beautiful man. Wait, WAIT! I'll show you on facebook""



Not like I can just leave lady, don't you worry, I'll be here to admire that beautiful son of yours.


She actually RUNS to HS and starts searching the jacket he is still wearing for a phone, commands him to unlock it, and runs back to me. The facebook profile photo of her son is him in a suit, crossed arms, blurry blue-greyish background, edges around the head far too crisps which screams Huawei portrait setting, and a very, veeeeeery stern look directly into the camera. Beard attempted to be kept well but unfortunately the kind that is better shaved off.



""Mhm, wow, beautiful man, that."", I say. ""You must be very proud of him.""

**LDL**: ""WHAT'S YOUR FACEBOOK I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM""



And this is where I pretend to suddenly have SO MUCH to do in the back office. I apologise and duck whenever I see her next.. In one day they managed to rack up a bill of over EUR 400,- - which is great, however charging the authorization with that amount got declined and they weren't able to stay the 9 days they'd initially planned... They left three days after, during which I ducked and hid every time she came around. She tried to get my phone number from my colleague even. 

Just, what.

The three guests we had since were just as straining as this couple, but these are stories for another day. 

I hope all of you got to keep your jobs too in this time of crisis - my day-to-day routine at work is mind-numbingly boring, but bear in mind it's us who still get paid to pretty much do nothing.

"Hi ya'll, this will be my first post on here, so bare with me if I mess up anything. But I wanted to share a rather interesting experience I just had just two nights ago. Also, my sincerest apologizes as this might be a rather long post, I just want to give out as much detail as possible, TLDR will be at bottom.

I was covering the desk from 3pm to 11pm in an area that we unfortunately have a huge wave of homelessness. That night it was just my maintenance guy and I. The hotel is laid out to where the front desk is right next to the front door and our 24/7 business center is to the FD's right, but to the point to where anyone who's using it can see us and not us see them.

It was around 10:30pm when I had my maintenance guy walk in through the front door and right behind him was a guy who looked relatively young, but put together. He came up to me and asked me that he needed a room.

Him: Hey, I need a room for tonight.

Me: Hi, I can definitely help ou-

Him: I need you to help me with rates, because money is tight due to the Coronavirus...

Me: My sincerest apologizes, however the lowest rate I am able to offer on property level is $89. You are able to possibly book a lower rate onl-

Him: You don't have a credit card that I can sign up with?

Me: Um, unfortunately we do not have a credit card you are able to sign up with.

Him: Okay, do you have a business center that I am able to use?

(I was reluctant to let him use ours, as we have an issue of homeless individuals trying to pass time on the computers. Not that I have a particular issue with it, but we need to have them open for in-house guests.)

Me: Um, we do, however there is a time limit of fifteen minutes for non-guests, as we have to have them available for our guests!

The guy walks off and starts login onto what looked like Twitter and Discord, and was typing away. It was about 10:40pm whenever he began using it, and I was keeping time to make sure he was out of here before night audit came in. As I did not feel comfortable with the idea of having my night auditor be right next to him. Well, he has been typing away, time went by and both myself and my maintenance guy were just waiting for him to leave.

Night audit gets here at 11pm, my maintenance guy tells the guy that time's up and that we will need to start heading out.

Him: I STILL HAVE TIME LEFT, DO NOT BE AN INSENSITIVE JERK, I NEED A ROOM RIGHT NOW AND YOU ARE NOT HELPING WITH THAT. I AM EXPOSED TO THE CORONAVIRUS OUT THERE AND YOU ALL PROBABLY HAV-

Night auditor, maintenance guy, and I all told him to not talk to us and to leave otherwise we will be calling the authorities to come take him out. He kept typing. Maybe five minutes later, my maintenance guy told him to get out. The guy starts packing his small bag and picked up his Dr. Pepper bottle and started walking towards the door.

Him: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ALL HAVE THE CORONAVIRUS AND WILL BE DEAD SOON. YOU WILL KNOW HOW IT FEELS SOON. HOPE YOU GUYS DIE.

Me, without any hesitation: Okay, thank you, you have a good night.

I guess that triggered him enough to chug his Dr. Pepper bottle towards the front desk and hit our wall. He got out and as soon as we had him out we locked the doors, which perfect timing, because it sounded like he was going to come back inside for him to give up.  And he left.

**TLDR: Young homeless guy could not afford to get a cheap room. Used the business center for a bit, was overstaying his welcomed time. Got mad that we asked him to leave. Wished death upon closing staff, and hoped we got Corona.**Corona is going to kill you all!!!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Okay, okay. Second one I'm submitting today but I've got the day off and can't go out because of self-isolation so.. Here goes the number one worst shift I have ever had, it still makes me feel sick and my blood boil.

Again, I'll set the scene. 

The hotel I work at recently bought up a huge gym right next door to turn into conference rooms and a bigger breakfast area, so we've got construction work in the house, much to the dismay of many of our guests. This will be important later.

This was just before the whole Corona-madness reached its full stage, we were already getting in more cancellations than bookings but occupancy was still at like 60%. Because we give 90% of our free rooms to a local airline in case of layovers, and they'd been needing our free rooms every night on a very spontaneous basis, my previous three late shifts had been an absolute nightmare. I was working alone and it was, just, well let's say the day before this one I had to leave around 30 guests at the front desk for 5 minutes to go into the back office and cry a little bit before I was able to continue.

And then comes day zero.

I walk into work, already feeling queazy because I've got a feeling this day will be just like the ones before. 

It's monday and on mondays we always have a big group of wealthy ederly couples coming in. Honestly, my bosses were just out for the money there, these people belong into (and pay for) a 5* hotel and not a 4* like us, but it is what it is. Their group rates are insane, and of course with that money come the (mostly reasonable!) demands. 

We have no porters. We *do not* offer porterage. Only for this group, and the porters are whoever the fuck is available at the time. The bus drivers normally bring the luggage of this 70 people group while the guests are out sightseeing, which gives us some time to drag these bloody 30kg suitcases to the rooms. When I start my shift, our trainee and one of my colleagues have almost finished with the porterage And then

 the fire alarm starts.

*WEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEO*

Because our construction workers had a habit of setting of all kinds of alarms by accident, I wasn't worried. I called our maintenance manager and still in a good mood said ""yo, Chris, alarm's on again, could you check it out pls?"" and in our joking demeanour he goes ""yo sure thing"".

*WEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEO*

20 minutes later, alarm's still going. Fire brigade is here by now, can't reach maintenance anymore. At some point during a fire alarm, the elevaters get shut off automatically. Of course. And also, of course, we still have 8 suitcases in the lobby to bring up to the rooms. 

We figure, hey. This can't take too long. We'll take them up when the fire alarm has stopped. 

I go outside to speak with the fire brigade and the dude giggles and says ""yeah there's no fire but an alarm was set off nonetheless and we can't turn it off until we know where it came from, all the construction guys are just saying *it wasn't me* so we need to find the source""

*WEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEOWEO*

Fucking great, my ears are already ringing. Guests are panicking, do we need to evacuate, omfg. The lobby is full. Everyone's running around like headless chicken, with no sense of where they want to go, and our 16yo trainee with the social skills of a sea urchin tries to calm people down by hyperventilating and saying things like ""there's a system failure"". But I have no time to rescue our guests from her blabbering, because in just that second, the group of elderlies arrive. The bus driver fucking honks at one of the fire trucks to move so they don't have to walk 15 meters to the entrance of the hotel. Gawd. 

I go back inside, to find an additional alarm has started going off. The firefighters need to access the area through the staff entry, and that door rings a separate alarm when it's open for too long. We couldn't close the door because they needed to get in and out all the time. The alarm goes

*DINGDONGDINGDONGDINGDONG*

So this amounts to

*WEOWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

The tour guide of this group comes into the lobby, I don't recognise her so she must be new. I try to initiate our relationship on a light-hearted note and say ""well these alarms just never come at a good time, huh""

With not even a hint of a smile she glares at me with ice cold blue eyes and says ""well does it have to be right now?""

Like.. Oh, you wanted me to turn this off? Gosh, if only you'd told me earlier! Stupid cow.

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

And I said ""well, we're all hoping it won't take too long, you don't have to worry - there is no fire, it's a false alarm and we just need to figure out where it's coming from.""

Then we go through the whole procedure of 

**Me**: Do you have a list of everyone's passport number and the group voucher for me?

**Guide**: Yes somewhere but I'll give it to you later, just give me the room keys now, I don't have time for this!

*sigh*

**Me**: I'm sorry, we've had guides forget to hand in both which put us into some trouble, I would kindly ask you to give them to me now and then you can be on your way. 

Guide huffs and puffs and ""in NO hotel do I have to do this, who do you think I am, criminal, bladibladibla""

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

The whole group are by now in the lobby, tortured facess turned towards the ceiling trying to find the source of the awful noise, other guests are still coming to the front desk in panic, my two colleagues from the early shift are out of uniform already but kindly stepping in to help with the chaos.

We get this shit over with and I direct her attention to the fact that the elevators still aren't working and we still have a couple of suitcases down here, perhaps we could invite the whole group for a drink on the house? 

It's super cold and super windy outside, we can't even direct this group outside. It's an absolute disaster. They all decide to *walk* up to their rooms in the 5th and 6th floor. Of course, they demand the remaining suitcases to be taken up as well.

I snatch one of my colleagues from the early shift and place them at the front desk, apologizing all the way to everything and everyone I come in contact in because, still, during all of this it goes 

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

So, trainee and I get to work. Both of us girls, we take two really fucking big suitcases each and slowly, step by step, drag them up to the rooms while the guests belonging to these suitcases walk behind us and quietly, though loud enough for us to hear, mutter and complain about the noise. 

**YEAH WELL I FUCKING ENJOY THIS SITUATION** I think, and say in between coughing and panting with exhaustion ""well you'll have quite a story to tell at home, huh.""

They don't laugh, of course, but stop muttering at least.

Arrived on the 6th floor, it continues. One lady from the group comes storming out of her room as I'm currently rooming the guests whose suitcases were still at the front desk, and she tells me there's a piece of luggage in her room that isn't hers. 

So, I take that one back downstairs with me. And no, of course the elevators weren't working by then, and no of course it wasn't a gym bag but another 20kg heavy stupid fucking two wheeler with one crooked wheel that drags the whole thing to the right and **WHY DON'T YOU INVEST IN A PROPER FUCKING SUITCASE IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS OMFG**

argh

I'm just re-living the situation, sorry for virtual emotional outbursts.

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

I come back downstairs, the gentleman whose suitcase ended up in the wrong room was already there, he was on the 5th floor. He tried to say ""let's just wait until the elevators work again"" but then that bitch of a tourguide chirps in and says ""oh, Mr.blabla, don't say that! Let the girl work!""

So, internally swearing to poop into the tourguide's bed or something, I carried it back up for him. 

There I found some people who read the numbers on their key card holders wrong and tried to get into the wrong rooms because the 4 kinda looked like a 6. And then I found one couple ENTERING a wrong room because our trainee had re-coded the room keys without checking if it was the right number, so IN ADDITION to everything we now had two of this group standing in a completely unrelated guests room who filed a HUGE complaint about ""why the fuck can random people enter my room"" - it was so, so bad

BUT IT'S NOT OVER

I come back downstairs, again almost crying, when another gentleman of this group comes to the front desk and without any polite introduction tosses his key card holder onto the reception and says

""give me a different room""

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

I was so sweaty out of the corner of my eye I could see one of my strands of hair dripping.

**Me**: ""Sir, what's wrong with your current room?""

**Him**: ""Well I wasn't inside, but I want one on a higher floor""

**Me**: ...............................................................................................
let me just check what I have available. 
Okay, so I could either offer you a room in a lower category on the 6th floor, equipped with a queen-size instead of the king-size bed your current room offers, or I could offer you a suite on the 7th floor for an additional fee of EUR 45,- / night. 

**Him** *reads my nametag* : Janschki, you look like such a competent woman. And funny thing about computers, somehow they manage to magically show you things you didn't see before. Look again. You will find a way to give me the suite for free. 

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!?

**Me**: Sir, I have given you all the options. 

**Him**: Well then I will not stay here. I am serious. 

*WEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONGWEODINGWEODONG*

Never in my life have I wanted to tell someone to just fuck right off so badly. 

**Him**: Also, there are two russian ladies in our group, I think in the whole chaos they were in our room. The room is contaminated now, I don't feel safe in it. Give me the suite for free. 

(This was pre-Corona awareness, he was being plain racist)

All of this with a very calm voice and an unbearable smirk on his stupid face

**Me**: No.

Well, I won't make this any longer. He threw a fit, my boss told him to behave or GTFO, and in the end his tour guide paid for the upgrade to the suite out of her own pocket just so he would shut the fuck up. During the last bit, the alarm finally stopped and the elevators got working again.

So, get this. This entitled son of a bitch actually got what he wanted. He got a room upgrade, didn't have to pay for it, for no other reason than ""just because he can"". 



Apologies for the long post but man, it feels good to have it written down and out of my mind.

Edit:

**TL;DR two different alarms go off, elevators stop working, meanwhile large group of well paying guests arrive, trainee and I need to carry heavy suitcases up to the 5th and 6th floor several times, come down, some dickhead decides he doesn't like his room even though he hadn't even been inside, gets a free upgrade after he makes such a fuss that his tourguide pays for it, all of this while both shrill alarms are still ringing**

Also I feel the need to point out, except for the dick at the end, there are no wrongdoers here on the side of the guests. The guests have a right to expect their suitcases to be brought up to their rooms and be upset about the alarm. The tourguide had a rough day with a tough group. We were unable to stop the fire alarm, and all in all this only lasted for about 1,5 hours. What WAS a fuck up on our end was putting suitcases in the wrong rooms, recoding room keys without checking the room numbers, like oh my fucking god a NIGHTMARE. Unfortunately we were able to trace all of that back to our trainee... But she is only 16, and again, no social skills so she gets extremely worked up really fast until her brain sort of overloads and shuts down. We did damage control on all the guests that were affected, anything else would be highly unprofessional.construction work + fire alarm + large group of elderly couples = the worst shift i've ever had.

" 

This just happened.

I checked in a guy with a bit darker skin and big beard to a dorm with 6 beds.

In less then 2 min. here comes Karen, runs up to reception and starts shouting to me while leaning in my face, that how dare I check in another person in her room. With the Covid19, that's not safe, she doesn't want's to die, blabla.

Like leaning in my face while shouting is very safe right? She wouldn't get a private room cause "" This place is empty anyway because of the virus so you can put everyone in a different room. ""

We have certain policies of course, that every room is allowed to have half of the amount of people. So in 6 bed 3 people, in 8 bed 4 and so on. Also 2 of our floors are closed down.

I got so pissed, first of all who the hell asked her to travel right now? If she's so concerned, why not take a private room?

I got so angry, I was literally shaking. I wanted to punch her in the face. I'm a reasonable person, I almost never loose my cool, but somehow this type of people can make me go feral. 

Guess what was my solution? 

The guy I checked in came downstairs while Karen was still shouting, to ask me something. So in front of Karen, I offered him to get moved to a nice, spacious private room for free. Karen was just getting redder by the moment,then she said: ""great I'm happy he's out of my room"" and then run away.

"Hey there hi there ho there! I'd say I hope tonight finds us all well but we all know the deal. Shit sucks, people are panicking, and things seem to be only getting worse. But tonight's tale is not about the looming shuttering a lot of us fear.

No, rather, tonight's tale is about a family in hiding, an unknown car in my parking lot, and the power of friendship. No, seriously, friendship comes into play here, in a big way.

We all know the story when a woman and her kids show up at 4 am begging for an anonymous room. With her fresh restraining order in hand, we fell all over ourselves to make sure they're safe and sound. This is something that I know we all take seriously, but having grown up in one of those types of environments, I take it doubly so. My 4 cell mag light feels even stronger about these situations than I do. That doesn't matter though, just an aside.

The family has been with us for a few days now, and has been a pleasure to interact with even with everything going on in their lives and the world in general. It also doesn't hurt that she is literally 1 of 12 rooms I currently have in-house. So, you can imagine my feelings when she calls me a few hours ago worrying about a car parked directly in front of her room. I threw the sign on the desk, grabbed my flashlight, and made tracks.

Immediately, I found the car she was worried about, and made contact. Initially I assumed it was one of the umpteen million local down and outters trying to find a quiet place, so I treated it as such. Well, I did up until he told me, specifically, ""I'm waiting for that woman to come out of her room, she'll be out in 5 minutes."" She is also literally the only person on that section of the property.

I'm sure each and every one of you hears the alarms bells. Gears switch immediately, I choke up on my flashlight (I wanted him to feel threatened, ngl) and told him that he needed to leave right now. He started to argue but I already had my phone out pretending to dial 5-O. Obviously he bails out, never to be seen again.

Or so I thought. A little while later, I noticed him circling in the lot next to ours, or a very similar make and model. He's off property, so I have no say here, but you can be damned sure I will be keeping an eye on it. Fast forward to audit time, when I get the beast rolling, and go to take another property walk. This time, I notice the car is gone. But wait no, no it isn't, he has merely moved to parking in the gas station parking lot.

Here comes the power of friendship. The lady who works the place during the graves and I have known each other for roughly 10 years, and have a great rapport going. Suddenly, I need a Redbull and a chat. So I yet again toss up the sign and mosey my way across my lot to hers to make my purchases. I very clearly pointed him out to her (I know he saw me doing this) and told her what was up. She looks towards the car with clear disgust on her face.

I return to the lobby and continue about my close out. A few minutes later, red and blues catch my eyes. I glance over towards the gas station and who should I see being frisked but the guy I pointed out. After a couple minutes, one of the officers came over and I filled him in on my experiences, as well as let him know that she had an active restraining order against him.

Yeah, guess who is currently sitting in a holding cell somewhere outside of Los Angeles?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should mention that I wanted to move her right then and there, but she chose to stay put due to her kiddo being asleep. Needless to say, she's getting a super swanky upgrade tomorrow to put her closer to the lobby and inside the courtyard instead of on the exterior, and I have stepped up my patrols from once an hour to every 30 minutes.

"Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post here and I figured id share with you one of my craziest stories from working the front desk since I'm not currently working due to the hotel shutting down from the COVID-19.

So it was a slow night and we only had about 200 checking in that day but it was 10pm so there were maybe 15 left. I work at a high end ski resort in PA and have to deal with the snotty people all the time but this just takes the cake. When a family of husband, wife, and 2 older children but not teens yet came up. My supervisor was sitting at the computer behind the desk working on the schedule so it appeared I was the only one there and I was 18 at the time so I assume these guys thought they could push me around, not knowing I don't take crap from people.

&amp;#x200B;

So when I ask the wife the last name she looks me up and down rolls her eyes at me and refuses to speak. The husband was pushing all the luggage in and she stood there until he was done. When he finally came up I got the reservation and they were on the cheapest room that was only the room, didn't include breakfast or anything.

As I'm checking them in this man has an attitude about everything I say. I explain that the package he is on does not come with breakfast but offer 2 options that will be available in the morning. He sees the tickets that are on the desk for the people that get breakfast and he tells me I need to just give to him. I explain I am not going to do that because he didn't pay for them (Honestly if people are really nice I do give them out but he was a total jerk.) I then explained that our valet was full and he could park anywhere off the loading ramp that did not say valet. He threw a big fit saying if there was not room in valet why would there be spots. I explained that people take their cars in and out so there may be an empty spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

He then looked at me and said ""So you expect me to walk back from my car?"" I honest to God thought this man was joking and I just said yes, the parking spots are just off the ramp, just the first when you loop around are valet but where he first pulled through is available. So his wife rolling her eyes stomped to the room and he parks the car and makes a scene coming in saying I should have valeted his car for free since it was full (??) I apologized and said that this late at night it is typically full since check in is at 3. 

He comes down like 5 min later with his two girls crying and demands tone put into the executive floor on slope side because he promised his girls. I explained that since his room is a lodge room the rooms go from floor 1-4 and to get on 10 is an upgrade. and since those rooms were almost completely filled it was like $88 plus tax a night. He got so mad at me saying I needed to do it for free because he had to park his own car. I told him I could not do that because that is a major upgrade and I could complementary upgrade him to a room on the 7th floor that is slope side and he just stomped away.

"I'm developing software for hostel chain with big city premises so spent a lot of time on site. This particular place the office with the computer was behind the front desk so I can see and hear everything that's going on.  


A lovely summer evening and a lot of the younger guests are hanging outside chatting, drinking coffee and so on. This guy comes storming into reception shouting that his expensive camera has been stolen from his room and how its our fault the security is so bad (shared dorm and we warn everybody not to leave valuables in the dorm and we can look after them). 

He's demanding we call the police and won't stop ranting. Receptionist is waiting for the manager to get there when two cops show up one carrying a camera. We're on friendly terms with the beat cops (no car they patrol the streets on foot), they often swing by for a coffee.

My Head HK informed me that they've been causing a lot of problems; the 3 kids were making HUGE messes in the room (throwing soda cans at the walls, emptying bags of potato chips on the floor and walked all over them, and HK had to deal with it each time), annoying our HK ladies, causing numerous noise complaints, etc.. She and I discussed putting a cleaning fee on their card when they check out, as well as not letting them extend, and I prayed to the hospitality gods that they wouldn't trash the room completely when they would eventually leave.

Fast forward to today. It's my first shift in a week (because of COVID 19). I check my system and they EXTENDED their stay for another WEEK. But that's not all. They switched to the room next door, 009, no credit card on file, but a freaking debit, and paid entirely cash. Who AUTHORIZED THIS?

Girlfriend came by and asked to check if they paid until Sunday morning. I take a look and it's only until Friday , so I inform her accordingly. She says no, I paid $XXX for 7 nights, until Sunday. I check her folio and its the same amount, but my system says only until Friday. She repeats the same thing, I tell her the same thing again. And again. Like 4 times. I swear she wasn't listening at all and was just like saying things just to say them. Eventually she says she'll go take a look at the receipt she got and leaves.

5 mins later, room 009 called. Lovely. I'm not a good writer and it's a long conversation so the guy will be TG, for Tough Guy, and I will be Me. Lack of punctuation to simulate the way TG speaks.

**Me:** Reception.

**TG:** Hello yes my girlfriend said we only paid through Thursday but we in fact paid for 2 more days.

**Me:** That's what it says in my system. If you would-

**TG:** That makes no sense because we paid that price thinking it was for 7 nights and not 6 *(his math is wrong???)* so why are you telling me that I only paid until Friday because that makes no sense and it's not our fault like I paid $XXX cash for this many nights.

**Me:** Right. It's very possible that the person who extended your stay made a mistake. Now if-

**TG:** But it's not fair because it's not our fault because it is yours. It's your fault that you messed up.

**Me:** Yes that is what I just said. However you still paid the correct amount for 6 nights. If you would like to extend until Sunday you just have to pay-

**TG:** I want to talk to a supervisor.

**Me:** There is no one else. Only me.

**TG:** No, I want to talk to a su-per-vi-sor. Now.

**Me:** There's literally no one to talk to. No one. Nobody. But me.

**TG** \[*raising his voice significantly\]*: NO BECAUSE WE PAID THAT AMOUNT IN CASH THINKING THAT IT WAS FOR UNTIL SUNDAY SO WE PAID IT BUT NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME I HAVE TO PAY MORE THAT IS YOUR FAULT AND NOT MINE.

**Me:** Yes we might have make that mistake, but you would have ended up paying the same amount anyway? The price is fixed. Again, if-

**TG:** NO BECAUSE IT IS YOUR FAULT THAT PAID THIS AMOUNT IN CASH I DONT WANT TO PAY ANY MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR 7 NIGHTS (math still wrong) DO YOU UNDERSTAND-

**Me** *\[I lost my patience here and raised my voice to get him to listen\]*: Listen to me for one minute and don't interrupt. I'm looking at your bills now. Since you had 008 and 009 there are two separate bills. The total is $XXXX. Is that right?

*\[child screeches in the background because you know, why not make me suffer more\]*

**TG:** WHY DID YOU SAY 2 BILLS THERE'S ONLY ONE ONLY ONE WE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE THE 11TH WE NEVER LEFT WHY ARE THERE TWO BILLS.

**Me:** It's just how the system works. I don't have the clearance to see all the details but I can take a look to see where the mistake might be-

**TG** \[*now yelling\]*: NO THIS IS YOUR FAULT AND I WILL-

I hang up. Bad move, unprofessional, I know. I just can't take anymore of the yelling and the stupidity.

They come over. I am prepared with both bills of both rooms. More of the same conversation as above happens thrice over. He doesn't even pretend to read the bills, and yells about how everything is wrong, that my computer is wrong (how can it be wrong, it's a computer with every single transaction logged), that I'm wrong, etc etc. You ever try to explain anything to a five-year-old throwing a temper tantrum?

Meanwhile their 3 kids in the background are jumping around, stomping, setting off the front door sensor over and over, knocking over plants, slapping the vending machine, setting my last nerves on fire. The girlfriend is standing right there not even bothering to control their own damn kids and pointing out useless shit like ""This bill isn't even in my name when I paid for it""; like girl your name isn't even on the reservation, the computer doesn't know who you are??? TG continues to yell and berate me and interrupts me everytime I try to say something. I feel nerves pop behind my eyes. Truly something our of a medieval painting. But not until TG says something that makes me completely snap.

""You know what? If you're *intelligent enough* to understand, which you're *not*\-""

Cue the fireworks.

""That's *IT*!!! ENOUGH WITH THE INSULTS. Out of my lobby, NOW! Go back to your room! I will no longer tolerate your attitude and insults! OUT!!""

I even slapped the counter with both hands - I've never slapped or punch any surfaces in rage before. I tell them they have 15 minutes to leave the premises. TG - aggravatingly - scoffs and refuses. I say that's my ground to call the cops because he is now trespassing. He says sure do it, he will EXPLAIN to them what happened with his payments. Like man this is not even about your payments, I'm gonna refund you anyway; you're getting trespassed because I'm evicting you due to the yelling and the insults. He is vaguely shocked, ""I never insulted you! I never said you were stupid or anything! Uh yes like 15 seconds ago.

What really hurts me though and enrages me to near is how he claps and says all sarcastically, ""Bravo on your performance,"" regarding my outburst. I just want this guy off my property, please.

While waiting for the cops to come, he harasses other guests that come to the lobby and showing them bis bills and making a scene. They all leave though. Then I hear him call his ""mommy"" on his cell. She then calls me at the front desk, very calmly saying that her son and his partner has kids and asking why I asked them to leave. I explain that he is very disrespectful and refuses to leave after I tell him to so I have no choice but to get the cops involved. She apologizes and says that she will talk to him. Very sweet sounding old lady. I hear him saying that ""I lied and made shit up because I'm incompetent"" to her on the phone 2 seconds later though. I feel bad for her.

The cops come. I explain to them what happened and they agree to have TG trespassed. He then has an argument WITH THE POLICE and it grows louder and louder, scaring my other guests who came to check out. ""But where will I go with the virus outside???"" Maybe if you thought about that before coming here to berate my existence, we wouldn't have that problem.

It finally gets through to him that he needs to leave. I will happily give him his money back so he'd get the fuck off my property.

There is just one teeeny tiny problem. He paid cash and does not have a credit card for the refund. Just the debit.

The cops can only have him trespassed from the property, but not his hotel room.

Lord end my suffering.

In the end, the cops walk them back to their room and they've been quiet since then. I type down what happened in the logbook and PRAYS that we do not extend their stay again. My FOM works tomorrow but he doesn't really have my back when it comes to things like this (I have stories of this if anyone's interested). I know TG will come tell him how much of a raging idiot I was.

I really regret how I lost my cool and said unprofessional things in the heat of the moment. I'd rather be fired over this than having to deal with guests like this again, but then again it's part of the job.

Did I mention they switched rooms because they broke one of the beds in 008? TG told the cops we gave him a broken bed but they were in there for days, the bed was fine last week and there's no HK because of COVID so nobody even came in there to break said bed for him. 🙃

**TL;DR:** Bad, extremely rude guest makes me scream and slap the marble counter. Cops were called. Can't evict him though because no CC. Lord beer me strength.No runni-yelling in my lobby!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guy just called me, pretending to be from ""technical support"" but the phone showed he was a wireless caller.  He claimed a part of our system was unresponsive and he needed me to download anydesk, from anydesk.com, so he could remotely access the system.  

At that point I asked for a ticket number so I could call our helpdesk for our system back.  He asked to verify our email and said he was sending an email with the number to call back.  I said I would just be calling the regular helpdesk number.   He then claimed to be from our ""brand"" technical support, not our ""system"" technical support, and said I needed to call the email number for that reason, and pushed me to open the email. (which I won't be doing)  

I asked again for the ticket number and he gave me one, with the correct lingo for our system.  I confronted him with the fact that caller ID showed him on a wireless, and he asked if I'd like him to call back from the ""brand"" telephone system.  Gee, you think?  Of course I would.  

He said he would do that, hung up, and has not called back, lol.

This all sounds super obvious when it's typed out like this, but the scammer was really smooth and even had the typical sounds of a busy call center in the background.  So I figured someone probably needed to hear it tonight.

"I had a guest email about a charge on his card for $250. I know right away what the charge is for so I respond that the guest smoked in the room and was therefore charged the smoking fee as per our website states.

Almost a month later I receive a follow up email from him that he wants to be refunded because he was under the impression that we gave him a smoking room since that was what he requested and no one told him it wasn't. No where in his reservation does it say he wanted a smoking room, no where on our website does it state we have smoking rooms, and there is a nice sign on both automatic doors as you walk in stating this is a smoke free hotel. 

I even sent him the link from the company website stating that all hotels under the brand are non-smoking as of 2006.

His final response was that he was filing a chargeback and getting his money back. Dude just admitted in the email that he smoked in the room! I can't wait for that chargeback to come in so I can print the email and send it right back over, lol. 

People are so dumb.The tale of the guest who smoked in the room, admitted it, and still demanded his money back",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"For context: our building has 2 enterances/exits for guests and a 3rd that is STRICTLY a fire exit. It is clear as day looking at it, too. The handle isn't a normal bar, it's a big gray box with electronics inside. In big red letters on the glass it says ""DO NOT OPEN, ALARM WILL SOUND"". The pathway to it also makes it painfully clear that this isn't an exit guests should take (it's all the way in the back of the restaurant behind the booths). At night, we lock the front doors and guests need their keys to enter/exit. We hang signs that read ""please use the left side door to exit"" with an arrow pointing directly to the left. The side door is literally right next to the main entrance. You can see it without even needing to turn your head.

Anyway, cue this dumbass who came through the lobby around 3am. He walks up to the door and damn near smacks his head on it. He then backs up and gets this puzzled look on his face. He ponders every decision hes ever made for a good 10 seconds and THEN sees the sign. I hear him mumble to himself ""side door"" and he walks away. I was confused because, as I already said, the door is literally DIRECTLY next to it with a sign on it that says ""SIDE DOOR"". He clearly wasn't drunk or inebriated in any way so I just let him carry on.

After I had a second to think, I realized this idiot was walking towards the fire exit, in the complete OPPOSITE direction the signs pointed. I ran after him, hoping he wasnt dumb enough to use it but oh boy, did I underestimate his supreme dumbassery. Right as I came around the corner, he opened the door and the building alarm went off. My heart immediately sank. He just looked at me with a deer-in-the-headlights kind of look. All I said was ""man you really couldn't read the sign? We have arrows pointing to the correct door and it says right there that the alarm will sound if you open this one.""

He didnt even try to say anything. He just asked if he was in trouble. I told him I wouldnt be the one to say and management would follow up with him in the morning. I got his name, told him where the correct door was, and he was on his way. The fire department had to come, sirens blaring, to reset the alarm. All while guests were coming down and I was reiterating that it was a false alarm. Needless to say, we got a lot of complaints that night and the following morning. My management never punished the guy, never even bothered to call him.

*I was in the middle of the audit so I didnt think to explain it to him when he was very obviously confused. I know I should have and, I'll admit, sometimes it's fun to watch them squirm. Especially when its 3am and it's easier to get away with being unhelpful. This one came back to bite me in the ass but its still that idiots fault for not being able to read*

"So this just happened last night. I'm currently covering a few night audit shifts because this whole Covid-19 thing has changed everything about the flow of our hotel...


Anyway, last night I get a call. Started out fairly normal, guy wants to know our availability for some future dates. He was one of the chatty ones though - you know the type, has to tell you their life story before getting to the point of why they're talking to you?


Tells me that he's looking to bring his daughter on a trip to get out of the snow, they usually take about 4 ""daddy-daughter"" trips per year but haven't had any yet this year... Alright, whatever.


Asks how the shopping is in our town because she loves shopping and he loves spending his money on her. Ok, whatever. I let him know that most of our shops are independently owned and because of this whole Covid-19 thing, I have no idea how the shopping is going to be. 


Then he feels the need to tell me that he became a father super young - he's only 34 and his daughter is 19, he tells me to ""do the math"". Ooookaaaaay. Still wondering why I'm being told any of this. First red flag goes off in my mind.


Goes on about how they pick a new place to travel to by spinning a bottle on a map and going to wherever it lands. Cool, whatever.


Tells me about how much money he loves spending on her shopping, how they buy so much stuff they end up having to have it shipped back home and how much fun they have unpacking things in the weeks that follow as they remember all the things they bought as they arrive... Alrighty, again, what does this have to do with me? 


Tells me about how because he's only 14 years older than his daughter, they look more like siblings and that they're just ""different"". ...um.....ok?


Tells me about them going on a beach trip when she was 15 and how she bought a couple of bikinis, but then when they got back home later and the boxes of stuff arrived she bought like 23 bikinis! ...ok, this is getting really creepy. What is going on?


Brings up their age difference again and how they have a ""different"" kind of ""daddy daughter"" relationship again. I'm getting super creeped out and just doin' the professional, I don't care at all, ""Ok""


Then his tone changes... ""Oh. I think you'd get along with my daughter. She always said she'd want to meet someone who approves of our type of relationship. We'd have to take you shopping!"" Um, wut? When did I say I ""approved"" of anything? What the fuck is going on??

Asks if I know what he means by their ""type of relationship"" and I promptly inform him that I have NO idea what he's talking about, and he changes tone again, ""oh you know, shopping...anyway, are you closer to my age or her age?""


Fuckin' red flags sprouting up everywhere, I have to end this call. I wanted to hang up so many times but this was the final, creepiest straw. ""Look, is there anything else I can help you with tonight?"" 


""Oh, no, I just felt like I was on vacation already! You have a good night."" 


Blech. Finally got to hang that call up, but like, wtf?? Like, was I just talking to someone who was roundabout admitting that he has some kind of incestuous relationship with his daughter?! Was it all just some kind of DDLG thing? Were they trying to travel somewhere that they could pull someone into their weird shit? Did I just misinterpret the entire situation and it was actually ""innocent"" and this guy just doesn't know how to communicate properly??  No idea here, but I'm still creeped out and grossed out just thinking about it.Creepiest Call I've Taken in my 10 years of Desk Work",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"The title says it all but I'll go into detail as this is happening live. 

We had a housekeeper return to work today after being out sick with pneumonia. The same housekeeper received a call from their grandmother that they live with that she had just tested positive for corona virus. This housekeeper had already been through 15 rooms, which are now out of service. Every employee has been exposed and put at risk, there are people CHECKED INTO 2 of the potentially contaminated rooms. The manager, who is conveniently not here, tells every one there's no problem, no need to say anything to the guests at risk, expect us to stay here or be fired, and that the whole thing is blown out of proportion. He then goes on to say if they are tested positive then we may do something and that we should ""pay attention to our bodies.""

Said housekeeper also carpools with 2 other employees who are also out getting tested. One front desk team member who had been in direct contact with the infected was told by her parents and made the conscious decision to quarantine herself.

The manager talked her out of it. Lied to her and convinced her there is no problem at all and she wont get sick. 

I want to leave this place so bad and never come back but like everyone else I need money and don't have a back up job.

So it comes down to this, starve or risk exposure. Not an easy choice.

UPDATE#2 (First is in the comments.) I spent the whole shift there. Checked in 15 people. I currently have a headache and runny nose and a cough (no I don't think I caught it and developed symptoms in the course of 8 hours but....) If there was any way I did contract it, it was from the hotel as I'm already an antisocial hermit. The past 2 months I've only left the house for work and have (and generally do anyway) been ordering all my groceries and whatnot online. My normal amounts, not hoarding. Taking all the information you guys have given me I've decided to stick with my original plan for financial reasons since I'm probably already infected. I have a vacation coming up at the end of next week. I'm going to continue to monitor this literal death trap, report the necessary information to the department of health and the owners as soon as I can get in contact with them. There's one owner in particular who is a huge germaphobe and was actually at the property earlier in the day, he's also the most level headed of them all. He's the one I need to contact. After my vacation i will work the mandatory day after to recieve my vacation pay then promptly quit. And let me be clear, I don't like this job. I work in a verbally abusive environment from guests and GM alike. We get no recognition or thanks for the tireless hours we put in despite being constantly understaffed. Not many people stay working here long because of the lack of concern for employees. I've been called a saint for being there over a year working full shifts and weekends by myself. I've been compiling notes and testimonies this whole time from other employees as well as my own experiences and have been seeking out any legal action I can take. The place already has Bed Bugs on a weekly basis and now it seems it will have corona on the reg too. For any wondering just what hotel I work at, it's a place people go to for a fast Holiday. Except in my experience, it's been a torture chamber.An employee may have and has been exposed to Covid19. There's no reason to worry.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

There have been A LOT of Coronavirus posts on here lately, despite the fact that there is a pinned Coronavirus megathread at the top of the page. If you all have actual subreddit tales that involve the virus by all means post them separately. But we are getting too many ""we are getting laid off"" posts. I truly sympathize with all of you. I was just laid off on Thursday. It sucks and we are living in crazy times right now. But we are still a subreddit for Front Desk Tales.

I heavily encourage all of you to utilize the Coronavirus megathread for any future content. I'll personally monitor the notifications I get for posts being too short and approve them if necessary.

"Hey all, just discovered this sub reddit, and is my first time posting here, so please be kind. This is also a long, long story, so grab a drink, a snack, and a chair, and buckle up for this wild ride.

This story is two in one, it requires some info from a month ago so here we go...

A month ago, before this virus mess was a prominent feature for our line of work we were sitting at about 80% occupancy of a 200 room hotel. While I was doing my duties on the front desk (mind you, I am the MOD) I get a very urgent walkie from my night engineer. He says I need to get to a room, like, yesterday. I sprint to the room, which was thankfully the same floor as the desk, and find him at a HVAC unit with water shooting from it into the ceiling. He had broken the water pipe for it, due to rust (it's a very old hotel, almost 40 years) and this was an occupied room with a guests belongings in it. He runs to the shut off, and I was needed so I can let him know when the water stopped flowing.

 After this was all said and done, I moved all of the guest's belongings to the desk, and got ready to change his room. He just so happens to walk in at the moment, and starts screaming at my staff, wondering why his belongings were at the desk, and not in the room. I explained the situation to him, and he begins berating me about how I'm an idiot that shouldn't have touched his belongings without his permission (which is technically true, but I didn't want his electronics to be damaged by the water) He threatens to sue, and wants me fired on the spot, which isn't going to happen (I have an ego, but situations I have been in have given it to me) He finally goes to his room, and this is what I believe to be the end..... how wrong I was.

It is now March, amid this whole virus situation, which like many of you, has brought my hotel almost to a halt. I am an airport property, so we aren't closing anytime soon, as we have a lot of imports and exports from the nearby airport, which means staff stay with us. I get into work and head to the desk, when I hear screaming coming from there. I rush up, and who do I see than Mr. Flooded Room. He's going on and on about how he doesn't like the price, and that he could get it cheaper at any hotel nearby, which, there aren't any nearby, and that he should have it free because he had a flooded room last time he was here. He looks over and sees yours truly, and instantly gets red in the face, pretty sure he may have popped a gasket in his brain. 

He points at me, and starts saying how I shouldn't even be working here due to my ""monumental screw up"" last time. He then says I can make it up to him by making his stay completely free. I look at his reservation, and was prepared to at least give him a night free, mind you we had comped his whole stay last time, but I mean, comping an $80 room, yes, $80, wasn't a big deal. This dude was set to stay for 20 nights, apparently he works for the airport and they brought him in for some project they're doing. I am NOT comping a 20 night stay, especially with us having laid off almost all of our staff because of the world's state. I explain that I will happily waive two nights of his stay, but we're not doing the whole thing, and also, no hotel near us will offer him a lower rate than what he has, as it's an agreed rate worked out with our sales team. This causes him to go into a frenzy, spewing insults directed at me, and my team. He also says that because of the flooded room from last time, which he never set foot in once it flooded, that he got sick from it, and is more susceptible to the virus, yes, I rolled my eyes too.

I let him know that he needs to calm down, or our security team will escort him from the property...bad idea. He lunges over the counter at me, but slams his head into the computer that is bolted down to the desk, and cut his head open. Police and paramedics were called, and luckily our security is an ex-army medic so she was able to do a little patchwork for him. People are questioned, cameras are checked, and he is escorted off property by police, probably to a hospital for some stitches I imagine. So for those of you that assume my scary virus in the title is Corona, you'd be wrong, it is human stupidity, so please stay safe everyone, because this virus is only getting worse with the current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: A man's room is flooded due to a broken pipe, yells at everyone for moving his stuff, returns a month later upset about a rate he's paying, and tries to attack me, resulting in him cracking his head open, and being removed from the hotel.A flooded room, and a scary virus.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Today's the day. My final shift at my hotel. Three weeks ago, I put in my notice, just barely missing the furloughs that cropped up at my property this weekend. So tonight, with eight arrivals for an eight hour shift, I've been a little pensive. So now, I thought I'd share some stories that I've had happen here in the past few months. Most of these stories are somewhere here in TFTFD.

The first one deals with a flight crew. For those who don't know me, I'm a flight major at Randomcollege University. There's a company, Ameristar, that still flies McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, and that's the airplane I'd give my left nut to fly. Well, last July, Ameristar flew three of their four DC-9s into Randomcollege Airport on a freight run for Urabus. They'd stay for a couple days, then fly out and back to Laredo before coming back in. Well, one of the pilots noticed right away that I had a liking for that plane. Well, mostly because I noticed their company IDs and asked them if they'd flown in the three DC-9s I'd seen earlier. Right away he offers me the nickel tour of the planes. So the next day, I drive to the hotel and pick up this guy, we'll call him Harold, and another of the Ameristar guys, we'll call him Eduardo. We go out to the airplanes (small Class D field with next to no security and no SIDA requirement), and I get to sit in the cockpit of one of them and watch them taxi the airplanes around. There's nothing like a couple of Pratt and Whitney JT8Ds screaming at idle to wake you up. Those guys wound up staying at the hotel for about a week before leaving. Harold died about three weeks later, but he was about the nicest man I ever met while I was here.

The second one deals with a top-tier snowflake who wasn't a snowflake at all, but rather just a down-to-earth, genuine guy. About a week ago, this guy and his dog came into the hotel, and he was one of the YHG Speyere members. Now, with most Speyere members, I wind up getting a lot of crap because I work at a full-fledged Schmoliday Out, not a Schmoliday Out Fast and Big Rooms, and people aren't used to having to pay for breakfast or drinks, so I was bracing for it. But instead of coming down to berate me for a policy I had no control over, he instead struck up a conversation with me. I was a little surprised, but played along. Turns out the guy was doing some contract work and would come back to drink at the bar before heading up to his room. He'd booked the presidential suite and everything. The second night he was there, he came down to the desk and brought his dog down with him. Since she was a service dog but off duty, I got to pet her. She was the sweetest little fox lab. That stands out as one of the nicer guests I've had in a long time, and he was beyond refreshing.

The third one deals with the night I had to refuse service to someone who threw so many red flags it wasn't even funny. It was at the tail end of my shift and I was about to count my cash drawer when someone walked in. He seemed a bit, well, off. His eyes were sunken into his skull, and his skin was hanging off his bones. The east side of Randomcollegetown has a lot of meth heads, so I was instantly suspicious since they don't seem to have any fear of the police department right across the street. Red flag number one, but I figured I'd give him a shot since hey, I've been wrong before. Well, he comes in asking for the restrooms. Red flag number two. I tell him we don't have any for public use, and he switches and asks for a room. Red flag number three. I already know I'm denying him a room at my property since he's throwing off all the signs of someone just wanting to shoot up. So I give him the benefit of the doubt and ""search"" for available rooms. In the meantime, I ask for a credit card and a photo ID. He produces a debit card in someone else's name and a green state ID card, which is different from a driver's license. Red flags number four and five. And red flag number six happens when I see his hand is plastered in fresh blood. It was still oozing out of his hand. I look at him and tell him that due to a bunch of weddings in the area and a water main burst, we were sold out of what we had to give that night. He slinked away, and I never saw him again. There were a ton of kids in the hotel that night, and I wasn't about to put them in any danger.

The final one deals with the time I finally grew a pair and stood up for myself. Back in December, I had an Almyra Gulch of a woman call into the hotel and start complaining about something; I can't remember what it was. The story's buried in TFTFD somewhere. But after a while, I got tired of the woman's complaints and her attitude. When she pulled the age-old question of ""what are you going to do for me,"" I simply said that I would do nothing. And when she went on the how-dare-I-disrespect her, I told her that respect is earned, not given. She didn't like that too much, but I couldn't have cared less. I hung up on her after she started cussing. The details of this one might have shifted a little since it's been a while since it happened, but the main point is the same. It took about five months of being scared that I'd get fired for looking at a guest wrong before I got a pair and stood up for myself. And I'm glad I did.

So yeah. Those are the four highlights of the nine months I worked front desk at my 147-room ""premier"" downtown Schmoliday Out in Randomcollegetown, Indiana. The hotel is a crap hole, with understaffing, mismanagement, and maintenance and housekeeping issues, but it built me up from a no-balls weiner into the apatheic sumbitch I am today. So for that, Schmoliday Out, I say danke schön und auf wiedersehen.Looking Back on Nine Months",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is just some. I text for you guys before I get into the main story - so you can skip this part if you’d like! Recently with all the problems caused by Covid-19 we’ve had to close our restaurant for evening meals until further notice. This started before Mr Johnson made the mandatory restaurant/bar closures yesterday, so at this point some places were still open and serving food nearby - which was a blessing as it meant there were still places to get food nearby. 

Now for the tale of Mr Hangry.

He’d made a last minute booking online, but hadn’t provided the full card details online for us to charge - meaning that he’d needed to pay me on check-in. Surprisingly enough he was fairly calm about this. The drama starts when he’s told the restaurant isn’t open, just the bar behind reception for drinks. He asks to cancel his reservation... obviously we can’t refund him because he’s booked a hotel for the room, and not a table at the restaurant which is a bit different. He then gets on the phone to his *credit card company* asking to do a chargeback on the card because we don’t have a restaurant open and, funnily enough, they agree with us! 

This all goes underway before I get the chance to tell him about the various nearby restaurants that were serving food at the time of this. The first one I mention is my personal favourite because around the back of the pub part is a top-class Indian restaurant as well - but that’s met with rolled eyes because it’s a 15 minute walk from us. I completely forgot at this point about the place across the river from us - only because with all the flooding problems I didn’t know they were still serving food or even open. I decided to give them a quick call after another guest informed me they were there, and they were serving! So I gave the guest’s room a quick call to the room and let him know. 

It’s a few hours before I see this guest again, and it’s because he came down to the desk to apologise for his attitude earlier. Me being me, I dismissed it because I know all too well how being hungry can change a person. He had a couple of pints at the bar and then left, and apparently was nice about me to my GM in the morning!  

Tl;Dr : hungry man is pissed because economic problems closed our restaurant, gets told of a nearby restaurant that’s still open and is super appreciative afterwards.Tale of a Hangry Guest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tick tock, tick tock. 

I can’t remember the exact date that I started thinking about all this COVID-19 stuff, in my head I do remember thinking that this is the same sort of shit that you hear about all the time. Like many, many people I naively thought to myself that this is just one of those things you will hear about in the news for a month or two and then it’s gone like leaves in the wind. 

Tick. Tock. 

For a little context, I’ve posted under a couple different alias in the sub before, but long story short I’ve worked in the hotel industry for ten years, I don’t have a college degree and I’ve considered myself to be a “clawer” or basically I’ve clawed my way to where I am. Guess I should say was now, at this point. 

Four the last four years I was a front office manager at a “Happy House Deluxe” mid-level, limited service hotel and I really enjoyed it, despite all the challenges I had with management. I made a lot of friends and a lot of really fantastic colleagues at that hotel, but I did eventually become tired, as we all do, of management’s bullshit. So I decided that in the winter of 2019 it was time for a change, I put my resume out there and made it known that I was looking for new prospects; spreading my wings and all. 

After two or three months of searching to no avail the initial sparkle in my eye started to fade away and set in to something akin to depression. I was stuck here, I wasn’t getting out — Thankfully, I still had some of my key staff there with me and at that two to three year mark it wasn’t even so much as work anymore as it was a family or friendship. It sounds lame, I know, but we all really got along and enjoyed spending time with each other and the GM and sales could get fucked. 

And then, a random email entered my personal inbox. A hotel ownership company wanted to interview me, it was a strange email and I almost skimmed over it completely because it stunk of one of those scammy job offers with lax details. I responded back and within two weeks I was offered a job at least slightly higher pay, at a corporate office as what was essentially a regional operations officer in training, more brands, more knowledge — Fuck, this is exactly what I was waiting for, this was the success that I was looking for and my first thought was I was going to help get promotions for all the people that I knew were holding out for my job, instead of just letting one person take it at a hotel I know they wouldn’t be happy at. 

So, January and February passed so quickly, training was fast, intense and I got to know all my knew coworkers who I also quickly became close with. It is so different to work in an environment like an office but still be in hospitality, a small company and closer knit, I immediately felt like part of the team. Having a desk when I never had one before, was a strange thing. There was this stupidly, overly large clock above my desk on the taupe-colored wall, cast iron and infinitely bigger than a clock needed to be. You don’t need to see the time from one-hundred feet away, but it was a quirk I eventually came to like. I got to know our spread out portfolio of properties and I was feeling so excited about the opportunity, without the formal education I thought something like this wouldn’t ever be possible.

Tick. Tock. Tick Tock. So you know there’s a turn coming in this, it’s the same turn you’ve seen again and again. The same goddamn turn that everyone is having to deal with. 

The hammer fell fast, overnight it seemed like. One week filled with sleepless nights and unknowing. Gray, dull, wet and cold weather added to this abysmal environment, added to the way the whole world around me was feeling. 

At first it was a phone call, with everyone. Get ready to tie things down, this could get crazy. Get on the cleaning protocols. Make sure staff are trained to deal with cleaning. Make sure we help anyone who need requests. Avoid physical contact. Then it was the people above me’s turn to make decisions, I didn’t have the clout to make calls yet, but the grim air of the whole thing stunk of the old “here it comes”. Lay off all your staff, barebones, this is it - the storm. 

Within the span of two days, the formerly playful environment was now a crypt. Marble and silent and dark. And worst of all the festering stink, if you’ve ever been in this environment you no doubt know it. This is not the end. 

Then everyone started dropping like flies, the hotels were closing down completely. 90% of the staff in the office was gone and for some reason I remained, I don’t know why — I do not find myself an exceptional person, just someone who tries to get things done. I am not particularly close with any of the higher management or the owners, I just do my shit. I can’t for the life of me decide why they kept a barely trained person like myself, with decent knowledge here or there. 

But I got the sense at this point, that there was something else at play, that creeping, picking feeling at the back of your head. A long, clawed and grim finger of doubt. 

Anxiety sets in, my eyes never stop moving around. Work seems difficult, all the training I was doing seemed more morose as it went on. White computer screens turned dim and gray and nonessential. I spent more time tapping random keys and developing new, fun nervous ticks I didn’t know I had inside my head before. 

Then, it’s me and one other person. We talk, we think, we know. We’re on the block next. But, true colors show in situations such as this and true colors can be profoundly nasty. In a situation where so many people are losing their jobs, I have to ask myself how long will I hold on to mine? What will I do to hold on to mine? 

If the answer is terminate an entire hotel of people you worked with and you grew to like because the people above you are “too busy” to do it, I guess that’s the answer to my last question. This was never part of my position until that moment, I never wanted that responsibility. And so, I closed the hotel, I terminated friends, some of which I had known for four years. Lights out, dark hallways, eternally dripping water of some poorly repaired room on the sixth floor. Emergency lights became normal lights when they cut the power. 

And yes, it isn’t my fault, I guess. I tell myself that so I can sleep at least one or two hours every night. And then they close the office. What next? I’m told I still have a job, but it doesn’t feel like it, almost everyone else is gone, more doors shutter. My job was helping people, but now there’s no people to help. 

I can’t say with all the hardship out there that I’m not glad I do have a job, but in the back of my head. That claw. I wish I’d been wiped out in the first wave, because all that happened after has been endless and haunting, and I just feel like I’m trying to stay afloat. And I’m petering back and forth between some semblance of good guy and bad guy and it’s something I’ve never really had to do or was prepared to do and it was all thrust upon me in an situation where I either complied or didn’t and if I didn’t? 

It feels like only a matter of time before that hammer hits me too, I’m just waiting for it. It feels like ten years of work into the shitter. Five years of friends and work family into the shitter. They say they don’t hate me, but I feel like they do and the guilt I feel for helping these people get jobs and then having to cut them off from their source of living during this crisis. 

I just needed an opportunity to write this down, to record this, because when and it’s just a matter of when, not if, at this point. When I get terminated and I get the same speech that “This isn’t permanent, this is only temporary” that I had to give everyone and I heard the higher management give everyone, I’ll just fucking laugh because I don’t think I’d ever want to come back, not now. I feel like I was taken advantage of. It’s too different now. 

Stay safe and healthy out there, especially those of you in the hotel industry. Some of us are very likely being abandoned by some of our leadership, franchises and owners. And the best we can do is survive.It Feels Like A Ticking Clock",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
" 

So i was working Night Audit at a Hotel in the midwest. 10pm-9am. Kind of a ""meh"" hotel that attracted a lot of nefarious characters but was located right along the highway so you would get truckers, oil field guys, families etc.. normal people. But then sprinkle in your drug addicts and less desirables at the same time.

So. About 2am i get a phone call at the front desk from a gentleman who sounds a little intoxicated with a heavy accent (Redneck). He's drunk but still pretty coherent. He explains to me that his wife is being ridiculous and wants me to COME DOWN TO THE ROOM and tell her to ""Act Right"" or she can't stay there no more. A little taken aback i explain to him that ""sir, i can't tell another adult to act right, that's a grown woman. Now if you want me to call the police and have her removed from your room since it's in your name then we can definitely go that route."" ""No, no, I don't want that. I just need you to come down here and scare her a little bit so she'll act right.""  
""Sir i can't do that""  
""Aw C'mon man she's german, like she's from Germany, she don't know how stuff is here in America so she'll scare easy. Just put a little fire in her and she'll get scared and behave""  
""Ok yeah there's no way i'm doing that sir""  
""Well this is bullcrap, this is YOUR job!""  
""It's YOUR WIFE!""

So the guy gets mad and hangs up. This goes back and forth a couple times with him calling the front desk. Eventually, i hear the doorbell ding and the guy steps into the lobby. Sure enough, redneck with a beer in hand is at the front desk asking me to ""Come make her act right."" FML  
I agree to have a word with her just so i can shut him up. We get down to the room and he opens the door to what i can only explain as the most pissed off German lady i have ever seen. Tall Blonde, Athletic, at least 6ft and mad as hell. She TOWERED over this guy. Sidenote: When people are really pissed or emotional, be it anger, sex, grief, or whatever, they often resort to their native language without realizing it. She's screaming in German and he's smiling thinking im there to say ""I don't understand you please STFU and act right"" and then be on my way.

PLOT TWIST! I speak German   
She's trying her best to speak English but when i ask her what's wrong in German her eyes light up and the Guys face just DROPS. He definitely is re-evaluating the situation. She explains to me that he's drunk and being a dick and is just kinda being controlling. It's her, him and their daughter. I ask her why doesn't she just leave? She says it's normal but as long as he's drunk their inevitably going to keep arguing. At this point he's trying to chime in every third word so we switch to German. Only to be interrupted by a very sloppy scream of ""ENGLISH! SPEAK ENGLISH!""  
This goes on for a couple minutes eventually bubbling over her and him just getting into a screaming match. I am desperately losing control of the situation. Finally i just yell ""STOP! This is FUCKING RIDICULOUS, YOU ARE GROWN ADULTS, NOW FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST ACT LIKE IT"". Her argument is that he's drunk and his argument is that she's German, i guess that's code for B#tch"".

So i finally just say well why don't you just get your own room for the night if he's such a dick. NOWWWWW the waterworks come out. ""oh he stole my purse and i have no money""  
""Eff you lady you can check the dad-gun truck""  
""I know you have my Scheisse (German for shit). He throws her the keys to the truck, go check.  
ok, ok, hold the phone. Wtf is actually happening here. This is bananas. So she says, ""the only card i have is the one to our joint bank account, can i use that?  
""Does it have your name on it?""  
""YES!""  
""Then yes, that will be just fine""  
""Fuck that!, dat ders my money, she's stealing all my money!""  
""Sir, if it has both of your names on it then there's literally nothing i can do, i have to accept it""  
By this point she's beaming, she thinks she won. This entire time i think the guy is a drunk asshole but really she's just psychotic. Yeah he's drunk but he's pretty coherent and honestly i believe him. So i ask the kid whats up, kid explains they fight all the time and she's a psycho and he drinks to escape it. If i believe anybody i believe the kid. So finally he gives up and says whatever. She rushes out of the room to the lobby to pay for a seperate room.

As i'm making her reservation (All by hand by the way, super lo-tech hotel) she's telling me all the things wrong with her husband and how it was a mistake to come to America Blah blah blah. I go to run her card and it IMMEDIATELY declines. She's like wtf, i have plenty of money. Yeah ok sure you do. No, Look. She shows their account balance on her phone and they have well over $100k in checking alone. Oh, shit. Well then there should be no reason for your card to decline. Mind you the process of getting her to the lobby and making the res and all this other crap has taken at least 45 mins.

Que Redneck. Guy walks in holding his phone while WHISTLING A F$CKING TUNE. ""Lemme guess, card diddin werk diddit? Plenty of money tho huh?? Almost like.....SOMEONE SHUT YOUR CARD OFF HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!""  
THIS MOTHERF#$%%$\^ WENT ON HIS BANK APP AND REMOTELY SHUT HER CARD OFF!  
She freakin LOSES IT. Goes bat-crap crazy on the guy and starts to WRECK my lobby. At this point i've had absolutely enough. So i scream ""ENOUGH! YOU ARE GOING TO STOP DRINKING, and YOU (the wife) ARE GOING TO ACT Right! CUT.THE.SHIT. ARE WE CLEAR""?

Both heads low and both in agreement they say yes. She heads back to the room, he hangs back for a sec. Looks me in my eye and says ""Thanks man, that's all you had to do in the first place"". oh my god, this mfer just jedi mind tricked me. They both go back to the room and i didn't hear another peep out of them.

Moral of the story? if a redneck ever asks you to come down and ask his german wife to ""Act Right"", just freaking do it.The Redneck and the German",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Many years ago in the 90’s I was the Chief Night Auditor at a busy 5 Star DT hotel. We had a, somewhat rudimentary by today’s standard, hotel information system, cleverly called H.I.S. And our outlets POS was Remanco. Part of my nightly duties was to run a batch of reports from the Remanco brain in the computer room. The mother ship was called the Cremanco and had a very convoluted interface that took me some months to master.

Once I finally figured out how to run the Cremanco, I became kind of the resident guru as no one else ever went further than just running the basic reports. One particularly slow night I was messing around in the reports menu and I found of the 30+ available reports, we were only printing one. We would take 2 or 3 numbers from the report for each of the Hotel bars and restaurants plus Room Service and enter them into the master night audit report in H.I.S.

I started printing some of the other reports, one each shift, just for fun. One night fooling around with this almost bit me in the ass because the report took so long to compile I wasn’t sure it was going to finish in time for the Cafe to open at 0530 and the POS couldn’t be used until it was done. It did, but only by 10 minutes! Crisis narrowly averted!

The next night I ran a report called the Check Reprint Report. Most of the reports I had previously run, for fun, were just full of meaningless data and would go right into the garbage, but this report was only one page long. I took it back to my desk in the front office and started to read it, not fully understanding what it was at the time. The front desk motion sensor advised me of an approaching guest, I put the report in my inbox then I got busy with morning Duties, then my shift was over and I was off for 2 days.

I’d thought about the report during my days off, there was something I couldn’t put my finger on, but it bothered me. When I went back to work after days off I went a little early so I could look at the report before my shift. The report showed 7 Key IDs, no names and under each was 1 or 2 check numbers and the times they were printed. One of the keys had about 20 reprints of one check number, the others a couple each.

That night I printed the Check Reprint Report for the past month. NA was busy that night so no investigation then, but my curiosity piqued I stayed after my shift and examined each report. The pattern was the same, there were a total of about 12 unique Remanco key numbers that had a few reprints each day, but one number always had many. I went up to the Cafe to speak to the restaurant manager and asked him why a check would be reprinted so many times? He did not know why.

Then we tried to determine who used what key ID. I suggested he conduct an audit of all the keys in the possession of the servers. It took a week but we eventually were able to put a name to each Remanco ID. The key with the most reprints was a long time employee, she had been a server at the Cafe for over 20 years and was highly respected. We started conducting interviews with each of the servers starting with her. When asked why she reprinted the same check so many times she had no answer, as did none of the other employees we spoke to.

Even more miraculously the reprinting behaviour also stopped that day. We made the Reprint Order part of the daily reports and there was, literally no checks reprinted for about 6 weeks. Then one day there was 1, the next day 3, the day after that 10. Within no time the activity was back up to the previous levels. 

I was Duty Manager one weekend and was having breakfast in the Cafe Saturday morning, reading the paper and watching the servers when it hit me. I knew what was going on. I wasn’t on NA when I was the DM but I went to my office and pulled all the Reprint Reports for the month before the activity dropped off. The times of the reprints were mostly during the 3 meal rushes of the day, but most checks were reprinted between 1130 &amp; 1400. 

The Cafe had changed to a Buffet style about 2 years ago. You could still order from the menu, but we would lay out a extravagant Buffet that also featured hot items. At $7.95 for breakfast, $13.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner it wasn’t cheap, but it offered tremendous variety. It was very popular, especially for the lunch crowd as it was quick and easy. The hotel was connected by pedways to 3 high rise office buildings so the lunch rush was substantial. The hotel had taken this approach as the Cafe often struggled to be profitable despite always being busy.

I knew from the staff scuttlebutt the servers didn’t like it though as it cut into their tips. Customers were less like to tip, when they did all the work getting their meal.

I had figured out the scam, a server would put a check down for a table where everyone had, say, the lunch buffet. If they paid by credit card, that check would be closed when the card was settled against it. If the customers paid cash, which quite a few did back in those days before Interac and ApplePay, then they would take the check as their receipt, but the server would reprint the check for the next customer and as they did not have to settle the check number, the cash would go in their pocket, tax and all. The server would need to settle the check at the end of the shift, but they could easily have 30 or 40 tables during a shift and only settle 25 checks.

We re-interviewed all of the servers with our theory, starting with more junior employees first this time and it only took 2 interviews for the server to crack. She said she had been ‘taught’ this during her training, and that everybody did it. We eventually interviewed every server and everyone except the most senior one confessed. They also all pointed her as the ring leader of sorts, or at least the pioneer of the technique. A couple of servers said they were glad they were caught, they suffered tremendous guilt but couldn’t stop themselves. Servers would typically work a shift that covered 2 meal periods and if that was Lunch and Dinner they could often supplement their wage and tips with $100 or $200 in cash reprints. Serious coin in those days!

A few servers quit, a few were fired, a couple were reprimanded and agreed to repay a portion by allowing the hotel to garnish their wages for a year for an agreed upon amount. That was handled by HR so I was not privy to the amount. The senior server steadfastly stuck to her guns saying she was innocent. I was able to figure out how to print a reprint report for only her key, and I did so for as far back as the records went, about 18 months. As far as we could calculate she was pocketing an extra $250 - $400 A DAY, more on special occasions or during Christmas when the buffet prices temporarily increased. 

She was terminated, and, unbelievably tried to file a wrongful dismissal suit. When we, and our Corporate Attorney met with her lawyer and presented an inch thick pile of the reprint reports, plus a spreadsheet I created showing her theft was in excess of $100 000 over 18 months the attorney got up and left saying we’d hear from them soon. We never heard from her again. I left the hotel myself a few months later and never heard if they followed up with charges. We also figured out how to make the reprint function require supervisor override.

All of that because of a bored Night Auditor!Catching a Thief",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm working night audit this evening and, to be honest, I was thinking about making a post earlier about how oddly active things have been at the hotel this evening. The past few weeks things have been pretty dead with minimal guest interactions. But all night long, I've heard people going up and down the hallway on the first floor, in and out of the elevator, but never actually coming up to the lobby. Usually by the time I'd peak around the corner, they'd be gone so I just shrugged it off and it didn't seem particularly story worthy, so I didn't bother with posting. 

But just now, I was startled by a mother and daughter rounding the corner to introduce themselves. With the local college shutting down, the mother had traveled cross country to help her daughter move out of her dorm. They got the notification yesterday that the campus would be on lockdown after midnight and people wouldn't be allowed to go in and out, so they had to rush to throw everything in their car and they've spent the whole night bringing it in, washing what can be washed, and boxing everything up to take it to a storage unit until the school reopens. The mother flew across the country to help her daughter get packed up/home and now most of the flights back are being canceled, so their only option to even **get** home is a flight out tomorrow, so they're rushing to get everything ready in time and that's why they've been buzzing around like bees. 

It was nice of her to let me know what was going on because I was pretty curious and I feel for the pair of them dealing with such a hectic situation. I told them to let me know if there was anything I could do to help. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a whole lot. These are crazy times!Well now I know",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I've been monitoring this community for the last few weeks in the wake of this epidemic. I've seen stories of hotels closing and people getting laid off and, overall, I'd say I've had a pretty realistic outlook on how things are going down in my local area as well as at large. I've been as proactive as possible with addressing ways that we can protect our guests and ourselves here at our hotel. All the while though, I've been under the assumption that, unless we closed completely, it seemed unlikely that our front desk staff would be laid off. We run on a pretty bare bones crew after all. 

So I was pretty thrown off when I came in tonight to find out that three of our seven total staff are being laid off as the FDM and GM are starting to pick up front desk shifts, working almost 50hrs a week a piece. The whole kitchen staff has been laid off, with the exception of the three managers. I haven't had a chance to speak directly with the GM about the situation. But apparently another co-worker and myself are the only two non-management staff that are being kept on for the time being. I usually work three nights a week and it looks like they may cut me back to two.  My co-worker had his hours slashed in half, so he's getting hit worse by this than I am. 

I'm still kind of in shock about the whole thing. I mean, realistically, I understand why they did it and should have seen it coming. But a lot of the people these people have come to feel like family to me, so I can only hope beyond what is probably a reasonable hope that this is going to pass quickly and we can get back to business as usual here. 

Tonight, when I came in, I pulled out a box filled with spring decorations that this time two weeks ago I was elbow deep in assembling to give our lobby a little flare. The project was set on the back burner while we addressed the more serious issues of this pandemic and its impact on the hotel. I guess I'm going to get back to work on them now. I've cleaned and prepped about as much as I can tonight, so I might as well work on something pretty to keep my mind off of where things are going to go from here.I was naive to think the layoffs wouldn't hit home.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Ok so please tell me if I’m being dumb for getting annoyed at this question that this guest asked me?

So it’s been suuuuuper dead and our hotel has been making some changes what with all this craziness that’s happening. We got rid of our evening dinners, breakfast is no longer a Buffett but to-go bags where everything is wrapped, gym closed, pool closed and houskeeping service is only Monday-Thursday. We have let everyone know this at check in and we put a sign in their room and all over the hotel notifying everyone of what’s going on. So I get a call from a guest and this is what she asks me

ME= Me of course

Me: *phone rings* front desk this is Mrcupcake how can I help you?

DL: Hi there so I have a question, so we were thinking of staying one more night but I just want to know is there a discount or do I have to go online?

Me:.....discount? I’m sorry I don’t understand?

DL: well there’s no social, no breakfast, gym and pool are closed and they don’t clean our room so for what we’re paying for we should be paying less because we paid this much for all of these amenities that we can’t get

Me: (looks at her rate and see she’s paying $127 which is a special tier sparkly member rate which is way cheaper then our regular rate so she is already getting a discount) well I do see you are already getting a discount because you are a sparkly member which thank you for that but to my knowledge we are not giving discounts for the changes that are being made at the hotel, were you not made aware of what was going on?

DL: no we were I was just wondering if there was a discount since we’re basically not getting what we paid for

Me: well I definitely understand the frustration but you have to understand due to what’s going on w—

DL: I know that....

Me:ok......well this is something out of our control so no there are no discounts

Ok so mind you she was not rude but like....really? I understand coming to a hotel and not getting what you paid for but she has two rooms and they have been here almost a week and they decide to complain now? And also do you not know what’s happening right now? We’re lucky to even still be open! Idk I was just real annoyed by this like ummmm excuse me?

"So just like every other hotel, our boutique 38 room hotel is absolutely suffering thanks to this Coronavirus pandemic.

To clarify my stance in this company, we have two properties, and I moved from to the other to become a supervisor. Upon moving properties I was cross trained for night audit and ended up realising I absolutely love night audit. Auditors get a free meal, higher pay than supervisor, and it’s a relaxing night of just punching numbers and counting money. Unfortunately, the full time auditor wasn’t going anywhere, so the dream job wasn’t achievable (mind you his rate was one of the highest of any hourly employee).

Fast forward, this pandemic is going on and has caused both properties to be down to a skeleton crew and restaurants are closed; ours can only do take-out. Basically, only hotel salary managers have not been laid off, along with supervisors. Yesterday I received news that we cut the skeleton crew even further... the night auditor is cut and the other supervisor. I’m now going to be full time night audit with a set schedule and two consecutive days off, all managers are now hourly meaning they make the same as me, and I get free food every night and freedom during the day. Out of the 350 or so employees in the corporation (several restaurants outside the hotels), only about 20 have a job right now, and I’m feeling *pretty damn lucky* right about now. The owner even offered me a room if I ever need one.How everything worked in my favour in this virus crisis",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Judging by the people checking in to my hotel this week, one would think everything is fine.

For context, I work at a beachside resort in a very popular tourist area in Florida.

As most of you know, we're getting into Spring Break time.

Part of our effort for Coronavirus prevention, is that housekeeping is not cleaning stayover rooms.

A woman called the other day and the conversation was as follows:

Me: \*answers phone\*

Guest: ""Um...yeah...our room hasn't been cleaned today.""

Me: ""I'm so sorry ma'am, but housekeeping is foregoing cleaning rooms that are not checking out. Is there anything you need that they can deliver?""

G: ""We need new sheets.""

Me: ""OK, I'll have them deliver new sheets, but I do not know if they will be comfortable going into the room and changing them.""

G: ""WHAT?! WHY NOT?!""

Me: ""For the safety of our staff.""

G: ""THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!""

Me: (in my head, YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE YOU DUMB TWIT!!) Ok ma'am. I'll send them right over with those sheets.""

Shortly after that, I checked in a woman that said, ""You'd think the beach would be a great place to quarantine!"" (I know it's ok to be outside, but people are definitely not practicing social distancing.

I then looked at her like the idiot that she is and said, ""Well ma'am, we're supposed to be avoiding large crowds, and the beach is a place where people tend to gather.""

She then said, ""We were supposed to go to the zoo, but that got shut down.""

MAYBE TAKE A GODDAMN HINT AND STAY HOME!!

Then yesterday, our public beaches got shut down. We're on a private beach, and we got about 400 phone calls asking if ours would close. Given that we are a local, non-corporate hotel, and our owners will NEVER turn down the opportunity to make money, we probably won't close.

Someone called and asked about the beach and after hemming and hawing for a few minutes (so many people did this...like, sure, I have time for this...) she asks what I would do (they have a reservation for all of next week). I told her I wouldn't risk my health or the health of my family, it's just not worth it. Not sure yet if she canceled.

For now, all hourly associate's hours are drastically cut, some don't even have any hours. Of course, if we are not comfortable coming to work, then they don't want us to. But god damnit, the public's overall ineptitude and selfishness is just so grossly unsettling.

"Haven't posted anything in a long time, but today was a first....

A few different things happened throughout the course of my short day today, so I will just put them in one story. TLDR at the end. Also posting on mobile. 

Tale #1) First, short back story. Due to low occupancy, we are keeping our guests off of the top floor. There are 3 rooms occupied on the top floor. Guest checks in last night and said they need a quiet room because they will be working overnight. No problem, what's more quiet than the top floor? They made a comment about how at the last hotel they couldn't sleep because hskp was vacuuming in the hallway. Okay, that's kind of an every hotel thing, but whatever.

Cue today, guess who calls me at noon upset because hskp was vacuuming right outside of their door? I apologized, but 20 minutes later the guest comes down to check out because now they can't sleep. I get working overnight, I really do. I did night audit for years, but I can't stop hskp from vacuuming the hallway. So anyway, guest checks out, and then one of my co workers tells me that this guest wished coronavirus on everyone at the hotel. I didn't even know what to say, what a terrible thing to say to someone.



Tale #2) About 5 minutes after that, I go check another room to see if that guest had checked out. They were just leaving the room and went out the side entrance to wait on their ride. Alright, they are out of the room, that's all that matters. Side note: during all of this hskp was also wrapping up for the day. So, a few minutes later I get a phone call from one of the housekeepers saying someone must have left their luggage, but there's no one with it. Alright, I walk down to the side entrance and I see the same guest with their luggage, but nothing seems out of the ordinary. They said they are still waiting on their ride. I walk back to the desk and another housekeeper that had just left called to me ""there's a lady outside and she's peeing by the cooler"" WAIT. WHAT?! SHE'S PEEING? ""Yeah, she's peeing by the air conditioning unit"". So I go back out there again and she said her ride isn't coming and she starts walking toward the gas station. Thankfully she didn't come back.



Tale #3) Very short one, a couple checks in and then come to check out about 30 minutes later because they received a phone call that they had been exposed to coronavirus 😕 I obviously wished them the best and stay safe, and of course didn't charge them since they were barely in the room. I definitely did go in and disinfected everything right away.



So, that was my day. How was yours? 🙃

TLDR: Guest wishes coronavirus on all the hotel and another guest decides its a good idea to relieve herself outside.""She is what? She's peeing outside?!"" and other small tales",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Oi. I just had a guest come into my lobby to get some extra linens. It's a middle aged couple that have been known to complain their way to a free night.

So I go to the back to get them their linens, and when I come back they asked me about the man being able to use the gym. We have closed our gym due to concerns over coronavirus. I informed them that it was a policy put in place by our GM, and that if they would like to speak to someone about it they can come back in the morning.

Then the guy hit me with ""Well, I'm an ER nurse, I know how to clean. I can't use the gym if I wipe it down before and after?""

Me: ""No sir, I cannot let you use our gym.""

Then the wife came back with, ""First breakfast, now the gym. I mean, this is why we pay so much to stay here.""

Me: ""..."" (resisting the urge to roast these people)

Her: ""Well I guess we'll just come back tomorrow and talk to the GM, and *call corporate*."" *sideways smirk*

Me: ""I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I hope you have a good night.""

*huge simultaneous eye roll between me and security as they walk out the door*

Man, you would think being an ER nurse, he would understand the importance of stopping the spread of a highly infectious disease...

Update: The couple called our GM about using the gym. Gave him all the same stories and excuses for why he should be the only one to use it. After a bit of a lengthy call and him declining their request multiple times, they threatened to call corporate again. He said, ""Please do,"" and hung up on them xD.

He had a really rough day after having to fire all but 7 employees (which is a whole other post). So he had *no* patience for them.""I'm an ER nurse, I know how to clean...""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So my managers and I had a sit down today, in an effort to keep our hotel from having to shut down, effectively leaving everyone at my property out of a job for the foreseeable future, they fired 10 housekeepers and have cut back hours so severely that they told me to apply for supplemental unemployment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thankful that I still live at home and my parents support me for basic needs and I go to work to pay off the small amount of bills I have plus my college tuition, but my other coworkers aren't as lucky. I have one coworker who is struggling to pay for his home for his family after his dad fucked off and left them all in debt. I am so terrified, I know that right now I have a decent amount of money saved up but the money I have saved is for my next semester of college and I'm worried that if we do end up closing down like some of the hotels in the area already have that I will have to dig into those savings to pay off my car and some of my other bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only that but 10 of our wonderful housekeeping ladies are out of jobs, but I feel horrible because I'm one of the people they spared instead of one of them. I know it's hard for everyone but I don't have a family and kids to support. I have my own worries for sure, but I can't help but feel so bad about still having a job while they don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

AND TO TOP OFF THE SHIT CAKE THAT CORONA HAS CAUSED we have a dude staying with us who works at a hospital and 2 of his patients tested positive for corona. He came in with the same scrubs he worked with on and without gloves and touched everything up at the front desk I am typing at right now. My coworker sanitized it as best as he could but we are all still worried. The dude is self quarantining in a hotel because he has little ones at home and while I get it and understand why he doesn't want to be home, he came in and just disregarded the safety of around 40 guests and the front desk staff working at the time and I'm just pissed. I just wish all of this would pass and it could be before this was a thing again.Fears from a hotel close to Corona.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I've been laid off, the hotel I worked at up until today is closing. I expected the government to have been the ones to tell us to close shop but was surprised when it came from the uppers. Oh well, gives me time to reflect on past guests and incidents and share :)

Some background, years back I worked a different hotel, night audit. I was training a new employee and it was her first night. The location had 80 odd rooms and parking was free.

It was a busy night, I don't remember what exactly the event was but there were no parking spots on the property left. I parked next door at the business lot. They only asked any overnighters move their car in the morning before it opens. No big deal. We still had arrivals coming in and I told them the situation with parking. 

Now onto our lovely guest.

As before, I was training this new girl and I hear the front doors slam open. Looking up I spotted this middle aged guy storming up to the desk. I quietly told the new girl to let me handle it and keep checking in the guest at the desk. Again, night audit shift, so it's nearly midnight when this happens.

""Good eve-""

""WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PARK!?!? THERE ARE NO SPOTS!!""

""I understand that sir and I apologize, there is the business lot next door that has been accommodating to us to-""

""THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE! I PAID FOR A ROOM HERE, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARK HERE!""

""Again, I'm sorry sir, but I cannot make a space for you in our lot, it's full. I had to go park next door as well-""

""ARE YOU STAYING HERE?!""

I will admit, I lost my cool here, but this guy from the start had been full on screaming at me every time he opened his mouth.

""Okay, that is enough! (Insert surprised Pikachu face on the guest) This is the deal tonight, we don't have parking! So if you want to stay here then you will park next door and you will move your vehicle before 10am before they open, they will ticket and tow if it's not gone! If you want to cancel then say so but you will not be screaming in here anymore!""

My coworker's jaw had dropped and her check in process had stalled so I walked over to quietly finish checking in the shocked guest. Screamo stood shocked for maybe 10 seconds before going back outside during this.

The guest I was helping started laughing once Screamo was outside, ""I think you handled that very well!"" Chuckling he walked away. 

My coworker had still not picked her jaw off the floor so I turned to her and said, ""You don't have to put up with abusive guests, I will back you and so will our manager.""

She then looks over my shoulder and wordlessly points out the window. Screamo was walking from the direction of the business lot heading for our doors again. I giggled a bit, told her to check him in, and went about my night.


I never got any blow back from that night. I did tell my manager in the morning and she laughed, told me to do better and went to go get breakfast started. A week later I was browsing our reviews when I read a familiar tale.

""Night worker at desk was rude as can be. There was no parking so I went to talk about lack of parking and was screamed at and blown off and ignored when I came back to check in after parking down the street. So instead of having 2 people with huge trailers park in a different lot, you have 10 people park elsewhere. Makes perfect sense.""

I laughed, took a screenshot and sent it to my manager. I love reading how rude guests try to play the victim and post a bad review to get something.We ran out of parking spots",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My title is a Trailer Park Boys reference btw. \^-\^ 

Our property is laying off a good bit of employees as of next week we will have 10 people here working and that includes breakfast staff being cut this weekend will be the last for awhile. Well that being said I have been kinda helping with preparing the foods we have been putting out for guests. Which we have been cooking the last bit of our biscuits and meats and making makeshift combo sandwiches. Everything labeled and fruits wrapped in plastic, everything out and grab and go type of breakfast. Which everyone at check in is told what to expect. 

Yesterday morning as we are preparing labels and getting everything set out my coworker basically let me know she would be asking guests to take one of each item as we are limited on supply. Not a big deal I get it so as we finish up I am at the desk and my coworker walks up and sees a guest walk up and fill a bag with all the biscuits after she conveyed earlier to him the limited supply. As she walked out he ran out the back door to his car. Both of us just watching this grown man running from my 4'9 breakfast host. Laughing I go to see what the damage was. 

12 Bacon biscuits which there were only 15 made, we shook our head and went about our day. This man came up tonight when I got here and asked if we were still having breakfast like we did the last 2 days. 

""Yes sir, but we are limited in supplies so we are asking everyone to be mindful of other guests,"" As I tell him this he gets super angry. 

""If I want to eat I will eat no one will tell me otherwise! I paid to stay here and I will eat whatever the F I want-"" Goes on for a good few minutes before his roommate or coworker whatever who has been standing behind him chimes in. 

""She's only asking that you don't steal a bunch of biscuits then vomit them up at work dude. You wasted so much food yesterday being greedy. Don't worry miss we wont take more than we need,"" they both walked off after that. 

I will be avoiding that this morning. geeze. 

Anyways... I hope everyone out there is doing well and taking precautions to stay healthy. 

Is everyone having issues with guests and breakfast? We have had a bit of an issue with people being upset about the food being grab and go. :PNo one likes to admit they ate 9 cans of Ravioli. (or in this case 12 biscuits)",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Im no longer working as a clerk but my favorite entitled story is about a Russian guy and his wife.

I was working in a small inn that was well located in the old city. There is rooms all around the reception desk on a busy summer day. I work on the evening shift until the next morning.

I was paid to stay at work until the guy of the morning shift arrived to take over. This Russian guy wakes me me at 3 AM, saying he wanna check out and go to the airport. Sure, whatever.

But then, he start lying, a big fat lie, in a very bad English, about my boss giving him a 50% discount on the price of his room. Mind you, this is not only impossible but the more and more he talk, the less his story make sense.

Me: Im sorry sir but I have to charge you at the normal price...

He then begin to SCREAM! That would wake up all the other rooms, I cant have that! Realizing what was trying to do, despise my tired mind, I came up with a solution. **I lied to him**, saying:

Me: Im sorry sir, I simply don't have the code in my machine to change the bill. Only my supervisor, the one you did the reservation from, can change the bill at this point. Here's what we are going to do: Im going to charge you normally and when my boss will come back tomorrow morning, he will deal with this and adjust the bill accordingly. I'll write him a little note about it.

He was suspicious about it but accepted. He wanted me to write him the note, which I did but I put an **VERY** obvious false name: the name of of a previous political figure.

When I told my supervisor about it the next day, he laughed VERY hard about it and gave me a pat on the back, telling me that I dealt with that like a champ.

"Obligatory im on mobile, been in the industry for 6.5 years, I've seen some shit. Me=me; nice guest=NG; Totally oblivious dude= TOD (isn't actually his name i promise) unintentionally long. 


So we have a cold breakfast that is seemingly best aimed at our construction workers. Since most of our people are not suit and tie men, we have learned to cater towards the boots and reflective vests.

We have a couple or four guys here currently,  some of them are so sweet. And one of them eats breakfast daily. Well with this covid stuff going on, we cant have anything out that we bag ourself which is quite a bit of our offerings. Along with the tables being flipped and out of the way.

So this morning he goes back, and comes out to tell me he thinks we forgot some stuff. So I go explain it to him - no big deal he's super understanding, grabs a muffin, and goes to leave. 

Well in comes TOD. I go to leave the room because I know TOD was told last night about there not being much for breakfast. He stops me and asks me what I'm doing because he cant get filled up on muffins and cereal. I kind of sigh and have to explain what I was told all this week 

Me ""I am sorry, but this is currently all we can legally offer due to restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak""

TOD ""well you had breakfast last week why don't you today?""

Me ""these restrictions were mainly placed over this weekend and early this week. We do offer hard boiled eggs and yogurt and peanut butter if you are looking for a more protein filled morning"" 

TOD ""actually you know what. Last night I was told there would still be a full breakfast including bacon and I either want my money back or you're making me bacon""

Me ""sir we don't have bacon and if we did, we don't have a stove to cook it in. We do not serve hot food at this hotel"" 

At this point TOD starts to ramble on about his super awesome stays at other hotels when Nice Guy comes back around the corner. 

NG "" look dude she said no breakfast today let's just move past that and go.""

TOD ""YOU STAY OUT OF THIS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME""

NG ""well what i do know is I've been staying here four nights a week for 7 months and I've never seen you before in my life so I think I know what their breakfast is. They've never had hot food and they don't have to deal with your shit."" 

Me to TOD ""sir let's just calm down and head out for the day, if you don't want the options I can provide, there are plently of gas stations still cooking breakfast and you could stop there on your way to work""

TOD "" No. I will eat breakfast from here and you ARE NOT CHARGING ME FOR IT""

Me ""okay deal. Free breakfast for you if what we have is going to satisfy you."" 

Kicker is we have never charged for our breakfast. We all just kind of dispersed. Me back to my desk, nice guy on his way to work, and TOD was filling himself up on his free eggs and yogurt. He takes peanut butter and jelly in his pocket for presumably later???

About 20 minutes later he comes to the desk to check out and has to double check that he didn't get charged for breakfast. 

Nice guy has stuck up for me in the past but never like this. And man did I need that today. I hope that this covid stuff calms down soon.No breakfast! None at all!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Had a reasonable length conversation with Guest and His dad about why they were here. They’re visiting local businesses and such to make working relationships.

"I had an older ""gentleman"",  an Elite member of our brands rewards program staying for three nights. (FYI-occupancy has been going down drastically- currently at 15%)

I'm Night Audit, so my interaction with this guest has been minimal the first two nights: he has come down for coffee and breakfast and to use the business center. He has printed enough of whatever hes working on for me to refill paper at least a half dozen times and ink cartridge once. (previous one was brand new!) Not a big deal really, a guest is a guest, especially right now.

But today at checkout he tells me to fix his rate for him, as he was quoted online/through app at 118 per night for the first two nights, then he extended over phone to front desk for third night. He walked away before i could look into it but when he returned i had looked into account and saw that his rate for the three nights were as follows 105/122/118... So there shouldn't have been an issue.

I asked guest as politely as possible if i was mistaken at his request and explained his rate to him. He gives the deer in headlights look, then says that he was quoted 105 rate... Um no man I'm not a genius but i can retain things said to me at least from less then five minutes ago. 

I cant lie, my face probably gave away the ringing that was my BS meter, but my tone and words still conveyed that generic politeness that comes from getting on your knees to service the customer. I told him i would pass along his request to management.

He didn't like that. 

Guest- Boy (yea he called me boy, He is Caucasian, I am Mixed) Do you know how many points i have?

Me- No sir i Do not

Guest-Boy (again!) I have 3 million points, I am an elite member, I would have stayed here 50 nights a year,  But if you (looks at my name tag and calls me by name, sarcastically) Wont treat me right i guess its your job and livelihood i feel sorry for. Plenty of other hotels in the brand that will take care of me. 

Me- (lying) I apologize sir, I don't have the authority to adjust rates and reverse the room charges necessary to refund you. I will pass on to management and I am sure they will take care of you. 

Guest- I see why they have someone like you working graveyard. Is this how you treat Elite members? Do you see what level I am ??

Me- Sir I actually make a habit of treating every guest, and person for that matter with the same amount of respect. I don't go by status.

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by what happened. I mean, the entire world has gone crazy and we've been going crazy a little bit longer here in WA. Yesterday I showed up to my now 4 hour long shift, past even the latest check out time for shiny folks. They were still in house but my manager saw them take the luggage cart up so hopefully they would be leaving soon. Nearly an hour past check out, they finally did at almost 5pm. A couple hours later, they pull back in to the lot and she comes in to tell me she left their clothes in one of the dryers. Ok no problem, made a key for it, she took their stuff and left. A short time later my house person came and told me that for the third time that evening someone had stolen all the toilet paper from the women's room.

"At the last hotel I used to work at, we had a guest who would constantly intimidate our front desk workers into giving him generous discounts for no reason whatsoever. This hotel wasn't part of a chain, and it wasn't managed particularly well. Like in it's 30 years of existence, there was more than 30 different managers. Anyway, this particular guest would come in shitfaced at like 4pm, then he would berate my coworkers into giving him a room at a cheaper price for no reason. Well, I wasn't going to put up with his shit because I was tired of seeing him around the hotel. This time he came in on St. Patrick's Day, and obviously having just came here from the closest Irish bar, he's absolutely hammered. 

He comes in and asks for a generous discount, as far as I can remember it was like 25% off for no reason. Then when I tell him ""no, you have to pay full price for your room"", he starts to tell me that we have a ""St. Patrick's Day"" discount and I laugh back in his face. I continue to refuse his requests, and then I got first hand his intimidation tactic. This wasn't a particularly strong or physically imposing person at all, but he would RAISE HIS VOICE AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO GET HIS WAY. This hotel I used to work at exclusively employed college students who were tired and busy with their studies, so they would just give the guy what he wanted when he shouted for it. So he's shouting at me, and then I start shouting back ""You can't just intimidate or berate me and my coworkers to get what you want!"" and then he responds ""FINE! I'LL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE THEN!"" and then I shout back ""GOOD!"" and he storms out of the hotel.

We had an elderly guest that had issues walking and a friend of his kept asking us to do welfare checks since he wasn't answering her calls (she called him over 5x a day for weeks). We had seen him Sunday when the room was cleaned, but not since (he would only leave to go do short errands and some days he didn't leave). 

Any time anyone would knock on the door this week he said he was fine-even when the emergency key got used yesterday to open the door (just a few inches since he had the chain on it). Personally, I had gone to check on him Monday, yesterday, and today. 

Tonight after I got home, my GM messaged me to tell me that the friend had shown up and they had broken the chain (something we were going to do in the morning) and found the guy on the floor where he'd been for two days. They've taken him to the ER and I don't know his condition-but why didn't he just say he needed help to the five people that kept checking on him for days?!

Because of this lovely virus, our hotel occupancy has dropped drastically. We're at 17% tonight. The GM announced that layoffs will be happening, myself included, so this may be my last story for a while. 

But back to this guest. His room is always paid by someone else, and we would have a credit card authorization on file. He came in tonight without a reservation, so I go through my spiel and ask for a credit card.

G: It should be on file. I was just here last week. 
 
I tried to copy the card from the last stay but it wouldn't let me, so my co-worker went to check the authorization binder in the office.

So what do you do with a no-show that won't communicate? You charge them the one night and cancel right? Right. Or it's what we do anyway. 

So the cast of todays story is: 
NS - No show guest. 
and me. Duh. 

Ring ring! 
Me- Hello, hotel front desk, how may I help you?

NS- Hi!, I . . .uh, I had a reservation for tomorrow, yea for tomorrow and I need to cancel it please, we won't be able to make it because of the plague. 

Me - Sure I can take care of that for you. It looks like we actually had you booking with us through a third party on the 17th, yesterday. 

NS- Oh . . yea, I guess it was for yesterday. We still need to cancel it. 

Me - Well unfortunately sir, I cannot really ""cancel"" it as we already checked your reservation out. We did try to contact you yesterday both via the phone and with a message through your booking, but we didn't hear back so we assumed you were still coming and charged you for the one night. 

NS- well it wasn't our fault our show cancelled and it was a package and we thought it all was cancelled. We thought the theatre would cancel our room with the hotel too. 

(eyebrow raise here) 

Me- No sir, our hotel is not affiliated with the huge theatre with a completely different name. We did message you, on your booking, that if you were not showing you would need to cancel before the end of your reservation day so that we could waive the fees. 

NS- So you will refund us right? Because it wasn't our fault? and we didn't know we would need to cancel?
Me- I can pass your information to our management team sir, it would at this point be up to them whether they can refund you for the room that you booked and didn't show up for. 

uhg...... We will probably end up refunding it, and I don't mind not charging people that don't show up, when they TELL me they aren't showing up. but when you call me past your time of check out to tell me you are not coming, no I hope we keep your money.

"This happened today during 1st shift.  I work 2nd.     

Over time if you work at a property that does a hot breakfast buffet each day, you'll occasionally get a local or non-guest stroll in and try to help themselves to free breakfast.  Our 1st shift FD lady can usually pick the out the ""freetards"" and send them packing.     

Due to the pandemic; like most properties, we our suspending the hot breakfast buffet and limiting options to a prepackaged and single-serving continental.    

Lady comes in and out of her purse pulls a plastic grocery bag.  Begins filling it up with an assortment of breakfast items.  Then goes to the coffee station and fills up a full-size thermos, then goes back to put more goodies into her bag.  The whole time she's pretending to be on a phone call.  I don't think this her first rodeo.     

Our FD notices her and goes into the lobby and initiates the guest? / name? / room # ? interrogation.  She asks her make believe significant other over the phone ""What room are we in hun?""  She answers ""327"".  We have 26 rooms per floor.  When asked what name the room is registered, she knows the gig is up.        

She drops her bag of hotel hoard, grabs her thermos and heads out the front door.  FD lady picks up an apple and follows her out.  This is the part where I tell you that FD lady throws knives competitively.        Angered that her hotel breakfast heist was foiled, she turns around and pours out the thermos of coffee onto our parking ramp (bad idea), then heads for her car.  In route, she get pegged in the back with the apple!    

The downside to this:  The brain / DVR of our security camera system was replaced a couple days ago.  The installer turned the system to view only, not record.  Had it been recorded you can bet your sweet ass I would have it uploaded to YouTube 🤣 - - - - - - - - 🍎The Failed Non-Guest Breakfast Heist",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"SO.  With everything going on around us, my hotel is at &lt;20% capacity; we are very slow, and it's painful to both our activity and bank accounts.  I'm at work as I'm writing this, too; this woman calls down not more than 10 minutes ago asking what restaurants are open currently.  Crotchety Woman (or CW) we'll call her.

CW: ""So, is there anything open on the (beach) pier to eat? Like, what even is there?""

Me: ""Well, a lot of restaurants are doing take-out or to-go orders; their dine-in services are temporarily on hold because of our current circumstance.""

CW: ""...are you serious?  I came out here for a vacation and I'm paying a lot of money to stay here.  Do you know specifically what places are open for food?""

Me: (quite honestly baffled at this) ""I don't know exactly, no, but if you order through Postmates or Grubhub they'll notify you which ones are still open for service.""

CW: ""This is ridiculous, what's your name???""

Me: (in stunned silence for a good 5 seconds) ""(NAME)""

CW: ""Thanks for nothing (NAME)"" \*click\*

Did I miss something? Are we not on damn near quarantine and this woman is balling about FOOD? She wasn't even paying that much either; she's paying $259 for a regular $329+ room! Given the circumstances, the rates were obviously lowered, but ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME.I guess I ruined her vacation..?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We recently got a contract with an airline (holy saving grace during this difficult time, wow), and part of the reason is because we have shuttle service available to and from the airport. Our shuttle(s) run all day and we actually have the schedule for the month scheduled ahead of time since we receive it before the month starts. My drivers have been working stretched hours for two weeks to accommodate all these crews, they’re rockstars, I’m so thankful.

This particular airline has crews coming and going about a dozen times a day and have stayed in various hotels, so they’re pretty well known around town. Tonight, a taxi driver called the crew out by their company name, so they assumed that we arranged this ride for them in lieu of our shuttle. Evidently that was a common practice for their former hotel. Our shuttle must have passed that cab because he was picking up two crews that landed within 5 minutes of each other and he ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes with one of the crews until the one in the cab showed up to the hotel’s door. 

I express checked them in, business as usual. And then the cab driver came in and asked me for $25 for bringing the crew from the airport. I told him I did not call him to bring this crew, in fact my van driver is waiting at the airport for them now. He should have arranged payment with them, because I do not have any money to pay a cab I did not order. He said the “other hotel” with the previous contract would just pay for a cab whenever he brought a crew. I explained that I do not have the authorization to do that. Nice try, though!

Cabbie is pretty pissed, obviously, and yelling at me. He threatens to call the police, and I tell him to do what he has to do. And as you can imagine, the cops tell him that he should have arranged payment with either the crew or hotel directly before agreeing to take the fare. What he really should have done is not try to swindle a fare that wasn’t his, expecting all hotels to just pay random cabbies just because it’s 11.

This was my first situation like this, what with the new crew and me who’s only recently moved up from bartender to FOM, and I’m glad it went smoothly...but yikes, who do you think has extra money to pay *anyone* right now, guy?Nice try, taxi guy.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I don't work a hotel, but I do work a front desk. I'm the receptionist at a manufacturing company, where I answer the phones, and direct visitors to their appointments. Given all that is going on with the coronavirus, we are doing everything in our power to not get infected, as shutting down would totally stop production. We know it is a possibility we will have to shut down, so we are trying to take any precautions we can right now to prolong that from happening, in order to at least finish the projects we are working on now.  We are keeping our front doors locked, with a sign on each of the doors that reads: *Due to the recent COVID-19 virus, the company has made the decision to restrict visitation through the end of the month. If you have a scheduled appointment, please call your company contact for entrance.*

So basically, you have to have a scheduled appointment with a specific person to enter our facility right now. We have a lot of sales people come in unannounced and try to get our business. Typically, I let them come in, get the card of the appropriate employee, and pass along their information. But that's just not happening right now. So, I saw a salesman walk up to our door, only to find it was locked. Any person with a drop of intelligence would probably read the signs we have posted once they realize the doors are locked. Nope. This nuisance decides to call me.

Salesman: ""Hello, I am right outside of your facility and for some reason I cannot get in""

Me: ""Do you have a scheduled appointment with someone?""

Salesman: ""No, but I already drove 45 minutes to get here, and I'm waiting outside for someone to open the door.""

Me: ""Well sir, if you are at our facility, then you can read the signs that we have posted, as we are not allowing any unscheduled visitors at this time.""

Salesman: ""Are you being smart with me? This is just ridiculous and unprofessional! Who can I complain to about this?""

Now, my boss tells me I don't have to take shit from anyone who isn't a customer, especially sales people, so if they give me an attitude, I'm allowed to give one right back.

Me: ""Well sir, if you really want to file a complaint, you would do that through me (which is true). However, we are in the middle of a global pandemic, so I hope that you can be understanding during this time. Do you still want to file a complaint?""

Salesman: \*\*\*pauses for about 10 seconds ""No! This is just ridiculous though! You all are over reacting!""

Me: ""Well, that's your opinion. Thank you for your compliance."" *click*

tl;dr: a salesman tried to get into our facility, despite the fact that we have multiple signs clearly stating we are not taking visitors at this time

"I was talking to the boss at the start of my shift. Even though  our lobby restroom is out of order due to the toilet being wonky, somebody went in there and stole the soap and paper towels. The soap is one of those bladders/pouches you put in a dispenser. They just popped it open and took the whole pouch. They also took all the paper towels from the dispenser. They either had a key or just turned the knob until it was drained.

Thanks a lot, assholes.

I know there's a size limit, and I don't remember what it is, but I'll add that I just sanitized the whole damn lobby and everything behind the counter.

"Me again. Just started my shift about an hour ago, and I just had the most headache inducing phone call of my life. So my hotel is roughly six and half miles away from that famous man's park that was just recently closed due to this virus. My hotel partners with the park and we sell tickets for them as a perk/incentive to stay with us as we do get a lot of guests that book with us with the intention of going to the famous park. Now, keep in mind again, that the park, is closed. So this guest calls and I do my spiel, ""Thank you for calling\_\_\_\_\_\_ how can I direct your call?"" Guest responds asking for the front desk, and I inform him that that was who he was speaking with.

Guest: ""Well I'm planning on taking my family to the famous park next week and I see that your hotel sell tickets to the famous park. Is that correct?""

So. The park had told us when they closed that we were not to sell tickets. Our manager even told us that if a guest insists on buying, that we direct them to the park's website.

Me: ""Yes sir that is correct, however we are not selling tickets at this time as the park is closed.""

Guest: ""What do you mean the park is closed? How can they shut down an entire theme park? They can't do that! That's illegal.""

Me: ""Sir, the park is closed because the governor has declared a state of emergency due to the Corona virus and places that occupy 250 people or more are to be closed until further notice.""

Guest: ""Well I hardly see what that has to do with the park being closed. I think you're lying to me because you just don't want to sell me tickets. What is your name? I'm going to report you and your hotel to your corporate office and have you shut down.""

Me: ""Sir allow me to direct you to their website, they will be able to provide you with more information.""

Guest: ""I don't need anymore information, what I need is some GODDAMN TICKETS NOW SELL THEM TO ME.""

Now one thing to note, all ticket purchases through us have to be done in person on property. We cam't do them over the phone.

Me: ""Sir, even if I could sell tickets right now, I would not be able to, all ticket transaction have to be done in person""

Guest: ""You know what, this is bullshit. All I want is to take my family to the famous park. Why can't you fucking help me you asshole!?""

I'm just fed up at this point. 

Me: ""Sir....the. park. is. closed. go on their website and look for yourself. Goodbye sir.""

Guest: ""Fuck you!""

Me: ""Thank you."" \*click\*

"Personally haven't felt much like posting been dealing with a lot but I figured hey these people really deserve their stories be told. I'll start with the simple Intended use story.

Around 12pm a woman came up from a 1st floor room and let me know her boyfriend should be coming to get keys to come visit her. She was barely dressed with a case of beer, she went on and talked about how she was going to have a good night. I waited all night and no one showed up for the keys. She came up around 6am and told me she wanted a refund because her boyfriend never showed up. I blankly stared at her and was like ""Mam' I am sorry but you used the room and I can't give you a refund."" She threw her hands down on the desk and yelled ""I didn't use it for it's intended use"". 

I really had no patience for this lady my manager came in and asked her to leave. Sorry lady I can't refund because you could have relations with your boyfriend in our hotel.

The next story is crazy only because I watch 90 Day  Fiancé on TLC. I really feel like this couple would be on this show. 

I walked in one night to come on at 11pm like I always do and there is a lady at the desk asking our new agent to help her find her boyfriends room. She had been there the night previous and didn't remember how to find it or which number it was. I asked for a name and room number and when she couldn't say the number of the room I let her know ""We can't just give out information."" She was pretty insistent that her boyfriend was the name on the room. It was a very obscure name and I remember telling her over and over again she needed to go. So the next night she comes in with an elderly woman like super elderly. Which I am guessing is her mom as she is pretty old herself. She looks to be in her 40's at least. 

""I know his room now!"" She sang as she passed slowly helping her mom shuffle slowly. 

Not even ten minutes later she is leaving the room I only know because I had went to the bathroom and saw them. She waved bye at me and left, I got a good look into who is in the room. The man she was seeing was a man who had been in house for a long time. He is from another country and is a younger guy. I mean I am 26 and he's my age, so comparatively she is a lot older. Well here is where this got awkward for me. He comes up every morning and talks to me, just random chit-chat. He asks about my infant son and how everything is going. When his woman walks in mad as heck, her face was scrunched up and red when she came stomping in. 

""How can you sit here and tell me you aren't cheating on me! I bet she didn't give me your room cause she was coming in her with you while she is on the clock!"" She was yelling so loud at this guy who was barely even reacting. Slowly blinking just letting her yell at him while I am just in shock frozen. 

""That's why you rushed us out you wanted to be a lone with her! I can't believe this how am I to get married to you when I can't trust you not to hit on other women. I just won't marry you!"" She was crying at the point. 

While frozen in the chaos of this woman I didn't see my boyfriend walk in waiting for me to go home with him. He was trying hard not to laugh I could tell. 

""I don't need to marry you, I just won't get a visa to be here anymore. This woman is just being friendly nothing more. You are a Jealous woman! It's not ok for you to speak to ME this way! Leave!"" He yelled this and walked away I assume to head to work. 

""Mam. I really-"" She stopped me before I explained and told me she would be getting proof from the cameras that I wasn't sleeping with her boyfriend. 

""I assure you Mam, my girlfriend here is not sleeping with your friend. She and I are together and have been for many years."" My boyfriend chimed in before my manager who was behind the desk. 

My manager laughed and stated it was true and that she wasn't going to show her footage for this. I laughed it off but she still comes in some nights. I guess they made up? But she watches me closely every time now though. 

Anyways there's my stories if ya didn't like them I am sorry not much has been happening and the stuff that does is always the commonality of working here. I also fell into a deep apathetic pit of a person so it's been eh lately.

"EDIT: I received a call this afternoon saying that my hours *will* be cut to three days a week. So there's that.

Hi folks.

Normally I *love* posting about the ridiculous Karens and Chads, the Twilight Zone sh\*t that happens to me during NA, and the occasional heartwarming tale.

But right now we are hurting and I need to blow off some steam.

First of all, a confession.

I was absolutely one of those folks who was dismissive when Corona started. People would talk to me about it and I would chalk it up to media fear-mongering. I am American and had no idea just how devastated China, Italy, and several other countries already were.

After a day or two of research and further development, I realized that I was wrong, and also kind of a dillhole. (Even if it was ""normal flu"" those are literal human lives taken by an illness.)

Second point- my hotel is currently going through the same upheaval most of yours are. The Powers that Be are sitting down today to discuss who gets the chop, which services to let go, etc.

Well, yours truly is a full time Night Auditor and my AGM told me last night that my hours wouldn't be impacted. At all.

I should be grateful, but I feel like I have survivor's guilt. How could it possibly be okay that I still have five days a week at my normal pay as we are literally cutting *entire departments* of the hotel.

Call it a luck of the draw, or tell me I've earned it by still coming to work during this sh\*t storm, but I don't feel great about it. I offered to give a shift or two to my supervisor if that would make or break her job but I doubt it'll be accepted.

Third point- there are coworkers who are NOT taking this seriously. I asked them if they had wiped down the elevator buttons and front desk like we were supposed to and they just scoffed at me. But seriously, they aren't cleaning anything due to you know, \~laziness\~ and I hope it doesn't impact anyone.

My whole point here, and there isn't much of one since I just needed to vent, is that we'll get through this. Things will bounce back, it's just hard to see right now because we're in the thick of it. Help when you can and wash your damn hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;Stay a while, and listen!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Ever have that one coworker who just doesn't get it? For whom basic tasks are mysterious and unknowable? 

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of incompetence, and the pain it caused your humble narrator. The taco place has shut down, so I'm feeling kind of grouchy tonight.

It is the job, nay the sacred and holy *duty* of the Night Auditor to catch and fix mistakes made by our coworkers. Were it not for that, our job could be done by a well-trained Golden Retriever. But our coworkers are not perfect beings.

I have spoken of '[Andrea] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/d5w0ww/horrible_coworker_is_horrible/)' before. But for all her faults, Andrea was at least competent. 'Morgan' was not.

Morgan was very good with guests, nice and polite, very friendly. But she was also pretty much incapable of anything but the most basic of tasks. Totally. She could could check people in, she could check people out. And that was it. And even then she would mess up.

I try *very* hard to avoid calling people 'stupid', 'idiot', or any other intelligence-based insults, but the fact of the matter is, this girl just was not very bright at all.

Any shift she worked meant my audit took an extra hour fixing her damn mistakes. That is not hyperbole, exaggeration, or anything, it really was that awful. Corporate would frequently call and say ""Hey, why haven't you done your Audit yet?"" and I would have to explain that there were still six more billing issues to resolve.

Could *not* do OTCs - customer card, every damn time. 

Could *not* do room rate adjustments - forgot about taxes, every damn time.

Guest's card declining? Check them in anyway! In fact, just swipe the card without running the authorization, that way it won't decline!

But the worst was that she would try to *fix* her mistakes, and do so incorrectly. Which meant she had to fix it again. And would do so incorrectly. On a good day, she would give up and leave it for me to deal with.

On a bad day...

Her magnum opus had one folio with *seventeen* rate adjustments, the customer's card charged *three times* (for different amounts), a balance of double the rate as a *negative* amount, and *everything* was billed under the (non-taxed) Room Service account code, including the tax.

The kicker? It was correct the whole time. She didn't need to fix *anything*.

But that wasn't the problem. The larger issue was that she simply wouldn't learn from her mistakes. She would be told 'don't do that', nod agreement, then turn right around and do it again.

I personally told her to stop using the Room Service account for making changes no less than eight times. It just... didn't stick. Nothing did. Same mistakes, every time she worked. So I had to tediously double check everything to make sure I hadn't missed anything.

We should have gotten rid of her. But she was good with customers, we were a bit short-handed (the manager had just started her first round of chemo), and nobody *else* saw the mistakes she was making...

So, I started documenting the hell out of things. Every night, pad of paper, 'Room 101 - wrong amount charged', 'Room 203 - customer card not valid', and so forth. Not just her - gotta be fair - but when you're literally making ten times the mistakes of the entire rest of the staff combined...

She eventually left. Apparently to take a course on becoming a pharmacist. Someone is going to *die* because she'll give the wrong dosage or medicine.

"Ok, so I'm rare to post about drama. That being said I'm posting about drama.

For the last couple of weeks I've been noticing issues with tons of reservations and as an auditor I have to fix them. I've told the offending parties how they need to be doing stuff but they won't listen because I'm not a manager. 

This morning I write out a wall of text to our GM who also happens to own the property about all of the issues that have been popping up the last couple of weeks leaving out any names. He responds with ""Ok. I'll talk to them."" He clearly knew who the offending parties are. 

Fast forward to my shift. I come in at 10:40 like normal and neither of our front desk workers are talking to me. Giving me the cold shoulder doesn't work. We are not in a profession where you can ignore your coworkers. I proceed as normal asking pertinent questions seeing as how we jumped from an expected 20% occupancy to 70%. Nothing. Then I read the log book and there is a printed note taking a whole page like a damn scrapbook with the issues being clarified and a ""quote of the day"" attached to the bottom reading ""you never good trying to make someone else look bad.""

Apparently I'm the only one around here doing the job properly and El Jefe came down like a tungsten rod from space on everyone but me. (Protip: I've known El Jefe for almost 20 years and he knows I only care about the property.) So i send him a picture of the note in the book to show how petty his front desk staff is. He responds with ""It doesn't really matter. Lol""  this is why I love my boss. Basically he's like to hell with it. It's an issue that needed addressing and it got addressed. Don't fuck up again.

Mr. X: Well, I was on my way from Toronto to your hotel (Which is located in Quebec City) and my connecting flight in montreal was canceled, and given that it's almost midnight, getting a bus or renting a car is going to be too much of a pain, so I'll be staying here instead.

I tried to press the button for floor 1 to get the door to open again before taking off, but the elevator wasn't having any of it. Thankfully, it's midnight and no one was around, so I took the elevator up, and back down to my waiting trash. On the bright side I got to wipe down the 4th floor elevator call button.

Another thing that made me happy: going thru restaurant receipts from yesterday and saw an older couple (senior discount) had breakfast and tipped their server a few dollars more than the total!

I recently ran into a lot of tension and complaints from my boss (to be fair sales are shit and covid isn't helping). It has made me want to quit because I only work a few days here, I have other jobs &amp; one lined up to replace this one, and I'm a student majoring in a completely different field. 

Despite this, I have had some majorly sweet guests recently. Here's a quick tale of a few of them!! (Hope multiple tales are not against the rules)

 Please leave your tales of sweet guests in the comments! 

*Guy who brought me expensive Mexican food* 

I'm on a diet but this guy came and offered Joe T Garcias (a cash only, hella good mexican food place in TX). I couldn't say no and it was such a great night! They brought so much and I ate all of it lol.They are regulars. 

*Guy who offered to take pool towels to the pool for me*

Came up and asked for pool towels and I told him I'd go and replace them in just a moment (I know I shouldn't do this but I usually let them come up to me if the pool is full because then they overuse them and trash the area). He goes ""Let me take them down for you!"" I was so surprised and told him I would but he insisted. He comes back about 30 mins later and I thanked him again. He told me they were empty again and he'd take some down again. He even waited outside the pool to finish his beer (no drinks allowed in pool). Sooo sweet.

*Lady who thanked me for not saying room # aloud &amp; for taking precautions for Covid* 

As soon as she walks in and reads the breakfast sign she said she appreciated me for wearing gloves and shutting down bkfst. After check in, she comes down to the front and thanked me for not saying her room aloud. Her husband called me a Disney princess cause thats in my name lol. Very cute. 

*Workers who wanted to cook meat for me* 

As opposed to some of my coworkers, I'm a little lax on hanging out in the lobby/bkfst area and eating. They asked to hangout and I said it was not a problem. I went to replace the coffee trash and they go ""Do you want us to fix you some bbq? Just get us some meat and we will cook you some steak!"". Every night they asked how I was before I could ask them and offered food. Sweet as hell! 


Leave sweet stories in the comments, this can be a hella depressing field of work sometimes.I have encountered a rare species of sweet guests",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"All this craziness over the coronavirus made me remember a situation from a few years ago. Couldn't post about it then due to low karma.

So I dealt with a Karen when Hurricane Irma was heading our way. Our lodging is located in a Zone A area (the riskiest area that would undoubtedly be hit the hardest). So we start making endless calls and emails to inform guests that we'd have to cancel their reservations since the order was given that anyone in Zone A must evacuate immediately. We get a call from Karen being absolutely furious that we are cancelling her reservations over ""some hurricane"". Eventually our manager got it through her head that we were in a state of emergency and our area was deemed unsafe.

We ended up getting a bit lucky since Irma shifted into the opposite direction. We still took extensive damage but most of our buildings faired well. That was the year Puerto Rico was hit terribly. There is a military base there so they all needed to be evacuated to the nearest functional base possible which was where we were at. This Karen calls back 2 days after Irma passed and said, ""Since you weren't affected at all (we were) I should be given better accommodations at no cost for this whole inconvenience."" The unit she wanted to upgrade to was what was damaged the most. All of those units are near the beach side and every single one had severe roof damage. Disregarding that fact, we also still couldn't let her stay because we needed to take in all the evacuees from the base in Puerto Rico.

She was furious before but she became enraged after hearing that. She was screaming and saying, ""What the hell is my family supposed to do now? My reservation should have been a guarantee that you could accommodate us but you're completely breaking that agreement. We have tickets for Disney so if we don't have a place to stay, we can't go. Those evacuees have no right taking our reservation. Why can't they just stay home? They're ruining everyone else's plans that were made well in advance.""

I was shocked. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. First, they can't complete their duties in a base that has no electricity. Second, what home are they supposed to stay at when the hurricane basically demolished them all? Third, this is not because of some vacation. They did not plan for a hurricane and are not doing this out of spite. They came to us because they were ordered to. They didn't come by choice. Whereas Ms. Karen was coming because she wanted to. She felt that she and her family were entitled to have a fun vacation over those who had nowhere to go.

Right now we're heading in the direction of possibly closing down again. We haven't had to cancel reservations yet but I did already have a guy that got pissy over me not making his reservation for next week since we are currently on standby. I guess we'll be seeing where this goes sooner rather than later. Hope you all fare well during this hectic time.Karen was entitled to her vacation over evacuees.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My GM posted the cutback schedule yesterday morning. She sat everyone down a few days ago and explained the situation...that everyone's hours would be getting cut back...offered alternatives like voluntary layoffs to collect unemployment...things like that. She kept reiterating it for several days, and made clear that the cut hours were nothing personal, and they were trying to keep as many people on as possible.

Well, apparently the new schedule didn't sit too well with my fellow FD worker ""Anita."" She began furiously texting my AGM last night about it, particularly pissed that I was getting 4 days this upcoming week while she was getting 3. AGM tried to explain that the 4 days weeks would be rotating among the remaining dayshift FDAs, to be as fair as possible. 

Nope, Anita wouldn't have it. She insisted that I was being catered to and that she should get at least 4 days a week, every week, since she's been there the longest (she's been there 3 months longer than me and has a spotty attendance record...to put it nicely). All this is over text message at like 9pm by the way. She couldn't have done this at the end of her shift earlier in the day when both my GM and AGM were there in person to talk about it.

So apparently today, before Anita's shift starts at 7am, she bursts into my GM's office and starts yelling at my GM, using all kinds of vulgarities (there were a lot of dicks in asses references)...basically reiterating her points, but doing so loud enough that the few guests we DO have can hear it out in the lobby.

My GM shows an uncharacteristic amount of tolerance for this behavior...I'm guessing because she didn't want to create even more of a scene than what already was happening, and the situation finally diffused. But Anita still seems to think that she's entitled to some kind of special treatment around here, which I don't get. It's particularly disappointing because she and I are pretty tight and I've always wished her nothing but success. I always keep an eye out for reviews that mention her name and print them for her, and I cover for her when she's sick or needs time off (happens A LOT). Kind of sucks that she's trying to shit on me during a time where we need to all stick together.

Anita is definitely going to lose her shit when she finds out my GM is appointing me acting AGM when our AGM goes on maternity leave for 3 months. But, behavior like today is just one more thing my GM can point to if Anita asks why she got passed over. She's just digging her own grave.

Update: After a day of reflection and giving her the benefit of the doubt, chalking it up to stress...turns out she called out of her shift today. Jesus Christ on a cracker...Cutbacks show people's true colors",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"to start of on this lovely slow Monday morning. apparently ppl traveling from overseas are exempt from social distancing.  First guy who came to get breakfast deciding he was going to eat his breakfast standing right in front of all the food laid out for half an hour. 

he kept coughing into his hands then immediately touched EVERYTHING, he even took bread with freshly coughed in hands and put a slice back(tongs were right in front of him) bruuuhhh. I fully disinfected everything he touched and threw the few slices of bread he touched away. 

I don't have the luxury to distance myself from you sir, please leave the lobby if you don't need to be in here. get your food and leave! 

i get it's the morning and your brain is not turned on yet but common sense my dude!! these types of ppl are the reason why this shit spreads so easily. 

stop traveling lol your American vacation can wait.

for more info i work at a small property to where I will still have full hours and nothing is getting cut for me, or the housekeeping/maintenance staff will all be here 24/7. even if we have zero people all week I'd still have full hours. 

can we all just fast forward a few months and be done with this bs :( hate feeling like the bad guy for reminding people to use common sense 

also while we're on the topic EVERY single guest who checks out wants to personally hand me their dirty room keys. I've seen people treat those keys like a lollipop..I have to tell everyone to please set them on the counter (so I can Clorox tf out of all them keys)  gonna be a long few months here folks. 

stay safe everyone who's at bigger properties! its tougher for you guys and I'm sorry hours are getting cut n stuff. best wishes follow FD agents!!it's the most wonderful time of the year",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So at my hotel our food and beverage is lucky to still be operating.   
The only reason it hasn't is because it's a brand standard to have a full service bar and restaurant open. 

Well we close at midnight for the bar and restaurant.   
Cue to me working audit tonight and of course at 12:30 I get a ton of check ins from a delayed flight. 

All of them are hungry and annoyed, none of them like my suggestions. 

Directly across the street is a 24 hour 7 eleven, down the street further is a Dennys and another diner.  
Everyone I have suggested to these options too has looked disgusted and stormed off like a toddler. 

I even had two different ladies say ""So what, I have to STARVE?""

Nope, you could walk across the street and buy food.  They 100% sell food at 7 eleven. 

""But I don't WANT that TRASH they sell!""

I mean they sell fruit too and veggie to-go items, they are 24 hours too so if you change your mind they will be open.

I just hate when people want options but then shit down my throat when their options are limited at 1am.Apparently a convenience store does not qualify as an option for food",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"First post here so please bear with me. So I work for a notable hotel chain. Our property has 225 rooms, a bar, restaurant, and IRD. Now, just like every other hotel in this dimension, we charge a security/incidentals fee. The fee is 25% of the room and tax for the whole stay.  So I'm working the front desk one night and this lady comes sauntering in, and she just has *the look.* The look that says ""I'm going to ruin your life."" So she comes up to me and she was actually nice to me at first. Asking me how my day was, smiling, just being generally pleasant. Now, our chain, like most, has an honors program and this guest was in our second highest tier. We'll call her the ""Precious Metal Member."" So now we arrive to the point in the check-in process where I need to get her card info, and I'm explaining the deposit to her. She just nods. The total pops up and she raises an eyebrow, that's when I knew that she was about to make the remainder of our time together, absolute HELL.

Precious Metal Member: Why is that number so high? What is my rate?

Me: Your rate is $xx.xx. So we're authorizing the room. tax, and the security deposit which is 25% of the room and tax.

Precious Metal Member: Okay.

So she confirms the amount and her card declined. A look of pure fury passed over her face and I was so not mentally prepared for this.

PMM: Why did my card decline??

Me: I am not sure ma'am my computer doesn't tell me why a card declines, it just tell me that it declines.

PMM: Well can I do the room and tax on one card, and the deposit on another?

Now, technically, according to my specific property's policy, I am not allowed to do that. However, I just want to get this lady checked in and away from my desk, so I don't care. So I tell her that I can do that for her and I make the necessary adjustments. Now, I more care about procuring the room and tax more than the security deposit so I run the auth for the former first. And guess what happens. Yup, you guessed it. Her card declines. Her face went the brightest shade of red I have ever seen. Like I did not think it was possible for someone to go this red. I thought she was going to go full Anger from Inside Out.

PMM: ""THERE IS MONEY ON MY CARD TELL ME WHY ITS DECLINING, HERE LOOK!!

she then proceeds to shove her phone into my face with her bank info on it, and there was indeed money on her card but I have no idea why her card is declining so I repeat myself and tell her that I can't see why her card declines. After going back and forth with her, about this she asks me waive our deposit, keep in mind I hadn't even authorized for the deposit yet, just the room and tax. So I tell her

Me: Ma'am I have no way to waive the security deposit. And this was also for the room and tax not the depoist.

PMM: Well wtf! I used this card the last time I stayed her! Just waive the fees and give me my room.

Me: I can't do that ma'am. 

PMM: Well I'm a Precious Metal Member and I cannot believe that this is how I am being treated! I demand to be treated better!

Now, I have been working in the customer service industry for nearly a decade, and have seen every honors program under the sun. I legit do not care. So I apologize to the guest for how she feels she is being treated. yada yada yada, but she is hearing none of it.

PMM: You know what, just cancel my reservation, I'll stay somewhere else.

Me: Of course ma'am (I say monotone while I am jumping for joy inside that this woman is leaving)

Little does she realize that if her card declined her, it's gonna decline wherever she goes. So that's my story. Thank for taking the time to read lol.Lady feels should be exempt from our deposit policy",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I only ask because my hotel may not be doing so hot. 

 We are not much slower than usual, unlike most of you.  Our schools have been shut down, but no shutdown of of anything else except voluntarily.  I live in the heart of Trump and science-denier country.  Locals are still moving about as usual for the most part, but of course all the Walmarts are out of toilet paper, canned goods, and such.

Okay, so today I had a lady come down and ask ""Can I get some tissue?"" (Which, sidenote, always confuses me for a split second as I instinctively associate that terminology with Kleenex instead of toilet paper.)  

I get her a roll, no big deal.

A couple minutes later a kid comes and also asks for a roll.  I get him one.  But when a third kid comes down 15 minutes later, I ask him what room he's from and it's the same room I know the lady from earlier was in... I still give him one, as I don't want to start a fight over fucking toilet paper, so what if they need three extra rolls to take home, it's difficult to find in stores right now, right? 

Plus we've got plenty in the back.  Or so I think.

...butt actually...  

...we keep some toiletries in a drawer at the front desk to have on hand to give to people right away, so that's where I've been getting this toilet paper from.  However, I've now given away 3 rolls and it's time to replenish it from the housekeeping storage room.  And when I go back there, I'm shocked to see that our stock of TP has diminished dramatically from two days ago.  We're a small hotel and normally we only get a supply truck every week or two, and the big box of TP that we get in that shipment easily lasts that amount of time, even if we're busy.  I'm not sure how many rolls are in there, 200 or so? - but they fill up a plastic storage shelf when unpacked.  When I was there last, on Friday night third shift, the shelf was mostly full.  Now there are only like 15 rolls left at the very very back.

 So when a man comes down after that and also asks for some, I ask what room he's in, and then tell him I just gave the lady and little boy from that room two rolls, and that housekeeping will be here in less than 3 hours with more if they've used it all.  (I don't mention the second kid because I didn't ask his room number, but I'm postive they have three extra rolls up there.) He thanks me and goes away, *sans* TP.   

Next they send down a little girl, the youngest yet, maybe six or seven.  When I ask what room she's in she doesn't know, but Mommy told her to ask for tissue.   It isn't unusual for people to send their kids down for stuff, but still, she's little and I don't really want to give them another roll so I call the room and ask if this is their daughter.   

Yes, she is.

Well, I'm afraid we're running rather low on rolls of ""tissue"" and I know I've given ya'll 3 in the past hour or so.

And then the mom just breaks down pleading- she's not sure if she can buy any when she gets home, she's from a few states away and all her friends say everything is out in her hometown and everything is out in the stores here, and she knows she is low at her house, can she please just have one more last roll.

So I sigh and say, sure, if you promise to write us a good review, in a kind-of joking voice, and she agrees., and I send the kid back up with her prize.

I'll have to ask my manager if she knows what happened to the rest... maybe (hopefully) she has moved them to a more secure location, or maybe staff or even a guest has has broken into housekeeping and stolen them. 

  Edit:  or maybe guests are really just asking for more on all shifts, not just mine?  Are you guys getting these requests?

"Good Evening, or I guess morning for most people. As you can probably tell from that, I work overnight as a night auditor/MOD for a resort in California. Long time reader, first time poster all that jazz. 

Usually, I’m more accustomed to drunk guests coming up to me in a drunken delirious rants, puking on the front drive, cracking jokes at me about being tired at 4am, and whining about what a travesty it is to not have complementary coffee set up in the lounge instead of the coffee assortment we provide in the room. 

Anywho, even though we’re less than 20% tonight, I’ve had a handful of guests either come up to the desk or call the front desk to randomly start conversations about how corona virus is a myth and the government is trying to control us with the media scare. Insert one guest who walked in from down the street and was yelling at me about if I believe in all this I must be fucking crazy. One guest led off the conversation based on my name (very asian name) and then turned it into a corona virus rant and how someone he knows had it and was perfectly fine. Ok sir, thank you for making me aware to not shake your hand, let’s elbow bump instead. 

All the while, I’m surprised people haven’t been trying to sneak into our restrooms to steal toilet paper yet. One of my concierge has a theory that when most of our departments were suffering from a mini plague of sorts between December and February, it was in fact corona virus. Although, to be fair, I almost believe her considering how sick many of us got for 1-2 months each and we do have people traveling from all over to join us here as well. 

I’m sure all of you have also been hit hard occupancy wise due to the ongoing virus situation also, so we’ve cut back all our agents to less than 30 hrs each this week. Hopefully all of you are doing ok on hours, staying safe, staying healthy, and staying sane amongst the craziness.

"Still pissed off after this.  I start my shift and there's a guy in the lobby on the phone yelling at the other person.  I tell him to take his conversation outside because people in the hotel are trying to sleep.  He does for a while.

He comes back and he's still yelling into his phone, only now he has the person on speakerphone.  I tell him he'll need to leave or I will have to call the police.  I can hear the person on the other end telling him to quit yelling, and the dude denies it, but instead blames it on me being a racist.

"I'm absolutely frustrated with all the people who ask for rates, and once I tell them, try to cajole me into giving them a better price because of the CORVID-19 situation. 

Just had a gal come in, immediately giving me the ""It's my birthday and I've always wanted to stay here!"" treatment, which is always a warning signal. She asked for the rate of our fourth tier room. It's already been massively discounted, but it isn't a good enough price for her, of course. 

""The parking lot has barely any cars in it, are you sure that's your best price?"" She says. 

I tell her the rate for our other room types, and she is appalled that I would even suggest such a thing. No, she needs a king room with the fireplace and patio! 

She declares that she is just going to book on Slow-tels Thisnight, and I cheerfully let her know she'll be getting a standard queen. 

""This is so stupid. You have empty hotel rooms just sitting here! It's my birthday and I'm quarantining starting tomorrow, I can't believe you won't just lower the fucking rate. You should be discounting""

"Me: Good Morning,. Thank you for calling___, how may I assist you?

Idiot: My name is Idiot. Two months ago you had ___ event at your hotel that my daughter was a part of. I had been thinking of making a reservation to come watch her, but never made the reservation, but now my card was charged for the night.

Me: (looks up reservation in guest history and sees that it was charged a no show fee) Sir, we wouldn’t have had your credit card on file for a reservation in your name unless you actually made the reservation. 

Idiot: But I just went online and thought about making it. I didn’t actually do it. 

Me: Sir, my records show that you made this reservation on ___(date long before the reservation). This was for a sold out event and you never called to cancel so you were rightly charged a no-show fee.

Idiot: But I can’t find anything in my email with a confirmation number so that proves that I didn’t actually make the reservation for my daughters event. You need to give me my money back. 

Me: Sir, once again you would have had to give your credit card number to put on the reservation in order for us to have had it to charge. We aren’t responsible for whether you can find an email months later. 

Idiot: Well I guess I’ll just do a chargeback and you’ll have to give me my money back anyway.

Me: Sir, you may choose to try that, but we have the records that you made the reservation and that it was for your daughters event. The terms you agreed to when you made the reservation had a 48 hour cancellation window after which a cancellation or no show would be charged a one nights stay. You never cancelled and did not show up, so you were rightly charged. 

Idiot: Don’t talk to me about all that legal stuff. I don’t remember making the reservation.

"So at my hotel, our late check out is at 1 sharp, any minute later and its another nights charge. My last check out had requested a late one. I go up and tap on their door to see if they need any extra time, as they are snowflake members. They don't even open the door, talk to me through it. Fine, whatever. I go about my business till about 12:55, still no sign of them leaving. I give them a call, wife answers and said they're rushing, has an attitude about it, I politely say that fine and hang up. At 1 the husband comes down, says ""I'm checking out at 1 and I need a luggage cart"" I point to them, and I inform him that I'll give them 10 extra minutes to leave, something I'm not supposed to do. Instead of thanking me, he proceeds to say all pissy ""Yeah, I get it, we're leaving. If I'm right outside the door with my shit, are you still gonna FUCKING charge me???"" I say nothing to this as he continues to curse about me under his breath all the way to the elevator. At 1:06, they are leaving. Husband says ""its 1:05 and were out, you better not have charged me."" At this point, the ""fake ass politeness"" comes out in me, and I say ""oh don't you worry, you weren't. Would you like a receipt?"" He goes ""You know what, yes I would. I swear to god, if you fucking charged me I'll be pissed"" as the printer spits out his paper, I repeat ""don't worry, you weren't"" hand him the paper, he storms out.

"Like I am genuinely confused by customers calling me to look up addresses or our address. Don't get me wrong if they come to the front desk and ask me where something is I will give them the address. I am talking about the guest that call me to have me look up an address. Besides our hotel address I will need to lookup all addresses on google.

Like okay so how did you get my number to call me? I highly doubt you looked it up in a phone book (literally who has those anymore). If you googled my number you have the hotel address right there! Also if they got our phone number off a business card, email signature, whatever our address would be attached to it as well.

I just got a call from a guest asking where the Book Store was. I don't mind looking up the address but don't you think it is much quicker to use the phone that you used to google our number to google the book stores address (guest knew the name of the book store) instead the guest called me to ask me to look up the address which then I had to google, tell him the address while he had speaker phone and put it into his maps.... like WHAT kind of boomer shit is this..???

"Had a guest call to cancel yesterday. 

She said the Third Party phone had a NINE HOUR wait to talk to someone.

After my initial shock wore off, I informed her, again, that she does need to call and speak to them to cancel and get a refund.

She asked if we could ""like, send them a message or something."" I said, ""no ma'am. I'm so sorry, but you do need to speak with them to cancel.""

Had someone else call for rate info for this week and was unsure if they would check in tomorrow or a couple days from now and asked about the third parting rate she was looking at. I told her to book it if the rate is low, but for the love of god DO NOT PREPAY!!

"So this had happend ages ago so not a customer related story but something to do with a certain dm we have who is quite horrible at times 

Just a side note this day there were three on and one of them who is supposed to wear a blazer isn't wearing it so yeah 

So one day I'm asked to help the day porter and I say absolutely fine more then happy to now when I'm on shift I ask him can I take off my waistcoat that I have to wear for the front desk and he says it's fine she hasn't told me he's in charge but I assume he is because he's my superior teaching me how to do his job and I ask him if I can go for a fag he says yes I use my break sparingly she comes in says how evrerything is going its all good im learning alot happy with it all

Then when I'm done with that she asks me to help with housekeeping to which I respond again happy to i go upstairs but before i can she goes

Dm: why are you not wearing a waistcoat
Me: I was working with porter who doesn't wear one so I was trying to be like him
Dm: well you have to let me know whenever you do that
Me: OK then why isn't other dm wearing her blazer
Dm: um um I'm. Not sure but you still. Need to wear it
Me: OK then

Then I head upstairs now I wanna note I've never done housekeeping before a day in my life but its nice to learn new skills head upstairs to one of the housekeepers and ask them what to do as anyone would do they tell me what to do and it's just basically ripping sheets off and taking them to the hosikeeping carts unfortunately I'm not the fastest but the HSK team understand except her she decides to pop her head in again and go how is everything and finds me going slowly again another conversation ensues

Dm: how is everything
Me: fine I'm a bit slow
Dm: why haven't you emptied the bin
Me: I thought I was stripping beds
Dm: no it's more then that you need to tidy the actual room
Me: OK then (goes kind of slowly)
Dm: why is this room not done yet come on I need you to speed up *in a very harsh tone*
Me: OK sorrry
Dm: make sure it goes to the carts aswell as the bins
Blah blah blah

Then I'm asked to empty all the trash into a bin and apparently I'm doing that wrong aswell again another conversation

Dm: what are you doing it's wrong you need to make sure the bags are in the wheelie bucket not a trolly

"I know many of us are tired of hearing about COVID, but today a guest checked in from NY who was coughing and overall didn't look well. He told my coworker not to worry, he doesn't have coronavirus. But it still made me super nervous. Not to mention we have absolutely zero clorox wipes or hand sanitizer here. We are wearing gloves (if we want to, not mandatory), and have been advised to wipe down elevator buttons and door knobs in the lobby with our bathroom disinfectant a few times a shift. But I don't think anyone is actually doing this except me and maybe 2 other coworkers. Two other coworkers that I mentioned this policy/suggestion too just rolled their eyes.


Being 5 months pregnant, and being around guests travelling all day, this has me a bit nervous. I'm wondering what I can and should do to protect myself. If a guest walks up to the desk coughing and from a state with a bad outbreak, what should I do? Check them in from 6 feet away by asking them to stand back? Once they leave, how can I disinfect the area without infecting myself (I heard it can be in the air for up to 30 minutes where someone coughed, I had no clue that was even possible)? 


I have people walking right up to the desk and leaning over it to talk to me at check in or to ask questions, I don't know how I can avoid it?Coughing guest from NY checked in earlier, I am 5 months pregnant and very nervous about catching COVID.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Brief story. We are allowed to have quarantines here, but they are under strict rules not to leave the room at all, and they get no service. There have not been any cases in my city.

Also, I am scared as all hell of this sort of thing. Watched a miniseries when I was younger that stuck with me.

So, I get a really late reservation, around 3AM, for a weeklong stay. Which is pretty uncommon. Usually people who are coming for a week or longer, know they are coming ahead of time.

I greet him at the desk, he has a Hospital bracelet and a cotton ball taped to his arm where blood has been drawn.

Red flag. I quickly glance to see if we have hand sanitizer near the desk still.

I start making small talk with the guy. Ask him what brings him to my city. His answer was ""Traveling""... 

Ugh. Red flag #2. Who travels and the first thing they do when they get here is go to the hospital? 

I go through the check in process, because even if he has it we are supposed to let them stay, and at the end I just straight up ask him if he is being quarantined. He says no. Ok... Anxiety drops down a level.

As soon as he leaves I look up testing for the virus. Thankfully, Bloodtests don't seem to be involved at all. Anxiety subsiding...

I must have scrubbed my hands for 15 minutes. I still used sanitizer after.

Part of me still thinks he has it. I hate this stuff.Sir, are you being quarantined?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I know this isnt necessarily a story about the hotel, but I'm curious to see if this kind of thing is happening all over.  

It was a great place to work when I first started, but after 6 years it was awful so I quit. They fired the entire concierge team a couple months before the virus hit, so they were obviously already losing a lot of money, but it's hard to imagine they're going to survive this hard a hit.The hotel I worked at for almost 6 years just fired every spa associate, and over half of the kitchen crew. They're also cutting hours in every department down to 3 days a week.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"There was a guest staying for three nights at the hotel. For those who don’t know me, I’m a guest service manager at a hotel chain located in a resort town. 

The guest had racked up plenty of room charges and the night to night. From reports from my staff he was a generous tipper but the woman staying in the room (her name was on the reservation) was belligerent and buying 60 dollars worth of alcohol a night. 

This morning the generous tipper asked for an upgrade and that they’d stay another night if I could do it. Hells yeah I can. I’ll take whatever capitol I can. 

I upgraded him. He left with a smile on his face. 

A few minutes later a guest came down and reported that there was a woman and child banging on a door of a room on 3 (where I just upgraded the guest) and the woman was cursing like a sailor. I thanked the guest for notifying me and ran up to 3. By the time I got up there, no one was in the hall. 

When I got back to the desk the generous tipper had demanded that we remove his credit card from the room, that his whatever she was, would be paying. I took this with a grain of salt but did as requested. The man flew out of here like a bat out of hell. 

I called up to the room. No answer. 
I went up to the room. It was abandoned and the fresh room was completely trashed. I mean alcohol bottles on the floor, men’s clothing everywhere, abandoned tacos. Disgusting. I called the telephone number on file and got the belligerent woman. I told her I need a method of payment. She refused and said that the generous tipper was to take care of it because it wasn’t her responsibility. I told her it was because her name was on the room. She hung up on me. 

In the guests folio I saw the credit card that we had before making the change but my system encrypts all numbers except the expiration date and card type. 

Goddamn I’m an idiot. I should’ve never taken the credit card off. 

Only a few minutes ago I had realized I was able to post in my system using master card as a criteria and it allowed me to charge the previous card. 

In these weird times, people will try to take unnecessary advantage of others. If you’re working a hotel, be alert.

"Hey y’all! So working Night Audit tonight and this just happened a second ago....yeah this one is a first for me. So I’m in the back office just passing the time playing Zelda on my switch when the phone rings
LG= Lost Guy
Me= Me (obvi)

Me: Thank you for calling blah blah Suites this is Mrcupcake how can I help you?

LG: oh are you a robot?

Me: (already thinking this is a joke) no this is Mrcupcake at blah blah Suites how can I help you?

LG: oh! Hi.......so.........uuuuh.........ok so I’m in a bit of a.....predicament 

Me: Ok?

LG: so.....I lost my wife........and I’m with someone else’s wife...

Me: (really thinking now this is a joke but just want to see how long he can keep this up) I’m sorry.....I’m very confused

LG: so I lost my wife so if you find her can you call me?

Me: is she in this hotel? What does she look like?

LG: well she has really big breasts and...

Me: (facepalm) sir I don’t mean her anatomy I mean her hair color, what is she wearing? Also what is her name?

LG: oh! Brown hair, blue eyes (describes different types of clothing to the moon and back)

So I basically go back and forth with this guy and it kinda just repeats and I try to figure out what room he is in and he gives me his last name and what room he might be in because currently he is in someone’s room with someone’s wife that he does not know and he can’t remember his room number. At this point I believe he might be drunk but he was speaking and comprehending pretty well. He said that he had never been to our city before and he and his wife went downtown and met some other couples that were not very “into” their marriages (I’m assuming swingers) and when he got back he wound up in this woman’s room. But this is what really almost made me break employee character

Me: ok sir I will keep an eye out for her don’t worry, in the mean time why don’t we try to figure out what room your in?

LG: what am I going to tell my son?! (Saying this in a very sobbing kind of voice)

Me: oh no...sir it’s ok we will figure this out together don’t worry, can you tell me if the room is under yours and your wife’s name?

LG: (immediately recovers without missing a beat) honestly man I’m not sure

Me: (wait hold up what?! He recovered that quick) oh.......uh I see

LG: it’s all good man if you see her can you just call me?.....wait your at the front desk???

Me: yes sir I am

LG: actually I will just come down! See ya in a bit!

He hung up and it’s been about 20 mins and he hasn’t come down. But yeah thought that was really strange. Just when you think Night Audit gets boring you sometimes get guests that make it interesting haha

"I am an engineer in Louisville and things are looking bleak. Starting tomorrow we will be closing entire floors to save energy. (And money) From Wednesday to Friday our occupancy has dropped from 94% to less than 30%. I just clocked in and have yet to see how many cancellations were over the weekend. All events have been cancelled. In our department hours have been cut to 30 hours and I would not be shocked if half of us will be laid off soon. I only hope I can use the 4 weeks of PTO I have banked to make up the difference. Starting Monday we will be shutting floors down. All power will be cut and hot water building loops closed. We will no longer be doing room P.Ms and cannot buy any supplies to maintain the rooms. Once we are out of certain items, we will have to take parts from out of service rooms. Our 5 star bar and restaurant has taken a huge hit as well. On a Friday night during dinner rush servers had no tables. They are already having to dip into savings. 

Im a bit worried. The Kentucky Derby brings billions to this area. Two weeks before the race we kick things off with an all day airshow followed by one of the worlds largest fireworks show. It is called Thunder over Louisville. I cant even describe the amount of people that pour in from all over the country just for Thunder. Each day after are special events and parades. The waterfront of the Ohio river is filled with vendors and food trucks on both sides and is called the Chow Wagon. This is huge for Kentucky and Indiana. If everything from Thunder to Derby is cancelled a lot of folks are just plain screwed. 

I knew this virus was going to be bad and the timing of it could not be any worse. Our building is getting by with the bare minimum on all fronts. Im not sure how much longer we will be staying open. Its like we are all stuck in one huge nightmare. 

What is it like where you guys are at? What precautions have been taken? Have you been experiencing the same layoffs and massive budget cuts yet? Do you have anything you would like to get off your chest? What steps are being taken to help prevent the spread of the virus?

* A guy coming in asking to charge his phone because he didn't realize that battery life ends, even if you need to get an uber
* two drunk guys insisting they've just survived doomsday, the end of the world!
* The same two drunk guys who couldn't understand why we wouldn't give them our phone numbers.
* A ""time traveler"" who ensured us that our system could let her stay as long as we ""set it up for wage garnishments"" and,
* A man coming in insisting that because he had cholera, we were breaking the law by not letting him use the restroom and ""forcing him to shit his pants"".

He stated that his flight was delayed, but that his daughter is en route to the hotel, and her name is on the reservation to check in as well.  He doesn't want us to cancel the room.

Well, no worries...we won't cancel the room, and I thanked him to calling and giving me a heads up.   I asked if he wanted me to go on and check in the reservation.

Oh no.  My daughter will be there around midnight.

The daughter shows up...with 2 other young ladies.  They look as if they've been on spring break already -- tan, and beachy--looking.  They ask for the shuttle and speak of catching an early flight, but speaks nothing about her dad coming.  I ask how many keys she would like, she's says one, and doesn't ask that I make a key for her dad who is coming later.  I decide not to ask her any questions about this because things already don't add up.

They're booked into a queen.  3 lovely young ladies, yet the dad calls with this elaborate story about a delayed flight and won't make it until 1 pm.  Well, it is 2:28 am at the time of this writing.  Looks like he's a *no show*. \*eye roll\*  

Why lie?  

He could have just made the reservation, called the hotel and told us to put his daughter's name on  the reservation, and left it at that.  Why call with such a story?  That's why I didn't press the issue with the daughter about him arriving later.

"Hello my lovely auditors and front desk staffers! I hate today!!

So amidst all the COVID-19 drama, what with occupancy dropping at alarming rates, I thought I would be looking forward to a quiet Saturday. I was SO wrong. 

I walk in for my shift and the front desk is in chaos. They’re calling a room that had given me issues last night and warning the guest that they needed her to voluntarily check out by tonight or we would have to physically remove her. Okay, fine. One crazy person. 

While that’s being handled, we get word that our bar on property had to kick out a drunk individual who then wandered through our property and pulled their pants down to pee on a building. Security chased him off the property and so far he hasn’t returned. 

Once all the info from the first guest has been given to me, the police are called and we let them know that we may need them to remove a difficult guest. We call the room and the guest doesn’t answer. We send the guards up to knock and she doesn’t answer. The TV is playing loudly so they head down here to get a key to gain entry (since we already warned her she was to leave) and PD walked upstairs with them. 

Thankfully the room was vacated, but I’m on the edge of my seat waiting for the next problem to arise. How’s your weekend going?third shift dumpster fire",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

So night auditor, front desk, nice hotel. 

Phone: Ring ring etc.

I look at the caller ID and its an outside call so I answer and do my standard rehearsed greeting. The random lady says Hey yeah I'm in room X and the couple in room ""Y"" bless her heart is (well she doesn't say it as politely  but) having loud sex and me and my children can't sleep. She goes on for awhile about how much she payed and details about the noise. While she is doing this I look up room X because the fact she called me from her cell phone instead of the room phone seemed odd and I didn't think there was anyone in those rooms. Sure enough They were empty I try to tell the lady that I think she has the wrong room number or phone number while she is still going on and on about the loud sex. She get's real upset then and chastises me for interrupting her. So I just set the phone down for a moment and wait for it to sound like it's quieted down. 

finally Me: Mam what room did you say you were in again?  room X. Mam I think you have called the wrong hotel we don't have anyone in room X or Y for that matter.  she gets more upset and says she knows what hotel she called! I said OK miss do me a favor and call me back on your hotel room phone or come to the desk. She says FINE! hangs up, and I never hear from her again. no one shows up no one calls.

"I work at a hotel in the downtown area of a fairly large city with more than zero hot spots for drinking, and just had this doozy of a situation.

Earlier tonight, a guest came down asking for his car keys (we are valet parking only due to location).

He seemed sober and had his claim ticket, so I ran out to the closet where we keep the keys, grabbed his, and gave them to him after informing him of where our parking lot is (valet leaves at 11pm, normally; 9pm with the corona virus scare going on now).

That was about four hours ago.

Well just now, my buzzer for the front door goes off. I look outside and low and behold it’s that one guy...carrying his shoes??? And with another person.

Since I recognize him, I let him in and oh boy. Oh Jesus. His face is covered in lacerations and blood is dripping onto my lobby floor. 

His attendant informs that he - you probably guessed it - crashed his car.

And now I’m high key freaking out. I have no idea if other people were involved in this accident, I have no idea if he was drunk when I gave him his keys, and have no idea if I’m going to be held liable for this if he was, in fact, drunk at the time I handed off said keys.

Immediately I was thinking, ""did they lose the death certificate at our hotel, and who the hell loses a death certificate at a hotel?"" So I go and put her on hold then check the lost &amp; found for a death certificate, as expected, there were none there.

The lobby and desk are the most organized they have ever been in the history of the hotel and deserve to be in a magazine.. so organizing is out the window.

As some of you may have seen I had the unpleasant experience of having someone point their gun at me a few weeks ago during my night shift. So I have stepping up my security as to who I let in to the hotel at night.

I told her I couldn't help with her attitude and then she really went off so I just stopped replying. Then last night some guy comes around 2am asking to use the bathroom. Nope. Can I speak to a manager? Also nope. Tries to argue then leaves. COMES BACK 15 minutes later. How can I help you? Yeah can I use your bathroom? Nope. Bathroom is closed to non guests at this time.

Alright. It's 4am and there are 2 people hanging out in my vestibule. They make a weak attempt to get in then just stand out there for like 15 min. 

I get on the intercom to see what they need and they don't answer so I go to the door. As soon as I open it one tries to fly by me. I block it and ask what I can do for them. one says ""Oh, she just wants to get some water."" I'm like ""Oh, y'all guests with us tonight?"" The both say no so I'm like ""Yeah, sorry,, if you're not a guest I can't let you in."" Then the girl changes it to We'll we're kinda guests! and she cops a major attitude. I was confused so I was like ok, so you're guests. The 2nd one says no, and the pissy one says kind of. I was already over her attitude and trying to start my paperwork and in no mood for her shit. 

I was like Ok, either you're guests or your not. What's the name on the room? She spouts off a room number and again I ask for a name. She tells me some nickname, and I'm like yeah,, that's not gonna help. She chimes in with ""Well, that's all I can give you because that's all I know!"" I'm over the attitude dripping from this chick. so I tell them ""If you're not a guest, and cannot tell me who you're here to see, or manage to contact them yourself I need y'all to head on out.""

She busts into this tirade of ""Motherfucker, my car won't start, I'll leave when I get it started."" I cut it really short told them they need to leave like now. She again tells me she'll fucking leave when her car starts. I was like ok, you can leave on your own, or I'll just have the cops remove you. She says ""You know what you gotta do!"" so, I call the cops.

As soon as they pull up her attitude totally changes (The intercom is still on.) Cop comes in, gets my side and says they have a ride on the way and should be here in 10 min and asks if they can continue to wait because it's freezing rain. I'm hesitant but then he tells me they're confirm they have a ride coming and they'll hang out in the cruiser until the ride comes.  Fine,,, whatever. Cop goes out, and is back in like 3 minutes later tells me bitchy chick has a warrant and they'll be taking her with them and they'll take the other one home.

"Tonight was going great until I did something that I regretted immediately. I gave someone a room key without consent from the person in the room. The guy said he was her husband and that he needed a room key to her room, he then picked up his phone and said, “yes I’m here now,  I’ll be right up” as if he was on the phone with the person in the room. That told me, okay, the person in the room must know he is coming. I gave him the key and told him which room to go to and where it is. Not 30 seconds later I hear yelling and cursing and I run down to the room and what I guess is going on is the woman in the room was cheating or something because that’s what seemed to be the argument. I called the police and while I was on the phone the guy left and shortly after, the woman and the other guy she had been with did too. I know I messed up, this has never happened to me before. Usually handing out keys goes something like, “I need a key to this room,” I ask what the last name is then I give the key if they confirm. This time was different because he didn’t know the room number but he knew the name, and he tricked me into thinking that the person in the room knew he was coming. I’m stressing out over this because I know how stupid that was of me, but at the same time I feel like this could have happened to anyone.

"Soo, I'm not sure if you were aware but there's a virus going around.

My property is going through a renovation involving removing the old mattresses and bed bases. We informed everyone with a lovely letter in the room and in the lobby, and mentioned it at the front desk that we we're going to do it Friday. 
 
I get a call after finding out I was doing a double that someone may have forgotten the English language or has amnesia. 


A guest calls irate that his room wasn't cleaned; which was fine because he had the DND sign up. But that his bed was made. 

Me: ""Oh yes, we changed the mattress and bedframes in all the rooms, we left a letter in your room informing you of the changes and apologized for any inconveniences.""

Guy: ""but what about the corona virus!?""

Me: ""On the letter at the bottom there was a section asking our guest to sign and bring down to the desk if they were not comfortable with us going into the room during this trying time.""

Guy: ""well I didn't know! What if my room is affected!?""

Me: ""Sir, I'm looking at your account, you've been here for months and we gave you a letter.""

Guy:""but what is someone's affected!? Why didn't you reschedule?""

Me: "" I'm pretty sure they would not have come in if they were infected, also this was something we couldn't reschedule.""

Guy: ""Well if I get sick, I'm gonna blame you guys!""

"So,, my state has infected people but fatalities yet. 

Ttoday they called off public &amp; private schools through the end of the month, the 2 local colleges for a couple weeks, along with all the planned tournaments, and then they are mandating 100% on-line courses, the convention center a building away has effectively been closed though the end of April. (There was a rather big event scheduled there this morning that was cancelled last min because of the closure.)

The big box &amp; club stores are wiped out of TP &amp; water. (my grocery store is fine though.)

We had a shit ton of early checkouts today (because of the convention center), and a whole shit ton of cancellations for the coming weeks. (The convention center part is really really gonna hurt us.)

The owner came in to tell us about the convention stuff right after he left the meeting about it and mentioned those dreaded words,, ""skeleton crew"".

Luckily for me, I'm only one of two auditors so I'm ok. We have 3 new desk clerks and a few new housekeepers, they'll all feel the pinch more than I will, my supervisor probably will get pinched too just because she's the highest paid hourly. My manager is super not happy that she'll probably end up doing desk shifts until this all passes.

The first dickbags to come in on my shift walk in with ""I have COVID-19, can I check in?"" (while doing her best to sound sick.) I gave her my best and most obvious fake laugh and just looked at her like she just said something stupid, because well,,, she did. Her mom started going on about how ""This just proves how ignorant Americans have become."" and her daughter is like ""well he really thought I was serious!""

I had to clarify because really bitch? I was like ""No,, I didn't think you were serious, I just didn't think it was at all funny."" She kinda sunk back a bit and got all sulky. 

I got them all squared away and mom plopped down in my lobby where the tv is still on CNN because I have not switched over to my cartoons yet. After a couple minutes I hear her groan and stomp off. I look around and notice my tv is all jacked up. Apparently she couldn't figure out how to change it to (I'm guessing) Fox News so just started pushing random shit. I had to giggle a bit.

"During the graveyard shift there isn’t usually much action unless it’s a weekend. Last night being a Thursday was unusually active, especially considering how much occupancy has dropped due to COVID-19 scares. 

We had a few things happen but the one thing that really irked me was one specific guest who felt his needs transcended those of the other guests. He had called down around 1:45 AM and thus began my long battle with him. 

Me = Me
AG = Annoying Guest

Me: Thank you for calling the front desk, how can I help you?

AG: Connect me to the restaurant. 

Me: I’m so sorry sir, unfortunately our restaurant is closed for the night. 

AG: I saw the lights on, don’t lie to me. 

Me: That may have been the mistake of whoever closed this evening. I will go remedy that. Again, I do apologize. 

At this point, another line is ringing and my deskmate is on her lunch so I tell the man I will have to place him on hold. You can imagine how well he took that. I pick up the other line and it’s a guest calling to say that he had fallen and needed help getting up. I sent one of our security guards and notified the guest I had given them keys to access his room. I clicked over to the first guest but he had hung up. 

My desk mate comes back and I inform her of the injured guest. Security calls us back and says that they couldn’t get inside because the deadbolt was down. We call the guest again and there is no answer. We’re freaking out and my desk mate keeps trying to call him while I check in a guest who had just entered the lobby. The phone rings while my desk mate is trying to get ahold of our injured guest and I can’t answer it while I’m helping the person in front of me. It stops ringing just as I’ve sent the current guest away with her keys. 

My desk mate finally gets ahold of the injured guest and tells him what’s going on. After a long while we figure out that the window in his room is open. Security has to literally pop out the screen and climb in to help the poor guest in to bed. 

While all of this is happening, an irate man walks into the lobby and goes to our gift shop. We have snacks and things there and he’s browsing them. He grabs a microwaveable meal and storms up to the front desk. Guess who it is?

AG: Did I speak to you earlier?

Me: It’s very possible. Is there a problem sir?

AG: Yes. I was told I wasn’t allowed to eat i’m the restaurant. And then no one up here bothered to answer my phone call!

Me: Ah, I’m sorry sir but our restaurant is closed for the night. 

AG: It isn’t. But I’m buying this since I’m not allowed in the restaurant for some reason. They even locked the doors. 

Me: ... I’m so sorry about that. Would you like me to add this meal to your room charges?

AG: No, I’ll pay for it now. 

Me: Perfect. Cash or card?

AG: I said I’ll pay for it now!

Me: [now VERY annoyed] And I said, cash or card?

AG: [rolling his eyes] Cash.

"  

Backstory: The first hotel I worked at on my 3-4 night that I was by myself, aka (Fresh Meat for night audit), the security guard came up to me and saying he went into a room and there was a body there and asked me to come up. Me being young and dumb didn’t think about it, we get upstairs and just as we get to the door and the guard goes “I was kidding about the body I just wanted a witness to this open door.” I was truly ready to smack this guy upside his head at that moment. It turned out housekeeping just didn’t shut the door properly. 

Cast:

Front Office Manager (FM) 

Paramedic (Medic) 

Police Officer (OP) 

Security Guard (SG)

Me (Young Dumb kid who got a quick lesson on what to expect on Night Audit, IE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE)

Story:

About 2 weeks after the story above I saw this woman extremely drunk partying with a husband and wife team. I am working on the night audit reports and the SG calls me out to the hallway next to the elevator. SG Tells me “I was just sitting here the elevator came down opened up there was someone lying across the floor.” I looked at him and said “Nice try you fooled me once!”, then started walking away. SG “NO I am serious there was someone laying on the floor.” My Reply “Yea yea I call Bull.” Start walking away again. SG “Stop please I am telling you I am serious.” With a deadpan look, I tell him “I am not falling for it.” SG “Please let me call down the elevator.” He does and the door opens there is a woman laying on the floor in a fetal position partially dressed. My mouth hit the floor and sadly my first thought was she was attacked. I kept says “Miss are you ok?” I finally realize she is passed out, after trying to check if she was a registered guess. She was not, she was a local, I called 911 and explained the situation. The PO shows up they tried yelling and shaking her but she wouldn’t wake up. The Ambulance arrives and they use smelling salts. For those that are not aware of what this is, they are an Ammonia-based inhaler that is supposed to wake the dead. These don’t even wake her up. They get her into the gurney and are wheeling her out when she finally woke up saying “Hey what are you guys doing to me.” The SG apologized several times saying that his little joke backfired and he learned never to do that joke again on anyone. The next day I call up FM and ask her if she enjoyed the security report from last night. She starts laughing and tells me she has an update “The woman called back to the hotel looking for her shoes.” The FM continues “If that was me I would have said screw the shoes and been too embarrassed to ever show my face in this place again.” I informed her “There is one part that was not in the report. All the medics in the area all knew her information off the top of their heads. They evidently picked her up at least once a week for the same thing for months.”Security Guard pulls prank and regrets doing it 2 weeks later.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey, I tried to post this a couple times a few hours ago and mentioned the specific OTA, my goof, my bad. Sorry mod team. So here's the new attempt.

Update is: nothing exciting happened. It's too bad, I wanted to find out she got led out in handcuffs or something a la sitcom television. That isn't what happened, she didn't show but someone else who was sketchy showed up with a story that seemed very close to hers (checking into his mom's room vs. ""I'm going to have a friend show up first""). His name was NOT on her reservation, but then came through on an OTA res, the auditor forgot to mark it tax exempt, things happened. The dude left because apparently this was all too hard to him. We don't have proof he was connected but it seemed likely.

Side update, on the issue in my comments as to why I couldn't post an update sooner: I am trucking on. No one was hurt, just some vehicles. We'll see how things go on that front. Stay safe out there guys.Update: You would not believe the levels of OOF we're on right now",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My daughter and I were scheduled to travel to a large (US) city soon and due to closures and postponements of events I have had to reschedule our trip.  I wasn't able to get through to the hotel on the phone so I emailed their reservations department.  

At first they said my room reservation was non cancellable and non refundable.  I asked if they would be able to move my reservation in light of recent events and I was willing to pay a fee.  They came back and agreed to move the reservation.  I have to pay less than $50 extra due to a rate change but I didn't have to lose my money for the original reservation.  

I definitely thanked them for their kindness and let them know that I am sure they are very busy right now but I definitely appreciated their help.  I received a nice message back from them.  I'm thankful for such nice service and them working with me in spite of all this current craziness.

EDIT: I booked directly with the hotel and it doesn't seem to be associated with any of the chain hotels.  It's a bit pricey in an expensive city.  I had gotten a great black Friday deal that was non refundable.Great hotel service is appreciated",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Everyone is panicking because the words “cutting hours” were used.

My GM is usually such an easy person to talk to, right now you can’t get 2 words out of them. They are stressed and frankly scared the hotel won’t survive this. 

I’ve had to disinfect my entire lobby because someone checked in and used the words “self-quarantine!”

My restaurant hasn’t seen a single sale today. 

How is everyone else holding up during this? I know we can’t be the only hotel really struggling.

"I'm finding this whole not touching your face thing very trying as I am constantly smacking my hands on my face in exacerbation. I just got a phone call from from a lady asking about her upcoming reservation. She was asking to apply an AAA discount to her third party virtual card reservation. So right now I'm mad, not at her, but at whatever machination is happening that causes people to think they're booking directly through us instead of third parties. I explain that we can't apply any more discounts and she's fine with that. She then asks if we had any Coronavirus cases at our property. I'm thinking... We haven't had anyone die of Coronavirus on our property if that's what she means, and it's not like we're administering tests or vetting people as part of the check in process, whatever, I don't have time to explain my understanding of the nuances of the Coronavirus situation, I just tell her no. Then she asks if we're offering a Coronavirus discount. I say ""heh, nothing like that right now"" with an amused inflection thinking she was joking. But the way she said ""... Okay, thanks."" and hung up told me she wasn't joking.Are you offering any Coronavirus discounts?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"SoThen dude comes down. ""I just made a reservation, last name Durr..""

The first name is rather androgynous so I don't think anything of it until he hands me his ID with 1 name, and a credit card under the reservation name. 

I explain that I need either a credit card in his name, or the person named on the cc and reservation to come check in. He looks at me confused and tells me that there is a reservation. 

Um, yes, yes there is.

Then he comes back with an ID and a credit card. Now neither of those are his. I could not hide it on my face and was like ""Look,, when I said I needed the card holder to check in, I didn't mean you with their info. I can't possibly check you in using someone elses id and credit card."" He states again that there is a reservation which still agree,, yeah. there is.  He gets on his phone and then a huffy lady appears off my elevator. (yaaay, they're already in one room, and before I get asked no, the last names on their ID's were not the same.)

She huffs up to the desk and I do my thing. ""Alright, I have you for 1 night in this kinda room blah blah blah.)

I send them on their way and a couple minutes later they're back again.

""This room only has one bed!"" 

""Yes ma'am, It's a single queen. That was the reservation sent to us by B.C.""

She looks at me with that look and whips out her phone to prove me a liar, then says possibly the stupidest thing I've heard in a while. ""It says queen bed! That means there's two of them!""

Yeah,, my face immediately went WTF?

I did my best to explain that well no... queen bed means queen bed, rooms with 2 beds would be listed as just that.

I'm over them already and she's complaining about having to keep coming down, she's injured (non visible) and her husband only has one leg. (didn't notice. I can't see legs when you're at the desk.)

I begrudgingly move them rooms to get them out of my face. 

Then a couple minutes go by and their kids (who are in the other room I guess.) come off the elevator complaining that the keys don't work. While I'm reading the keys they're also going on about how mom is injured and is pissed that she has to keep coming down, one legged dad, the works.' I'm feigning interest and empathy and tell them the keys are indeed good, I ask if they noticed any lights on the lock that might give me a hint as to what the problem is and all that. 

The light question super stumped them so I grab my cordless and the lock programmer and we all head back up. Mom is sitting in the hallway brewing and mumbling so I do my best ""Hmm,, let's see what's going on here."" kind voice. I slide the key and wouldn't ya know it, the door opens right up.

Then they both say the 2nd stupidest thing I've heard today.. ""Ooooh, room XXX!""

Yeah, despite it being written on the key envelope as big and clear as it is,  they were trying the wrong fucking door...

"I have had ten people cancel today and a new policy has rolled out stating we cannot charge a fee if they cancel too late, our policy is 24 hours before check in, now we HAVE to cancel without fee. Ok cool, I don't mind, HOWEVER, the questions that are coming from these phone calls make me want to walk out right now.

This woman called me and asked what my policy was on denying people entry into my hotel. I asked what she meant by this, she said, ""like what if you didn't want them to stay or they weren't allowed to, how does that work?""

I told her that has different conditions, I told her if they trashed the room, done drugs, became violent, or are wanted by the police, even treat the staff poorly, mainly if they are on our do not stay list, they are denied that are some of our conditions.

She said heard nothing about denying sick people

Why would I deny sick people?

She started yelling about what if they had the coronavirus, and that I just want to get the entire hotel sick because I am a sick person....................................................I then asked what if they had allergies, because it is now allergy season.

She said she didn't care and continued yelling.

I told her I won't be denying anybody entry into my hotel if they have done nothing wrong, because that isn't right? I will be cleaning and sanitizing everything though after that individual leaves my lobby to be safe, but I will not deny, because what if they just have a simple cold? Or they have really bad allergies? I am somebody who has really bad allergies right now, I can't wear my eye make up because my eyes have been so watery that it just comes off. Also, my cat slept on my face last night, and I am very allergic to cats.

Also, this dude today got super rude and aggressive with me because I wouldn't refund him, and he yelled ""I am going to report your ass""

I told him to do it and I will happily provide the needed phone numbers to report me.

Me: ""Well I see that your rate is 139 plus tax per night.""

Guest: ""Well yeah that is way to high. I thought since of the Coronavirus your rates would be a lot lower""

Two hours before I came in, the announcement came that Spring Training and the NHL season has been suspended, so just like everyone else, we are being barraged with cancellations.

I have heard so many lies, it isn't funny.  I have been told that we have to cancel third party reservations because the airlines have said so.

So I'm a full time night auditor at a medium sized property (140 rooms) in a small but very populated university city. Tonight is my last night at this property, and next week I start as NA at a newer property in town.

We're all fighting the same cancellation battle here so I know I don't need to go into detail about the absurd numbers we're getting. When I got to work tonight I was given a stack of papers containing all of the cancellations over the last few days. It's about 16 pages worth, with 15-20 per page. My time consuming task for tonight is to compile all of these cancelled reservations into an excel spreadsheet for my GM. Luckily we're at 20% tonight so I'll have plenty of time to take care of it, but it just drives home the reasons I decided to move to a new property.

Since we can’t cover the salary of the staff we decided to let people go. From 200 employees we need to narrow it down to 30 staff. Some will be let go with proper compensation and some will be sent home for three months until everything goes back to normal.

It’s 4:00 am and I’m still deciding on who shall keep and let go knowing that I have an amazing team.

"I didn’t think I’d post twice in one day, but here I am. 

I had two people walk in tonight asking about the hotel. The older woman she was wanting to stay a couple months while her apartment building is renovated. Being starved for guests I’d do anything to get long term business like that. 

They asked to see several different rooms available. I showed them a couple rooms on the third floor. They wore rubber gloves the entire time and were asking questions about mold. My hotel is 6 months old and We’ve never had a problem with mold. Room to room they commented on the smell of each room. How one smelled of heavy product and the others didn’t. Or one room they went in they said it smelled like construction equipment. 

They decided on a room they liked and I checked them in for one night, as they were going to see if they could sleep tonight. They asked if they were going to extend their stay that they didn’t want housekeeping to clean the room, that they would clean it. 

They proceeded to ask me about their folio number... and I can’t make this shit up... to make sure there weren’t any 9s and 4s right next to each other. I told them their folio is the same as their confirmation number. They were both pleased by this because there were no 9s and 4s next to each other; citing that their religion sees it as evil. 

Then they asked for spare sheets. They weren’t going to use the sheets on the beds. They weren’t even going to use the beds and are going to sleep on the floor. 

I am so confused at all of this.

Update: 

They only stayed a few hours. 
They had “discovered” black mold in the room. 
My night auditor had checked but hadn’t seen anything. He offered to move them to another room on the fourth floor. 

They said they wanted to see the room without the presence of my night auditor because he wears cologne. My night auditor checked the room while they waited in the hall. He could hear them on the phone with our loyalty support, telling them that the hotel has black mold. 

They decided my hotel was not the place for them.

"I've been a night auditor for close to a year now and the reoccurring thorn in my side has been my 2AM calls from a man who wants to pretend to make a reservation while touching himself. These calls first started, for me, back in October of last year and really bothered me at first. My GM and AGM were behind me hanging up on him and filing a police report and that seemed to work for awhile. Until December. Then now again this month. And he'll call for a week or two and then you don't hear from him for a few more weeks. I've done research into his pattern and he makes a round of the hotels in central Illinois and he uses the same information every single time. Also, the police in my area have told management that they can't do anything without the phone records which they are not getting. So what can you do right? 

A couple nights ago he calls me and by this point I know his voice but I want to be sure so I give him a minute to give me his fake name. He does as usual and then he tries to get sexual with me. 

Me: I'll play your game all the way through and won't hang up on you if you answer one question for me. 

Him: Okay

Me: Why hotels?

Him: They are open all the time and usually staffed by women. 

Me: So you think harassing underpaid workers for your enjoyment is okay?

Him: Yeah, who does it hurt?

And this point I have on a devil may care grin that feels like it's going to split my face in two. And I say with glee, ""Hey guess what? I lied."" And I slam down the phone!

He calls back 30 seconds later and he's in shock that I lied to him! He tells me I'm rude and I give a hearty ""Yep!"" and hang that phone up again! 30 seconds later he's calling me a b*tch for lying and I'm dying as I hang up again. 

Last call, I pick up and he calls me a c*nt. I tell him he can call all night, every night if he wants since he obliviously has a masochistic streak a mile wide and I slammed down the phone again.

"400+ room hotel and convention center in a small city. We’re hosting a industry wine expo this week. 

Last night I was checking in a guest who was one of the event speakers. He looked like he was feeling miserable, possibly feverish. I didn’t think anything too much until he handed me an ID from Italy. I guess he was already out of the country before they quarantined. Yes, I went over to the hand sanitizer and quickly scrubbed at least 3-4 pumps into my hands.

Today another guest came to the front desk and was telling me about this one speaker from Italy they had been listening to that couldn’t stop coughing while he was speaking. They said he seemed really sick. They were saying how glad they were that they were sitting far away from him. 

I asked what he looked like, and from their description am pretty sure he was my guest from the night before. 

We are in a US state that has about a dozen confirmed cases, but none in our county yet.

"So a little story since I am in quarantine.  Long story short I travel for work and live in Seattle and have been exposed.  Our office went completely online and no travel allowed which will mean since I started this career I will have a whole month without having to leave home for work.  I got some gardening done, played with my dog, painted my home office.  Caught up on TV.  

I'm old, so know two things in advance.  Caller ID was really new.  Caller ID was this extra box you had to buy and the screen was very small and hard to read in most cases.  The internet existed as dial up, but it wasn't something everyone had, cell phones were few and far between.  

It's roughly 8pm and I am just chilling, pre internet so most likely reading a book, and I get a call.  I answer with my normal spiel.  To say this man was frantic is an understatement.  It sounded like he had just been running, breath ragged, tone of voice sheer terror.   ""WHAT IS GOING!?!  ON WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!""

You know when you are expecting an outcome but something totally different happens and your brain sort of just seizes up and stops?  Yeah, that was me.  So it took a few clicks longer than needed to get my mouth to make any words, let alone my brain think of any.  ""WHY ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING ME?!?  ITS MY WIFE!!  MY WIFE ISN'T IT!!!?""

At this point my brain is like OK say something, ""Wha...""

""WHAT IS HAPPENING DAMN IT!!!""

""I don't...um, I don't understand.""

""IS MY WIFE HURT?""

""Um, what, sir, I am, I don't understand what is happening here, um I don't know your wife.""

""IT SAYS ""Brand Name Hotel Here"" HOSPITAL \*SOBS\* HOSPITAL!  OH GOD MY WIFE""  Now keep in mind I still  don't really understand what he is saying.  It hasn't click for me like maybe it has for you.  

""Hospital?  No sir this is the, ""says name of hotel with city and state here'""

He slowly repeats the hotel's name.

""Yes sir.  Um, if your wife is a guest here I can assure you I haven't had any incidents tonight, I mean she might be out maybe?  Um, I'm sorry sir I am at a loss of what info I can get for you.""

""But my caller ID says ""hotel brand name here"" hospital!""  At this point it clicks.  The technology was still so new I had never really seen a caller ID box but maybe once and that what he is seeing is hospitality, but since the screen is only so many alphas long he is seeing ""hospital"".

""Sir your caller ID box is cutting off the whole word hospitality to hospital.  Is your wife maybe a guest here?""  Well, I confirm she is and ring him to her room.  I was sort of just stunned, and perplexed, slightly amused, and relieved all at once.  This was before I was a soulless customer service bot so I sort of laughed it off and promptly recovered.   Until 10 minutes later the phone rings again, I answer with the standard greeting, ""YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE COMPANY NAME!!!""

""Change our name?""

""YES ITS UNACCEPTABLE FOR IT TO SAY HOSPITAL!""

""It doesn't, it says hospitality and the ""Chain Brand Name"" was clearly listed.""  Side note, our brand name is VERY well known and no hospitals are called by it, although I bet some wish they were with us versus the hospital.  

""NO!!  CHANGE YOUR NAME!""

""I am sorry that would be up to corporate and considering they have been known by this name for almost 75 years I doubt that will change, can I make a suggestion sir?  Get a bigger caller ID box.""

That was the only time that had happened as the tech moved so fast that the new boxes scrolled.  I chock it up to a very concerned husband (probably should have known his wife was staying at the hotel clearly labeled) with zero clue about his new toy, and while he should have been relived and accepting of the issue, he made further embarrassment by demanding a well know chain of hotels change their names because he's a dolt.Working From Home",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Currently because of how things are going with the Coronavirus we have very little capital rolling in and spending costs have been majorly cut. 

Which means I can’t even pay Pepsi for my order to restock my market. Most guests are understanding when we are low on items but one guest was belligerent because we didn’t have Diet Pepsi.

Guest comes down to lobby. I’m at the front desk explaining budget cuts to one of my agents.

G: there’s no Diet Pepsi. 

Me: Yes, I know how frustrating it is when im at a hotel and it doesn’t have my favorite beverage. I am so sorry about that. I have an order coming in soon (I lied because Pepsi is halting my shipment until we have money to pay invoices). 

G: Well. That doesn’t help me today. 

Me: there’s a gas station right up the road that carries Pepsi products, and it might save you some money than buying here. 

G: I don’t have time for that. I just need something quick. 

Guest leaves in a huff as if I had shot down her hopes and dreams. 

Day two: 

I’m in bright and early and the same guest comes down to the lobby. I’m attentive and realize who she is right away. 

Me: Good morning. 

G: *looks at market* STILL no Diet Pepsi!? 

Me: Unfortunately not. 

G: When is the order supposed to be in?

Me: A few days, they haven’t given me a time frame yet. 

G: That’s not my problem. 

Me: I realize this and just as soon as I have some in, I’ll send two to your room complimentary (going to have one of the goons watch the desk as I go out to get a six pack of Diet Pepsi to put in her room as what we call “smile makers”. Mainly just to appease her so that I don’t have to deal with it again). 

G: that’s not good enough for me. 

Me: Ok. What can I do for you? 

G: *visibly frustrated* nothing.

I went out to get some Diet Pepsi so the guest would stop bothering me. I had housekeeping place it in her room. 

Day three: 

I’m working the mid, having a meeting with my staff about Coronavirus updates. The guest comes down into the lobby. 

I stop my meeting to speak with her. She’s still looking like someone pissed in her coffee. 

Me: Hi, how can I help you? 

G: there was a six pack of Diet Pepsi in my room.  And there’s still no Diet Pepsi in the market.

G: Yeah, I appreciate the effort but I’m an adult and don’t need handouts.

We had a reservation for Seymour Butts - I kid you not.  I saw it on the Arrivals list and rolled my eyes, thinking someone was just trying to be a wise ass, and ignored it.

Two hours into my shift, a couple come in and state they have a reservation under ""Jones, Michael"".

Well, it was a PRE-PAID third party reservation and as we all know, we can't make any changes to those without the consent of the OTA.  I tell him to contact the OTA and have them add his REAL name to the reservation or he won't be able to check in.

He goes ballistic!  While he is on the phone with the OTA he's screaming at me about how no one can take a joke, and he's paid for this room, I better check him in, etc etc.  He tells the lady that answered that I am refusing to check him in because the reservation name doesn't ""exactly"" match his ID and they better call and ""straighten"" me out.

The OTA calls and she cops a serious attitude with me about it until I stop her mid sentence and tell her he used a fake name to make the reservation.  She goes quiet and says ""He told me that the name was just spelled wrong.""   I informed her of the name he used and his real name and she apologizes for how she started the call and politely requests that I add his real name to the reservation, which I do.

He was the most difficult customer I’ve had in a while. I wasn’t surprised when he gave me his passport, “Republique Française”

\- Can´t you just do it this time, he's here eating.

\+ (The waiter and I are good friends) Look dude, it doesn't cost me anything to check him in. But I don't  know who this is. If I check him in and this dude does a runner. The shit storm that will follow will be for me. So tell him to come up to reception, check in and then he can charge away to his room.

\- Okay, cool. I\`ll tell him.

"I work in a city with skyrocketing coronavirus numbers. A hotel nearby was connected to multiple patients and the outlook doesn't seem good. Anxious residents abound. It's non-stop worrying from them. 

If I'm too calm about it, they'll freak out that we aren't taking it seriously enough. If I'm too panicked, well that obviously breeds panic. Luckily there are no cases in my building yet (especially because they are mostly over 70 here). Still, the writing is on the wall. 

Most businesses in my area are promoting work from home options but as we all know, that's not an option for our profession. Luckily, my manager called me today told me that the company will be paying us in the event we end up quarantined. I know many in our line of work may not have such solid support. Stay strong folks.

Anyway, even though we have cleaning staff, I have started protocols among concierge/FD staff: 

-Clorox wiping elevator buttons and door handles in the lobby every couple hours during shifts (when the cleaning staff aren't here, ours are amazing and keep it spotless).

-Washing hands at the beginning, middle and end of your shift. My people haven't worked in food service before so I don't think they are used to thinking about it being a part of your job yet.

-Clorox wiping the desk at the beginning, middle and end of your shift.

-I've provided a secret bottle of hand sanitizer just for the FD staff that guests won't blow through.

"-This originally was a comment to another users post about a lady who got upset with her that there were no festivals going on in the city the weekend she visited.-

Years ago I was the Concierge at a DT hotel in a Northern Canadian city. Frequently we’d get US guests who had been promised some pretty amazing things from their travel planners. This one guy came to my desk to store his luggage as his flight wasn’t until later that day. Having a few hours to kill he asked me the easiest way to get to the Arctic Circle as he wanted to see it before he went back home to New York.

I laughed at first thinking he was kidding, then upon realizing he was serious told him we were about 2000 miles from the Arctic Circle. He was pretty bummed out, he said his Travel Agent had told him it was just outside our city. He also thought it was a place and while that was back in the days before the internet and Google Maps, I did have a big book of maps which included a globe view so I was able to show him what the Arctic Circle actually was and that is was at 45 degrees North and our city was at 54 degrees.

He was kind of short with me, I guess because I rained on his parade, then he said, OK, OK, I will just go look at Jasper then. Can you call me a cab? I asked him if really wanted to take a cab as it was over 200 miles miles away. Also Jasper National Park is not something you look ‘at’, it is a National Park about 4200 square miles with numerous attractions.

This really pissed him off, he told me his travel agent said ‘Jasper Falls’ was right downtown. Pulled out the map book again for another geography lesson. He threw up his hands in frustration and said “what the hell am I supposed to do until my flight? I told everyone at home I was going to the Arctic Circle!”

At the time we had the world’s largest shopping mall, it was only a 30 minute cab ride from the hotel, I offered that. He said he’d think about it. He was pretty choked about the lies his TA told him, but somehow mad at me. Looking at his folio I saw he was in the hotel attending an Ophthalmology conference. How could someone, obviously that well educated, be so ignorant of world geography?

He eventually just sat in the lobby all day, and he seemed to be glaring at me whenever I glanced in his direction!I told all my friends I was going to the Arctic Circle",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I posted this elsewhere but was recommended this sub. I edited it a little bit to make it read less awkwardly.

When I was 25, I worked in the midwest United States for a very well-known hotel chain. This chain has hotels all over the world, ranging from shitty interstate motels to much nicer resort hotels, it's almost certainly the first one that comes to mind for most people. It was a university town, and this was a pretty nice hotel, as far as midwestern hotels go- 5 floors, a large lobby, conference room, ballrooms, and a restaurant attached, which offered room service. I think the rating was 3 stars.

I worked in the maintenance department, usually evenings. Mostly my responsibilities were service calls when folks checked in and found the batteries to the TV remote dead- things like that, as well as set-up and takedown for receptions and meetings in the conference center and ballrooms.

The manager (Jane) and owner (Dick) of this hotel were pretty terrible bosses in general, there was also a lot of the typical management bullshit- incompetence/stupidity, passive-aggression, cringey corporate jargon, etc., but this story is by far the worst thing I experienced at that job.

One afternoon I showed up to work and everyone was in a weird mood, there was a lot of tension. A man had committed suicide in one of the rooms- the police had to break down the door because the guy working the day shift didn't know how to use the tool which overrode the electronic door locks. The coroner had already come and taken the body away when I arrived for work.

Owner/management handled things in a really sleazy way. I was told that the owner (Dick) tried to get the coroner's staff to take the body down the side staircase, not use the elevator, because he didn't want any guests to see and talk about what had happened. I understand it's potentially bad press, but that's beyond awful. Apparently the coroner told said, ""Do you want to let us use the elevator, or do you want us to leave the body here?"" I'm glad he put Dick in his place.

All this was done by the time I got to work, but there was still a lot to clean up in the room. The guy had overdosed on pills, but I'm sure everyone reading this knows things leak out when you die. He left a note saying he'd made some bad decisions in his life and anyone handling his body should wear gloves. The hotel manager (Jane) instructed the housekeeping staff to clean up the mess- throw the sheets and mattress out. I was instructed to take carpet cleaner to the room and clean up any spots around the bed, of which there were many. I wasn't taking any chances- I put two rubber gloves on each hand and a trash bag over each arm. In retrospect I can't believe I just blindly followed those instructions for just a hair above minimum wage.

Before the day shift was allowed to leave that day Jane gathered all of us in the back office. I thought we were going to have some kind of talk about what had happened, like formally address what had happened and make sure everyone was okay. Instead she instructed us not to tell anyone what had happened. That's it.

I later learned that the way this was handled was actually illegal in this state. Having minimum-wage staff, with no training or appropriate equipment, clean up death? Looking back I can't believe I did it. I also learned that, while not required, it is standard to offer staff some kind of counseling option after dealing with something like that at work.

Don't agree to do something at work that seems like it's beyond the job you were hired to do. Don't willingly put yourself in danger at work. There are professionals who specialize in things like this.

"I do not have the glorious privilege of working the front desk however this story made me think of all of you. 

Family was in town staying at a hotel. We went and visited them there. It was a hockey tournament so the lobby was full of parents with pizza and beer (no idea where the kids were).  The FD guy let my family and I in a conference room to play cards and said he’d tell us 30 minutes before we had to leave so we could clean up. Awesome guy. 

While talking about how awesome he was my cousin told me this gem. 

She was traveling with her daughters soccer team. Girls had a game at 7am the next morning so they were trying to sleep. Random people in the lobby drinking and being loud. My cousin asked the front desk to ask them to lower the volume. (It was midnight). He said no problem. 90 minutes later still loud AF. They couldn’t change rooms because hotel was full. She asks again the guy said no problem he’ll try to tell them to lower the volume. Fifteen minutes later she has to go out again because they got even louder. He promised to get them to stop and to not wake the girls she went to the lobby bathroom to pee. She opens the door and two couples are in the bathroom banging away. One couple on the sink and the other against the wall, pants around the ankles. She stops in shock then goes “are you *kidding* me?!” And storms to the front desk. 

Guy sees her coming. She goes “it’s not enough there are people drunk and loud in the lobby but now there are two couples having sex In your bathroom!” He sighs and says “I am trying to get them to be quiet....*pause* what? Having sex?!” She said yeah in your lobby bathroom. He quickly leaves and then comes back with two couples behind him. The couples head for the elevator, the FD guy apologizes. 

My friend got her hotel room credited for the couples banging in the bathroom. She did run into them when she was leaving the hotel and the two women blushed, the one guy didn’t make eye contact but the second guy just went “heeey”. 

She said it’s been burned in her memory for life.“There are four people having sex in your bathroom!” “I’m sorry that...excuse me what?!”",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My first story from this hotel! This is a really chill place to work and I love it. It's an extended stay place and kind of upscale for the area, and we have a lot of really cool guests. Been here a year and can't think of any bad stories to tell! The place before this, uff da, I got to deal with drunks 2 to 3 times a night. Hur-ray.

Tonight, though, as I was delivering the bills under the door, on the fourth floor I saw someone passed out in the hallway. I blinked and went down, and sure enough, it's one of our regulars, though he has a room on the second floor. There he was, ass all hanging out, face down in the carpet, car keys skewed near his hand and no room keys to be found. ""Did he try to unlock the wrong door with his car keys?"" I wonder.

Regardless, I try to wake him up. He mumbles but doesn't move. Try again. Nothing. He's face down, so I can't put the knuckle to the sternum (that wakes people up REALLY fast) and I sigh. I finish the floor then go down and check which room he's in. Ok, second, not fourth. He's here with a work crew so I look them up as I couldn't wake him. No answer in their rooms. Well, poop. I figure I'll try it one more time, and this time he woke up. Poured him back in his room.

His boss comes down in the morning and asks to ring Mr. Drunk's room. I pull him aside and tell him what happened. ""Oh my god,"" he says, over and over again. Over and over. We try calling the room. I give him the room number (normally I wouldn't but I know for a FACT they're together) so he can try knocking. HE calls from his room. We call again from the desk. Mr. Drunk is completely passed out.

As annoying as it was for me, I bet it'll be even more annoying for Mr. Drunk when he gets reprimanded and has a bad hangover.

"I have worked for hotels for a few years now: one hotel would have an average of 4-15 check-ins per day during a normal week while the second hotel has 10-30. I know a lot of people would scoff at 30 rooms as there are hotels with over a hundred rooms (my last being 75) but it can get hectic easily with 40.

Especially when an event is scheduled for several highschool teams playing at a local college and have to cancel and then (possibly) rebook.

I came in for the afternoon shift(3pm) and was prepared for a normal day. Nothing huge happening, about 15-20 arrivals and thats fine. However with severe weather on the way the Board of this event made a unanimous decision to cancel within less than 24 hour notice of the event's starting time and about 20 hours left until check-in. Thankfully, the Head of the Board let me know ahead of time. So I immediately (as soon as I could) called my manager to get her over to help.

Moms are mad, not really at us but the board of the event, but some are FURIOUS because we couldn't refund them on non-cancellable, non-refundable rooms. When you book, the sites explicitly TELL YOU that it is this sort of reservation. We can't (won't) do anything about it because it clearly says it in the booking's description.

After approximately 3 hours of having 3 lines always open amd ringing, putting guests on hold, getting their phone number, handling the next call, getting their phone number, then handling them in order of when they called, we had almost all these guests cancelled, rooms rebooked, and (new?) Sports Mom guests booking rooms causing the Cancelling Moms to be pissed that their are no more rooms left.

"This is going to be a long-ish ranty kind of thing so I apologise in advance. This lady stayed with us 2 nights, checking in on Friday and checking out Sunday. Even thinking back I just groan, and am kind of glad she called us the worst hotel she’s ever stayed in because it means she will not come back and I won’t have to see her again.

I started when she rang around mid-day asking if her rate included dinner and breakfast. She booked through Fecking.com - we don’t offer dinner bed and breakfast here it’s exclusive to our own website. I politely explained it doesn’t so she could choose whether she wanted to have dinner with us in the evening and add breakfast to her room as she goes. Conversation finished friendly enough and she hung up. 

They come to the hotel, and that’s when things start to go awry. The first thing they say to me being along the lines of ‘just to say, there’s no benefit to booking your hotel in advance is there?’ and this is immediately throws me off my flow. They then argued that because they booked in advance the breakfast wasn’t included because they ‘definitely clicked on the rate that included dinner bed and breakfast’... sure hon. It took a lot of effort not to just ask if she was sure that was this hotel because we 100% *do not offer this rate on Fecking.com* at all. She then asks my name, so I give her my first name. I don’t even give my full name to OTAs i’m definitely not comfortable giving her my surname - even if she says it’s just for ‘observation’. Sure hon... They then ask me can I just give them the price that they saw online for the room, which was heavily discounted because what hotel doesn’t discount the rooms they have available on the day in order to try and sell their rooms? I said yes, but they would still be charged the amount for their original booking. 

Continuing on with the check-in, they’d asked for a ground floor room. This was allocated, but this is a room with an older-style shower in it and a bath that looks as though it has a jacuzzi but it has been disconnected. The hotel was close to flooding recently, with the hotel’s basement actually flooding, so these have been disconnected as a safety measure and preparation for the renovations coming in the new year. Part of our check-in procedures is to advise how to use the showers properly and to advise that these jacuzzis do not function. As I’m halfway through explaining how to use the showers she immediately interrupts me (triggering my pet peeve grrr) with ‘so are you saying these showers are faulty?’

Sigh. Deep breath. 

Willyouletmefinishsoicanactuallytellyou?

I don’t think I’ve ever had my intelligence insulted on such a subtle level before in my life by the way she is questioning me. Do you honestly think we would sell a room with a broken shower? 

I, politely as ever in order just to keep my cool, finish the check-in and they leave. That’s the last of my degradation until I see them on their check-out. They, of course, list everything that was wrong with their stay. Things broken in their room, which I told them about in the first place. They brought up, again, the broken record of them paying too much for that room - she even said she was disappointed that I didn’t offer them a discount for the room or a comp breakfast before they’d even checked in. They did get a comp breakfast from me, but that was only because they’d complained about the breakfast that they’d had the previous day and *they had managed to pull the shower door with so much force that the shower door came off the goddamn rails* - another complaint they gave me.

Now with our complaints procedure there are certain questions we have to ask in order to clarify what had happened. I asked how they opened the door to try and figure it out. She turns around to me and says ‘well I think my husband is mature enough to know how to open a shower door’... considering it was opening perfectly fine before and after you left... Sure hon... 

They left. They reviewed the hotel. I responded rather fairly. I hit my head against the desk a few times. I have honestly never felt more inadequate at my job in my life than with these guests. I can safely say that the guest I spoke to after found her just as insufferable as I did...

"So this is more funny than rude. I come into work yesterday and I’m informed because of daylight savings all the looks to guest rooms haven’t been working with the key cards. Maintenance has been going around reprogramming them but hasn’t gotten to all of them and sometimes the guest just needs to give it a minute and the key card will work. 

Shortly after I come in maintenance leaves for the day and hasn’t gotten to all the rooms. About three times I had to leave the front desk to reprogram the lock myself otherwise the guest just needed to give it a minute. Annoying, but not a major problem since amazingly I had no rude guest.

The odd/funny moment happens when an older couple comes saying they still can’t get into the room and maintenance had said they would work on it or give them a new key. (Which he never did) I ask them to give me a moment and I will be up to reprogram the door myself. Older gentleman says he knows there’s a master key because that’s how he was let into his room earlier and if he could just have that one. 

Ummm no sir you cannot. He proceeds to say he is very trustworthy and just wants to go to his room.

"I mentioned this scam over in some comments, thought I'd break it out into it's own Tale. I also posted over on r/Scams

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of a scam. An attempt at credit card fraud that was quite subtle in its execution.

So there I am, a few months ago, poddling about after audit. A couple come in. They haven't got a reservation, but they're tired and they've been driving all night. No problem, we have availability, can I get a card please?

Oops, problem; the card is declining.

Do they have another form of payment? A debit card will be fine, as long as it- nope, that's declining too.

The gentleman swears up and down that there's enough money on the card, and they're tired and can't drive anymore and mom is in the hospital.

While he calls his bank to straighten things out, I'm getting an odd vibe from the pair. Not quite 'sketchy', but something about them isn't sitting right. They're being just a smidge too... something... and repeating they've been driving all night and mom's in the hospital and they just can't go any further... Wait a minute - isn't the address on their driver's license only twenty miles from here? Yeah, something is up.

After a bit, he hands me the phone. It's the bank. They explain that while the gentleman has enough money in his account, he has exceeded his maximum amount of withdrawals for the day. However, the bank is willing to provide a one-time authorization code for the charge.

**This is a scam.**

What they are doing is relying on the manual/voice authorization process for credit card readers. Basically, it is a backup system, where if your card machine will not communicate with the issuing bank or card company, you can call in to confirm sufficient available credit. The issuing company will give you a manual code to reference the exchange, and you can punch that in to your card reader.

The trick is, you can give the card reader literally any code and it will still work. After all, it's just a reference number, not an actual authorization code.

So the scammers just call someone who can sound like a bank employee, using an 'office background noise generator', give a random number, and the card will appear to work fine. It isn't until the credit card batch is run the next night (after they've checked out) that the discrepancy will be shown. Someone unfamiliar with the process wouldn't even know they'd been had - ""Oh, cool, I didn't know it could do that!"" Add a sympathetic story, so someone is inclined to try and help them.

I realize this is likely what's happening, so decide to test it:

""So to confirm, this is for the card ending in *1234*?""

""Yes sir, that is correct, the card ending in 1234.""

*Gotcha*. The first card was the one ending in 1234. The debit card being called about ends in 5678. No bank employee would make that mistake.

""Ah, unfortunately the system is asking for a manager's override code. I cannot proceed with a manual authorization without that."" (Spoilers: it isn't.)

""Please hand the phone back to Mister Smith.""

There is some discussion, a final last entreaty because they're tired and mom is in the hospital and they can't drive any more (reminder that they're locals), but I tell them that manual authorizations can only be done by the manager. He'll be in tomorrow at 10 am.

Defeated, the scammers shuffle off into the night. Maybe they just wanted a free room. Maybe they were planning on using it for drugs or prostitution. Whatever the reason, they're not going to be doing here.

"Another post reminded me of this story from a while ago.

I work in Rapid City, which has a big Native American population. Fairly often a guest might be unhappy with me (who is white as rice) and they happen to be NA, I get called a racist. It's annoying, but happens often enough that I smile and explain whatever rules again and just let it slide. This time... oh, this time though....

A white dude dressed like a trucker (jeans, ballcap, jean jacket and t-shirt) comes up and asks me something (I don't remember what) and I answer his question, smiling politely. He's obviously intoxicated (we had a bar on the premises) and continues to linger around while I, the poor night audit, am trying to do my work but still be attentive to the guest. He starts hitting on me then, and I'm like, ""That's flattering but I'm married."" Trying to be polite. That's when he whips out the, ""YOU'RE RACIST!"" thing.

I blink at him. ""What?"" Keep in mind, he's a whitey too.

""You're racist against me!"" 

Me: ""Uh, no sir, I'm married. I think you should go back to your room now. The lobby's closed."" (at least to him it was as this was making me really uncomfortable)

""ALL OF YOU SOUTH DAKOTANS ARE RACIST AGAINST ME! I'M JUST A POOR WHITE BOY FROM CHICAGO!""

I'm literally staring at him like, What the fuck? Is he crazy? My brain just would not compute those words. On top of it, he's yelling at the top of his lungs in our very large lobby with a high ceiling, so it's echoing everywhere.

Me: ""Sir, you need to stop yelling and go back to your room immediately or I'm going to have to call security.""

""YOU RACIST BITCH, I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS ON YOU! YOU JUST HATE CHICAGOANS!""

Me: \*calls security\*

Security happened to be close by and had heard the yelling so they were coming to investigate. They try to get this guy into his room peacefully, but no, they're ""racist"" against Chicagoans too, and he takes a swing at them. Yeah, that's it, he goes in handcuffs and they call the cops.

Dude settles down while we all wait for the cops, but once they arrive and they start to talk to the guy, he immediately goes off on a rant about how South Dakotans are evil, we're all racist people against Chicago, and that the po-po (his word, I swear) are just trying to bring ""an honest poor white Chicagoan down"". Almost the entire time I was standing there just staring at him because this made NO sense.

As we are not the greatest hotel in the world our prices are relatively cheap, especially during the week. I gave a quote to a guest yesterday asking for 3 single rooms for next week. I gave them a designated rate from our site minus about £12 just because there would only be one person in the room. Upon hearing the price for the rooms the guest declined saying that unfortunately our prices were out of budget...

Me: "" It looks like you booked for the conference, but you did not make your reservation for the hotel. Unfortunately we are completely sold out for the week.""

Guest: \*\*glares at me like this is all my fault\*\* ""Where am I supposed to sleep, the lobby couch? Why wasn't this reservation made for me like everyone else?!?!""

Me: ""There was a group block set up for the conference, but everyone else here called in to make their reservations. I'm happy to call some other hotels in the area to see if there is any availability.""

We do a ""call around"" 2x a day to know the rates and occupancy of other hotels in the area. So I knew that every hotel in the area was sold out and only one had a suite left available that would cost him $1000 a night. I knew this guy was pissed off and rude so I decided to mess with him a little bit just because I could.

Me: ""Do you have a budget in mind?""

Guest: ""A BUDGET?! I'm traveling with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Wealth Management, you think I have a BUDGET?!""

Great.

Me: ""So I found a suite for you at another hotel right down the road from us. It is going at $1000 a night, and it is the only room left available for the week in town. I gave them your name and number you should expect a call from them shortly.""

This was my petty revenge for this guy and it worked out great. He was PISSED. I've never seen someone get more red and yell louder in my lobby but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I love when people are huge douches and I can get under their skin like this. Oh the joys of customer service.

"We fired our other night auditor about a month ago, the guy who works my opposite shifts. He was fired for stealing an iPhone from a guest and being caught on camera buying drugs in our resort. Not in the parking lot. In one of the actual hotel hallways. He’s an idiot and is probably looking at some jail time in the not too distant future.

But a new night auditor was just recently hired. She’s been trained all of two weeks and is apparently set to work this weekend on her own. Now I haven’t personally met her, nor have I trained her, as that was done by the fill-in night auditor who normally works swing shift and has more experience (and patience) than me. But already, some red flags have been raised. She’s called in sick twice in the two weeks she’s been training. Some locals who frequent the casino on our property have made mention that they know her and that she is not reliable at all and that she’s a heavy drinker and constantly missed her shifts at her previous job.

I’m pretty sure she was the first person who applied for the job and was snatched up out of desperation by our front desk manager. That was also the case with the last NA, the dumbass thief. So I’m pretty sure she isn’t going to last very long and we’re going to be back to square one again with only one full time NA, me.

We’ve gone through 4 NAs in two and a half years. It would be really great if we could find somebody who lasts longer than a few months.

"Just happened: 2 girls walked in ""hi, we are here to check in!"" But I see a bright ZERO on our arrivals for the day, so I asked ""all right, I understand you haven't made a reservation yet, right?"" To what they answered no, they had just made on through screwpedia. It was 00:30, so I assumed the reservation just went to the next day... But no, nothing there either. She shows me her confirmation email, and yes, there is a reservation... For 2 weeks from now 🙄 I asked her why she booked for the day and she nonchalantly replied ""oh, I don't know, I didn't even look at the date!""

"I feel like I have to share with you all because honestly it's just so funny and I'm having a whole blast (mostly because I haven't done anything wrong and none of this is my fault). Long story short is that someone allowed a guest into a TWO BEDROOM SUITE without a valid method of payment on file. Their card wouldn't authorize and then whoever checked them in TOOK A CARD NUMBER OVER THE PHONE and let them in on that.

Which is fun. That's cool.

So, today, my manager has been kind of giving this woman the benefit of the doubt. We sent her to our online auth form so she can ""prove"" the card is valid. Instead of filling this out, she tried to make a NEW reservation for the two bedroom suite and then do a ""digital key"" check in so she wouldn't have to come to the front desk. We blocked the digital key, but our hotel doesn't like to outright ""block"" people or cancel reservations without good reason, especially because they're supposedly shmilton honors members or w/e.

So then, when we blocked her getting in and checked out/rekeyed her ""inhouse"" reservation, she called the shmilton honors support line to try and get THEM to make us let her in.

Which is so funny to me. I ended up telling the woman at shmilton honors support, ""listen, we have reason to believe there's fraud involved in this, no one is getting into this room without a physical card at the front desk that matches the name on file and can be authed for the full night of stay"". WHICH IS WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

Like, don't get me wrong, this is a world of fuckups, but I'm having such a rickrolling blast telling this woman ""no"" by every available avenue.You would not believe the levels of OOF we're on right now",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Long time lurker but not in the Hospitality industry. However, I had a strange experience recently that I was hoping some you FD/NA peeps might be able to answer.

I traveled across state to a large metro center for a concert festival. As the usual 2-Star Hotel I stay at was across from the university and it was the start of Spring Break I had to look elsewhere for accommodations and found a great price on a 4-Star Hotel on the other side of the city that would normally be far out of my price range, so I had booked a reservation at the chain's website.

I took public transit, as my car was in the shop and I had to take a Greyhound to even get to town (this is potentially important). I walk past the Valet and smile in their general direction and walk through the front doors. I'm standing next to the doorman and as I'm glancing to my left and right to find out what side the Front Desk is on when the FD Clerk calls across the lobby ""**Frater Ormus, I have your reservation right here.**"" At first I didn't think twice about it and as I walk up to the desk he hands me my key and tells me when normal checkout is and to please let them know if I need a late checkout or anything else to make my stay more pleasurable. Literally a 5 second check-in. Didn't even ask for my Credit Card or ID. I didn't think it odd at the time because I was tired from a 7 hour bus ride on Greyhound and another hour bus ride on public transit. I wasn't thinking at all and just wanted to head off to my room to catch a few hours of rest before the concert that evening.

At checkout I wasn't asked for my Credit Card or signature either. That's when it occurred to me, **how did they know my name when I walked in?** They are a 175+ room luxury hotel in a major city. Surely I wasn't the only guest with a reservation that evening! Every hotel I've ever stayed in needs a physical Credit Card for incidentals and government issued Identification, and they asked for neither.

Don't get me wrong...everything about the accommodations was amazing. I highly recommend staying in a 4/4S/5 Star Hotel if ever the opportunity arises. The staff are beyond professional, the bed is to die for, and you can't hear even footsteps pitter-pattering down the hallway. 5/5 Stars, would definitely stay again if I could afford it! **But how on earth did they know who I was when I walked in the front doors and why was I not asked for ID or physical Credit Card**? Anyone have any ideas?

**Teal-Deer**: FD knew my name the moment I walked in the hotel. Did not ask for Identification or Credit Card at Check-In or Check-Out. Very strange and peculiar.Where Everybody Knows Your Name",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Y'all. This past month at my property has been nothing but stress. I work at the ""premier"" 147-room Schmoliday Out in downtown Randomcollegetown, USA and am down to my last three shifts. Since I am also a college student, I worked weekends and had class six days a week. Up until about a month ago, I could balance both work and school and not have a problem because even though it would get busy, I could still study in between check-ins. Then the biweekly scheduling and walkoffs started.

The first that I can remember was the night that was only supposed to have 24 arrivals. That's a cake walk, and nothing I can't handle easily on my own. So I go into work not really expecting much. I was relieving one FDA after a busy night, so when he hadn't gotten to counting the cash drawer, I didn't think much of it. Then I hit Shift-F3 and saw something I wasn't expecting: 104 arrivals for the night, and I was alone. I instantly switched into contingency mode and started texting my coworkers, seeing if someone could come in and help me get down to at least 50 before they left. No luck: my manager was in St. Louis celebrating some family function with his girlfriend, I just relieved one, and the other two were at opposite ends of the Interstate that runs through town, with at least an hour's drive back. One was in Chicago, the other in Louisville, and neither could get away, which meant it was just me. I steeled myself for the night and printed off my reports. And then it started.

Phones and check-ins and room runs, oh my! Housekeeping at my hotel has a track record of forgetting some of the basics, so room runs were a common theme that night. For the most part, people were okay with it. Yes, there were douche bags, but nothing out of the ordinary. That first night, I had someone ask me if it was just me since I'd left them on an ""interminible hold"", and I said yes. Turns out they were YHG owners and had scored a suite on a sold-out night for a dollar. They seemed understanding, but they were still annoyed. Sorry, lady. Not much I can do. After eight hours of crap, it was finally over. I sent my manager a screenshot of my Slopera screen and the scoreboard on the schedule and told him ""this is why biweekly scheduling doesn't work."" Of course, they're still doing this.

The next two weeks, I had to deal with the blowback from housekeeping walkoffs. Half our housekeeping staff, which was negligible at best, walked off the job and screwed me in the process. I know, it's stupid to think that I was the only one screwed over. And I wasn't. But I was the one who was going to get the blowback. And sure enough, I did. Every check-in I did, I had to put the name on a waiting list because people were arriving faster than I could put them in rooms. Best I could do is take thier ID and card, make a note in the reservation saying I'd already verified both, and then put them on the list and call when a room was ready. Most were fairly understanding about it, but there was this one woman who was a literal thorn in my side. Yes, you guessed it. She was a Karen who understood neither of the following: 1) I'm just a line-level front desk agent with almost no power to grant discounts or refunds, and 2) that I was just the messenger. She finally got her four rooms and headed upstairs, but not before bitching at me about how since she was a sparkly teir member, she should get a free upgrade on a sold out night. Yeah, nice try, Almyra Gulch.

Same thing happened with a Speyere member who came in and went right on the list. He proceeded to pull the ""I'm a top-teir idiot. Now is there a room ready?"" card. Nope. You're going on the list in the order you arrived, just like everybody else. Suck it up, buttercup. Yes, my friends, my patience was gone, but I at least managed to keep it professional and not use those exact words.

The next night, I was faced with the same thing. Except this time, we'd tried to block off the property so no new reservations could come through. Yeah, that didn't work. So I was overbooked on the type of room that everyone was trying to get into, leading to me walking six guests including a Speyere member. I almost got written up for that one since we still had kings with rollaways available, and the only thing that halfway saved me was reminding my manager that I was only following his directive: if they have two queens, keep them in two queens. He's kind of a Karen when he's wrong. For those who will blast me for it, I truly don't care anymore. I'd rather move on to aviation, which has been the plan all along.

The last couple weeks, it's been better, but not by much. Rooms were still being added when I got there since HK is still short staffed, but it wasn't nearly as bad. The waiting lists were only four deep at the max, and all of them were only for one room. But the damage was done. Grades at Randomcollege were slipping since I didn't have time to study, and if something's going to go, it's going to be my job. So I turned in my three-weeks' notice. I gave an extra week because I need money as well as I wanted them to be able to find someone to replace me. My last shift is two Saturdays from now, and I'm looking forward to being able to use my Saturdays and Sundays for spending time with my boyfriend, not being a human Gallagher tarp.

So yeah. That's the month that led to my resignation. And when I walk out those doors on the 21st, I'm going to the bar and downing a shot of Jameson to celebrate my departure from hospitality. It's been fun. To those who are still in, keep your heads held high and know when to back out.The Month That Led to My Resignation",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, I work in a mid-sized economy hotel in a decently sized tourist town in Central Ontario, Canada. I'm the full-time auditor, so I'm used to the weird stuff that only comes out at night. Anyway, it's 3AM, I've just finished running my audit, and I get a phone call from an American number, which immediately sends an alarm off in my head, only because I'm thinking it's one of our owners calling from one of his other properties located down south. I pick up the phone, and this is what follows:  
Me: Thanks for calling \[INSERT HOTEL NAME HERE\], this is CaptainAmero speaking, how may I direct your call?

Weird Phone guy:  Hello, with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with this fine evening? Are you the person in charge?

Me: It's CaptainAmero, and as of right now, yes. 

(At this point, there's some back and forth, because the name my parents chose for me has the tendency of screwing people up, in that if you replace the second and third letters in it with an A, you get the name of the person who's always looking for your manager. Thanks Dad for naming me after that one-time villain from Star Trek). 

WPG: Ah, of course. It's \*Garbled Static\* from Corporate, were you made aware of the incoming package to be delivered? 

Me: \*already suspicious at this point\* No one told me about a package being delivered, what is the protocol for this?

WPG: I just need you to confirm your manager's name, so we can continue. Could you provide their name now?

Me: Of course it's \[INSERT CLEARLY FAKE NAME HERE\]. Do you want me to get them on the phone? They're currently in-house (They weren't). 

WPG: No, that won't be necessary at all, I already have them on the line. Do you mind holding for just a second? 

Before I even get a chance to respond, he's already rattling off to the air, pretending to have a conversation with the fake manager, confirming details about a supposed package we're to receive, at 3AM. 

Me: Is everything okay? I can still hear you, you know.

WPG: Yep, just confirmed with your manager the details. He told me to tell you that you are to sign for the package, and to provide your government ID with the next person who calls you. May I have your cell phone number to transfer this call to, so the UPS correspondent can call through on the line?

Me: \*At this point, I know it's a scam, and decide to have some fun with it\* Of course, it's \[INSERT HOTEL'S NUMBER HERE\]. 

WPG: Perfect, I'll call it right away from my International line to confirm. 

The other line rings, with another number I have since confirmed came from a completely different State. I answer it.

Me: Hello? 

WPG: Heya CaptainAmero, I can hear you so much better now, dawg. 

(No word of a lie, these were his exact words).

WPG: Your work line is going to get a call from our UPS Correspondent, I want you to answer it, and when asked if you are receiving or declining the package, say you will receive it. He will ask you for your full name, DOB, and your Driver's License, or some other form of ID. Please give it to him when prompted.

At this time, the original line rings, with the original number, claiming they're from UPS, and they need to have the code word spoken that we will receive the package. The best part is, I can hear this call on the other line taking place in the background. 

Me: Listen sir, I have to go, my Manager just walked down to the lobby and is asking me who I am on my personal cell phone with. He's also telling me we aren't going to receive the package after all, thanks anyways. 

I then hung up both lines, called and left a voicemail on my Manager's cell phone, and went into my back office to load up a movie on Netflix to pass the time, when not ten minutes later, the same number calls my cell phone to try a similar but distinctly different scam with what they assume is an unsuspecting 24 hour retro video game service worker.

"I finally join the ranks of front desk workers who've been called racist for enforcing the rules set by management.


One of my first calls this morning was a woman asking about our pool. Is it indoor? Yes. What are the hours? 9am to 10pm. Then she goes on to say something about it being her daughter's birthday and having girls over to swim. ""Uuhhh, ma'am... We don't allow pool parties here. We don't allow any parties."" She goes back and forth trying to rationalize it, saying it'll only be about 6 girls. I said our rooms only sleep 5, so she'd have to pay for 2. ""Oh, that's not a problem!"" I said ""so you'll have an adult in each room?"" ""Well no, I'll be in one and the girls in the other."" ""No ma'am, there has to be an adult in every room and our rooms only sleep 5.""


After I repeated a few more times that we don't allow parties of any kind, she finally asked if parties was something we only allowed the whites to do and decided I was being racist.... Remember this is a phone call??  I said ""ma'am, I have no idea what you look like based on a phone call! Do you realize how silly that sounds?!"" She demanded to know my manager's name, which I gladly gave her along with the tip that he'd tell her the exact same thing I just did. She than said that complaining to my manager wouldn't be enough and she'd report me to (idk, I couldn't understand what she said).

"Had a guest come down at 6:05 am to checkout, then he gets super freaked out because he realizes the shuttle has left.  
I see his panic and try my best to calm him down, saying the shuttle had just left but should be back soon. 

I explain that our shuttle leaves every 15 mins, so 6:15am would be the next shuttle.   
That would only be a ten minute wait at this point, which I felt would be a relief for the guest to hear.   
This is clearly not the move as I spent the next  ten minutes being berated.

He personally spends more than I make in a year on hotels through the week

He knows how our shuttle and ALL HOTEL shuttles work because he has been a marine the last 30 years.   
I clearly MUST be new ( I am, so that was fair) because no one in the hotel would dare to speak to him like I had.   
He demanded a manager and when  I got mine, the guest then berated me for ""walking away from an upset guest"". 

My manager took lots of pity on me. Especially since this guy did the ""get the manager so I can keep yelling at you in front of them"" trick. Like why even pull another person into this is you're just gonna continue to cream at me?

"Last week I had this couple come up to me asking about the airport bus. Now my hotel is located in a valley comprised of three different towns, the airport being in the central town, while the town we're in being the northmost  inside the valley. In order to get to the airport most people ride in a taxi/uber but it's a small area so uber is limited to like 3 really chill old dudes.

This guy comes up to the desk asking about the bus schedule and he shows it to me. Our busses are notorious for being confusing so I crack a joke about it and take a look at the next bus coming to the airport. The only bus that take people there is called the ""Valley Route - Airport Connection"" as opposed to the regular ""Valley Route"" The main difference being the airport one comes every two hours and doesn't go there on weekends. Which is pretty dumb but aside the point.

I tell him the next bus will pick up at 12:12 in front of another hotel on mainstreet in our town. He thanks be and is being very polite, asking reasonable questions about the faire and things like that, but then his ever so pleasant wife rounds the corner asking be about the connecting bus.

I have no clue what she's talking about. Apparently someone told her there's a connecting bus that comes after you ride the valley route. Which there may very well be, I personally never rode that route specifically, and it is called *airport connections* something tells me that may possibly be the route they need. I inform her I don't know of any connections personally but the airport connection line should allow them to go to their location, if nothing else she could ask the bus driver if there is anything to worry about. 

She then throws a tantrum.

""This is clearly bad information, you have no idea what you're talking about. How can you work at a hotel and not know how the bus schedule works?!"" 

I replied pretty stoically; ""Unfortunately I don't travel via bus any longer, as I have a car now, but the schedule provides accurate information. If you have any concerns the bus driver will gladly answer your questions. I know where the nearest bus is, and what time it comes.""

""This is insane, you really need to educate yourself on this town."" 

Then her husband chimes in, whom I had a great repore with. ""Hun, he did the best he can, he's trying to help us, let's just get going. Thank you."" And then walks away quietly arguing with her.

Believe it or not, small towns offer limited public transportation. I get that it's frustrating, but if you are traveling somewhere do your research. We still have taxi services, and they are your best option to get to the airport as they come at *your* beck and call. Luckily they didn't need to catch a flight they were actually just going to rent a car, which was pretty funny to me. It's great when people pretend to know the area better than the locals. Even though I hadn't really rode that specific route, I know the schedule wouldn't lie, it wasn't false information, it was written down by the company that runs the route. If you're going to be pissy about something please at least try a little harder Karen, for the love of the lord....

Don't get me wrong if it is a staff issue. Staff being rude, yelling, housekeeping didn't clean their room (and they are gone for the day), or if we accidentally checked a guest into an occupied room.

A lady came up to the desk this morning asking if there were any Home Shows going on this weekend in the city (i.e. Boat Show, RV Show), so I did a quick Google search and informed her that there aren't any this weekend, but the Home Show happens to be next weekend. 

Lady: ""Well, years ago there was one where it combined a bunch! Like, a Home Show, Garden Show, something like that. Is that this weekend?""

Me: ""From what I can see online there are no shows this weekend.""

Then she gives me a look like it's all MY fault that the CITY doesn't have something going on for her.

"So we had a rough Sunday morning and I'm currently at the bar nursing my wounds before heading home.

We had an insane amount of late check out requests... I mean *demands*. We usually try not to go over our max of 15 late checkouts. And honestly our numbers are extremely low due to Coronavirus panic but we had a wedding group in house (Sunday wedding so plenty of departures and arrivals for same wedding, maybe 70~ or so rooms). We got up to 30 late check outs because ""super sparkly special member"" or evening shift ""promised"" they'd get a late check out. WHATEVER. Make the guest happy. To do that we agreed to later departures left and right. After 25+ late check outs I tried firming my stance and say ""no more late check outs"". It's 20 minutes until check out and Smishpedia guest demands late check out. I apologize and explain I can not accommodate, he had until noon maybe a few moment's after but I needed the room cleaned. After a back and forth, my heels dug in I offer $50 for 1pm hoping he'll drop it. No, instead he says I'm denying him his right to late check out because I'm racist against Asians. 

Bruh, for real? 'Cause daylight savings time effected your ability to check out at NOON? I went thru time change and got my ass up at 5AM just to have your ass say some offensive shit to me.

 I had to open a case for ""accusation of discrimination""and I'm exhausted. Can't do your job right without pissing someone off. Man, fuck this industry sometimes. I hope I get hit by a bus so I can finally retire from this crap.Accused of being racist for the first time ever",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"For some background, I’m from the United States and have been working in hotels for several years. I recently moved to a small town in Australia that is a popular holiday destination as it gives easy access to the Great Barrier Reef. I’ve been living abroad so long that most Americans don’t recognize my accent as also being American. 

When I moved here I started working for a small dodgy hotel with a surprisingly racist boss. Alas, this tale is not about said boss or any of the general shady characters I’ve been checking in and out over the past couple of weeks. It’s about this stereotypical Italian New Yorker who checked in this morning.

Around 9:30 am I was just highlighting some housekeeping reports. It’s Sunday, and I usually don’t see anyone till a bit later in the day. This lady comes in so I stand up to greet her. She doesn’t respond to my greeting and hands me some paperwork. It’s going to be that kind of day apparently. I ask for her last name which is no where to be found on the confirmation she’s given me. After several minutes her partner comes in and gives me their surname. 

Perfect! Your rooms ready early. She legit leans over the front desk until she’s way too close to my face and says in a very strong New York accent, Does this room have a kitchenette? That’s all I care about because we’re here for two days and I don’t want to starve. 

I told her honestly that I wasn’t familiar with all the rooms as I just started there, but I’m pretty sure her room did not have a kitchenette. This evidentially was not good enough, and I think she wanted me to go to the room to check before she accepted the keys? Finally I convinced her to check out the room first, and then if it wasn’t acceptable we would find a solution.

A bit later on in the day she comes back and announces that there’s a microwave in the room so she wouldn’t starve! How good. 

She starts to ask me typical questions about things to do and see in the area. This is one of my favorite parts of working reception- welcoming people to a new city and helping to shape their holiday.

I start explaining all the activities that you can do here. We have fantastic hikes, beautiful waterfalls, swimming holes, islands that you can spend the day at, snorkeling, cruises, beaches, scuba diving, etc. if you’re outdoorsy at all there’s honestly heaps to do here. 

She basically shoots down everything I’ve suggested. They’ve been to Niagara Falls so they aren’t interested in the waterfalls here. They used to live somewhere that had a coral reef so they’re over snorkeling. They live in Florida so they don’t want to do anything they could do at home like go to the beach.

I could tell she was getting agitated with me so I said oh I used to live in Florida! When Americans are at the front desk complaining, they always seem to relax a little when I mention I’m also American. Like I said earlier, they don’t seem to recognize my accent anymore.

But I miscalculated. Now she wanted to know about my family. Aren’t they sad that I abandoned them? Why did I have to move so far? She nearly fainted when I said I was an only child of a single mother. If she was my mum she would have been on a flight here to pack my bags years ago apparently. 

I tried to bring the subject back to the city and things to do but she was pretty much over it. She asked if we had any historic buildings? I was like to be honest, no. She then started claiming that it was totally boring here and how they wasted days on their holiday. I had a line at this point as she was complaining for a while.

She eventually left my desk with the idea to go to the supermarket. Which I was surprised by considering they have those in Florida. 

I’m extremely happy to have the next two days off. I love my job, but it always shocks me when people show up somewhere having done literally no research at all. Like usually when I buy a holiday I already have decided that I want to go there based on at least some googling??? Whooo knows. Happy Sunday everyone!American tourist complains to me for at least 20 minutes about the town she picked for her holiday being a boring waste of time",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We haven't been busy all night, I decided to eat my orange because I wanted my orange, I go and get my already cut up orange,  and I try to eat it. THEN THIS LADY CAME IN

We will call her dumb bitch.

Welllll Dumb bitch came in and has two rooms. A standard two bed room, and then a two bed suite, ok cool, I get my reg cards for her to fill out, and she only gives me her signature. Nothing else. I told her I need the car information, and her initials, as well as for her to fill out our new smoking/pet policy form. We made a completely different policy page for our smoking/pet policy, because people ignore it, now they can't ignore it, because they get pissy about having to fill out extra, and I go through the paper saying, ""You smoke, you are fined 250 bucks, and you're off the property, we are pet friendly please let me know about it though"", she refused to fill it out. She then starts telling me she has two dogs she wants to bring, I told her she has to pay 30 bucks for each animal. She then says one is an emotional support dog, and she doesn't have to pay for him. Welllllll issued by the ADA, you do have to pay for an emotional support dog and no longer count as a support animal, my hotel goes by the ADA standards, if they say ""support animal"", we have to accept it and not charge. However, if they say it is an ""emotional support animal"", they admit to it, we have to deny them, because they told us and they are breaking the rules of the ADA, this is stated on our pet policy as well. If they want a copy or proof of the ADA statement, we highlight where it is and give it to them. She complained about this. I just kinda stared at her.

I refused to give her the keys until she filled that shit out, because my boss said that was the only way for them to do it, if they don't do it, no keys, no keys no room, and we will delete the reservation, and just let you flip out till you're gone. We have done this before. We have no shame. SO JUST FILL OUT THE REG CARD AND THE SMOKING POLICY IT IS NOT THAT HARD DUDE, she then tried to get her 15 year old kid to fill out the reg card because she doesn't ""feel like it"", fun fact, our policy is  you have to be 21 to get a room here, and if you are not over 21, you cannot fill out the reg card, she did not like this and whined about the whole damn thing.

She finally does it. After 30 minutes of just waiting for her to fill out and complaining. It was like I was babysitting my spoiled 4 year old nephew, and in this case, I would rather deal with my nephew! I give her the keys. Now, I labeled the keys for the standard room and the suite. I told her which set of keys were for the standard and which one was for the suite. I handed her the suite keys, she then gives the keys to the suite to her 15 year old child and said ""this is yours"", I go back to my orange, I eat three slices. I am reading an article for school. And then I get a call from dumb bitch.

Dumb bitch instantly starts yelling and screaming at me about how she booked a two bed suite. Here is how it went.

Dumb bitch: I KNOW FOR A DAMN FACT I BOOKED A TWO BED SUITE WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

Me:......ma'am you're calling me from the standard two bed you booked

Dumb bitch: I SURE AS HELL AM NOT WHERE THE FUCK IS MY TWO BED SUITE

Me: you gave the keys to your kid.

Dumb bitch: I DID NOT

Me: you did, I labeled the keys so you wouldn't get confused of which room was which, and then you handed it to your daughter and said they were hers.

Dumb bitch: WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

Me: No idea, either way your kid has the two bed suite keys, and you're in the standard you book

Dumb bitch: THIS IS STUPID

Me: I agree

Dumb bitch hangs up, I go back and I finally eat my fucking orange, after an hour of dealing with this bitch, and walking her through a reg card to fill out and her just not accepting the fact we are not smoking, and her not realizing she gave her kid the wrong keys to her kid. Like dude. I just wanted to eat MY FUCKING ORANGE

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Dumb bitch just came up to me and told me the the cure for the coronavirus is cocaine. I asked where she had obtained this information, she said facebook. I am ready to quit this job, this might be my tipping point.

UPDATE2: She just called me freaking out because somebody called her room and nobody was there. I asked if she called her kid in the other room she has to see if they called them, because I remember her saying she doesn't have a phone, she said ""oooooo well I don't see why she would call me, I think somebody else is trying to call me, I need you to figure it out!"" My hotel is full of small kids who could have dialed her room on accident, I am pretty sure her kid in the other room called her trying to get a hold of her, and you're over here ignoring the obvious? I am pretty sure you're on cocaine thinking it will keep the coronavirus away, BECAUSE YOU ARE ACTING LIKE IT

UPDATE3: She just came to my desk and told me all about her husband cheating on her with a prostitute and used their tax return money to pay for it......................this is one of those situations where I just need to go home, because I don't know what to tell you beside take a nap. I just don't know what to tell you lady, like........................how can I help you? She then proceeded to tell me this was not the first time her has cheated, and then told me all of the accounts of him cheating. Like dude......I am just a simple front desk person.

"I don’t know how many other night auditors watch nightly as drunk people forget how to use doors. For me it is both hilarious and frustrating. 

At my hotel the motion activated sliding glass doors lock at 1am until 5am to help keep the crazies out. Guests can use their key card on a pad to the right of the door to make it open. There is also a doorbell to ring us if we don’t see them right away because we are in the office for something. 

Almost without fail on Friday/ Saturday overnights, drunk people coming back from bars get stumped by the door not opening...Due to some annoying safety feature the doors can be pushed open in the case of emergency. What results is possibly the most aggravating thing a guest can do in front of me at my hotel...

They put their disgusting hands on my clean glass doors and they push and they push and they conquer those locked doors without any inkling of an alternative solution. The worst is the accomplished look on their smug drunk faces when they gain entry through brute force. 

Putting up a sign explaining how to work the door at face level doesn’t stop them either. 

It actually makes my blood boil. If I were any less young, fit, and healthy it might give me a heart attack. 

DON’T TOUCH THE GLASS DOORS, PEOPLE! 

Bonus: the second set of doors normally operated by a doorman or propped open are kept closed at night. Guests stand there for long minutes waving wildly and getting frustrated with those ones. They are push doors which I have to go help them open. I must explain how a normal door works, often multiple times. I had one guy get so mad he came back in and shouted at me that the door wouldn’t work and how dare we and why don’t we have a 24 hour doorman like they do at “bigger city center” sister hotel.

"Okay.  It's official.  I've been asked the stupidest question ever.

Had a person walk into my lobby.  Walk up to me at the desk and ask ""Is this a hotel?""

Mind you, I'm standing under a giant sign that says ""[Franchise] by [brand] hotels"".  To walk into the lobby you must pass a giant sign that says [Franchise] Hotel and Conference Center.  There is a kiosk right inside the door with our event listings and ""[Franchise] Hotel and Conference Center"" on it.  I'm wearing a nametag that says ""[Franchise] by [brand] hotels"" on a shirt that says ""[Franchise] by [brand] hotels"".  I'm not even going to mention the multiple street side signage and the giant sign visible from the freeway...

"It's hasn't even been an hour into my shift and I'm already thankful tonight we spring forward 

Yesterday coworker on second shift checked in a very old vagabond. He is with his friend who is bouncing for a bar nearby. I guess when coworker checked in Vagabond, his card was declined for whatever reason so he paid with cash, because he did have money on his card. Don't know why it happened, but it could've happened for a lot of reasons. 

She has red hair, I have red hair. We do not look alike. 

Vagabond guest comes in drunk from the bar smelling like whiskey and weed, and starts addressing me as my coworker. Halfway through his rambling about the card incident, I just go,   
""I'm sorry sir that that happened, but I wasn't there during the initial transaction. I don't know how to address your card not being charged. I'm happy to hear you've got it figured out."" 

Ignores me and proceeds to address me saying that ,""stuff keeps changing and I need you younger type to know how to do your job because you're too busy facebooking"". 

Pulls out his *splintered* debit card, that I can already see why it was accepted by our cc machine, and talks to me about this new found charging thing called the ***chip*** that you have to make sure is inserted correctly in the machine in order for it to work. 

The phone goes off, which I thought would be relief from the vagabond, just for one of our foreign guests to call asking if we had a ""special massage parlor available for room service for dick massage"".

"I shared this story with a coworker and he said I had to share it here, so I'm going to try. 

I worked as a PSA for a hotel 4 years ago. The chillest and most boring job I've ever had, and one thing I did was take the trash out. Our dumpster was locked within what I would call an enclosure, so you had to unlock the gate to get access to it. I had a trash bag one evening, like 5 PM, and as I opened the gate I heard something in the dumpster. At this point I was assuming an animal was inside and I should just come back, but I wanted to check. 

As I entered and opened the dumpster lid, a mans voice came out and he said, ""Hey how's it going?"" In a very normal, nothing is wrong here way. I still couldn't see him, but I was having a weird night already so I threw the trash in and said, ""Not bad, how about you?"", confused. 

I take a step back and here the door on the side of the dumpster open and a dude walks over, like early 30's, polo shirt and brown khakis. I was kinda young and when this dude came out I legitimately had no idea what to say to this guy that was INSIDE our dumpster. What he ended up telling me was that he had stayed here a few nights ago and his daughter left a teddy bear and he was looking for it. I told him the trash got picked up that morning, and also you should call front desk and ask for lost and found for stuff like that. He told me to have a great day and left in what I remember to be an expensive looking car.

confused lady (CL): hi. i made a reservation for your property through *insert third party* but i got the city wrong. so can you just send my reservation to the other property in different city?

me: *already getting a headache* unfortunately, i can’t do anything for you because you booked through a third party. you will have to call them and cancel, then rebook. 

CL: *absolute silence for 1 minute* they told me to call you. so just do it. 

me: i’m sorry but they were mistaken. i can’t even touch third party reservations let alone cancel them. everything must be through the site you booked with. 

CL: okay but this isn’t my fault so just give me my money back.

me: i’m sorry that *you* booked in the wrong city, but again i can’t cancel even if i wanted to. and i have no money to give back because you booked with a third party. 

CL: so who has my money?

me: the third party does, because you booked with them. you need to call them back and cancel, then rebook in the city you need to.

CL: why can’t you just send my reservation to the new hotel?

me: because even though we are the same chain, i don’t have access to their systems. and don’t know which hotel you want, and if they have availability. 

CL: *absolute silence and what i assume to be shock*

"So I’m obvs. not a front desk employee, but I lurk here to see what to avoid doing so I’m not one of those assholes. 

SO. I’m at a medium size conference near the Dulles Airport. On the way, my assistant lets me know she checked us into the hotel and has our keys. 

Hit the breaks. I’m the only person registered on this room. I ask for more info, and she says she just went to the front desk and let the FD know my name... and they gave her a key. 

Now my assistant is young, she didn’t know that they SHOULD have said no. But they just handed her keys. 

Now I’m not naming names, but this is a very large international company. (I’m in the US, btw)

I meet my assistant in the lobby, she hands me the keys and nopes the fuck out. I told her I was pissed, but didn’t plan on making a big deal of it, and she felt bad and didn’t want the FD glaring at her. 

I go check in. “Oh, you’re already checked in.” 

“Oh really? Because I just arrived.”

“We gave... oh sorry, my mistake. Wrong person. Here are your keys.”

They’re trying to cover for the fact that they gave my keys out to a possible stranger. I offer the ill gotten keys; “Do you want these back then? The keys you have to someone NOT registered to my room?” (Note: I didn’t raise my voice, but I didn’t get quiet either. I didn’t yell or make faces or anything. I hate those kinds of people.)

“Well she knew your name.”

“I’m a vendor at this event, everyone is gonna know my name. Did you hand keys out to anyone else?”

Their face is getting red. My face is too. I HATE confrontation, but if I know anything from this subreddit, you don’t give out keys to people who aren’t registered to the fucking room! I’m a single woman, and disabled. Primo target for an offender. I know what I look like. 

“No, only her. She gave her ID.” 

“She could have been ANYONE.”

“Well I moved you to a new room, here are your keys. Can I help you with anything else?”

I just grumble and limp off. 


I’m not out to lose anyone their jobs. That’s elitist bullshit and I’m not a goddamn Karen, so I’m asking you: what should I do? How can I report this to at LEAST get staff remedial training before they fumble themselves into a lawsuit?  

I don’t know what to do, but I feel that SOMETHING should be said.


Update: after a good sleep uninterrupted by random people walking in, (upon your recommendation) I went down to the FD and spoke to the manager. I made it clear I didn’t want anyone fired, but she did coax me into giving my name so she could ID who it was that gave out my room key. 

At one point, she asked who walked into my room- I had to quickly correct her that nobody came into my room, no intrusions, no (physical) security breach.  She kept asking if there was anything she could do for me, and I kept declining. I could tell she was used to people demanding recompense, but really there was little I needed. Like I said, I’m really bad at conflict, and so am not accustomed to making demands, so I literally could not think of what they could do to make it up to me. I don’t really travel a lot, so a free night in one of their zillions of hotels would probably be a waste.

" Gawd. 

I wasn't even clocked in yet. I showed up early for my shift tonight, knowing we were going to sell out. So I'm in the doorway behind the desk, talking to my co-worker who is in the back. It's 10:39 which is 'technically' too early to lock the doors so people are coming in to check in and going out to get something to eat, smoke, go drinking. Whatever. 
 I see a guest walk in out of the corner of my eye and I go to help- until he greets me with my name and I recognize the voice immediately. 
 There is Mobile Man, sliding his I.D. to me, saying he has a reservation. I instantly slid it back and said "" I'm sorry sir, but due to how you acted last time my GM has said that you're no longer welcome at our property,""
  Mobile Man is mad, but he's the kind of mad that starts soft and slowly builds. He's asking what behaviour, what did he do/say? Then he starts saying it was because I didn't help him. I told him that he continuously cut me off and insulted me multiple times with profanities. Over an issue that no one would've been able to ""help"" you with. To which he asks for a manager. I take one of my GMs cards out from the desk and slide it to him telling him he's in at 9 on Mondays. Then I asked him again to leave the property. 5 seconds to get out of my doors, please. 
 Then I took the phone and went to the back. To my surprise he seemed to leave quietly, however when my co-worker left she handed me about 20 of my GMs cards from off of the floor. 

 All in all it wasn't very climatic but it was decently amusing to see a grown man come back to the same hotel (twice!) that he said was shit, then get mad that he isn't allowed to stay here. Die mad, my guy. Die mad.

They wanted a room, so I began talking with them to figure out what type of room they needed. They stopped me and said with confidence ""Whatever your nicest, most expensive room is will do fine."" Immediately put off by this red flag, I continued talking to them to try and gather some info and they promptly cut me off again to tell me ""We don't deal in anything but cash, and we have a lot of it!"" I pointed to the sign and informed them that we're a credit only hotel and that if they don't have a card, then I simply could not rent to them. This immediately inflated their confidence and gave them a smug attitude, and they began to try and bribe me into letting them stay. First, the gentleman told me that they had friends who ""owned a (nonexistent) hotel down the street."" I insinuated that it didn't matter, and the woman pulled out a sizable wad of cash from her bag and started waving it around. ""Well I have a lot of cash and we tip our hotel staff well.""

"People liked my last post about my experience as campground manager so here is a much requested second. The last one was about the lady being afraid of trees. I will post a link to it later. It kinda came off as me just shitting on tourists, which was not the point (but something i love to do nonetheless). I mentioned before, this was a campground mostly visited by locals. It was a pretty nice place and a hidden gem off the beaten path in central wisconsin. This is about one of the more unique sets of local guests. 

My first meeting with them was pretty normal. They had been guests in years before i worked there, so they knew how the flow of things went.  

The looked like your average older couple in the middle of their lives. I should also mention that these lives were full of bad diet, booze, drugs and smokes. Looking like the cast of House of 1000 Corpses is not a reason to kick anyone out, so i just checked them in normally and went on with my day.

A few hours later they met me to buy firewood and I could tell their looks match their personalities.  The Wife was in a nightgown that she never tied tight enough and man in old jeans and a faded tee shirt that came free with a 30 case of beer, 30 years ago.  They chatted in that way sped up people do, smoked about 6 cigs in 15mins between the the two. They paid for their site, and their firewood so I finished my shift and traded off with my partner and left for the day.

The next day I am coming in and getting the keys from my partner. He proceeds to ask me about the weird couple, and tell me how other sketchy looking dudes had been hanging out around there fire around 7pm, but when he drove by later they all were in the camper with loud music. This was a real small pop up camper and it was nice out. The following few rounds my partner did, the husband or another guy or two would be smoking around the fire while the rest where in the camper, it was usually a different combo of dudes out by the fire each time.

Later on when the couple checked out the woman made some comment to my partner about stoping over to hang out n have a beer next time he works at night, giving him a wink. When he left that day, he went home, showered and sobbed in his wifes arms. 

Lucky me to work the night shift for their next stay. This time it was a busy weekend. The had a site in the more popular part of the campground as well. They were eager to show off their new-to-them RV that could barely run and reaked of gas and exhaust. They offered to drive to the firewood shed, but i decided to just deliver it myself. Having that thing driving around by them when we were that busy, seemed like a horrible idea. 
I do so and they apreaciate it, i will say they were never rude in I or my partners dealings with them.  I make sure to unload it and gtfo.   

That night they dont have a party. Husband had been drinking Kessler all day as well. About 12am i get woken up and called over for a disturbance from their site.  I ask their neighrbors whats up and an informed that the couple are screaming, but no one has saw or heard anyone being hit so i didnt feel the need to call a cop yet. 
The first things i hear is him yelling about how she is a bitch and then her yelling that he is an asshole. He responds by saying again she is a bitch and he us not an asshole, and she yells that he is indeed asshole because and I qoute 

""YOU BEAT ME, YOU BEAT THE DOG, YOUR BREAK THE FUCKING TRUCK, YOU FUCKING DRUNK ASSHOLE""
to which he replies
""I NEVER HIT YOU FIRST AND YOU KNOW IT! FUCKING BITCH-SLUT""

At this point I get noticed and they both start chatting at me, telling me their side of things. I should also note, that no one looks hurt or has torn clothing, ect. I stop them quickly cause, i really dont give a damn. I just want them to STFU. 

I let them know I am not at all in the slightest interested in their lives.  I dont want to know details, I really dont care. However when the volume of their drama is enough to upset others, i do care about the volume of it. 

I explain that I could make them leave right now and if they dont, get them charged for trespassing.  If they leave the RV, i could fine them, or have it towed, however they are drunk so if they drive away I will also call the police to report them. I have their names plate numbers and home address on file. They are smart enough to realize they have no choice but to beg for my forgiveness. They do and agree to be model campers from then on. 

To their credit, from then on, they were perfect, if a little creepy campers. They still had their parties and The woman copped a feel on my assistant a few times, and once gave him a longer then needed hug with nothing between her knee-length breasts and him, but a silk nightgown and no bra. 

I also made sure to put them in a certain campsite that was a bit farther from the rest, and kept delivering firewood, mostly for the protection of other campers. So yea after that, model campers, except for some light sexual misconduct/assault.Campground Tales 2; The old Drunk Swingers on the Hill.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hi y'all second post on here and thought I'd share with you my first night solo as night auditor, and what ensued i'm laughing at now, but at the moment was absolutely horrifying. 

I've been training for awhile just to do coverage for call off's. Just some background, my property is a pretty regular 3 star chain located near my city's downtown w. a pretty heavy homeless population, but I try not to judge books by their covers

So I had trained a few weeks back, and yesterday night we had a call off so I went in. Now, I have been doing Front Desk for a year now so I have had my fair share of entitled experiences, fraud, theft, etc. But I have not worked night audit by myself and don't have too many homeless encounters. Well tonight I see a woman in her late 50's-ish come in wearing a over-sized hoodie with the hood all the way over covering her forehead like a sith lord and sandals. Like I said, i really try not to judge because you never know, maybe that's just how she goes to sleep. She comes up to the desk muttering to herself, and I ask if she is here to check in. She goes "" DUH, it's under Tabatha"" and then repeating it under her breath. Obviously I see nothing there so I quickly realize she is not a guest at my property nor probably any property for that matter. I didn't know what she was on so I proceeded cautiously. ""I'm sorry, but I just don't see that reservation, are you sure you are at the right property"" And she goes ""Yes I am sure, it's under tabatha!! Check again, the owner made it for me PERSONALLY"" and then muttering more under her breath. This is hilarious because we are independently owned, but licensed by a big corp. and I know the owners literally live in China most the year and would not have anything to do with this woman. Finally she goes ""Do YOU NEED THE PASSWORD"" and at this point I lose any sort of customer service composure and pretty much go ""lol what?"" and she then pulls her hands out of her pockets and shoves them in my face over the desk and SHE HAS NO FINGERS except maybe 2 or 3 combined and goes "" THIS is the password"" and is tryyying to TOUCH ME with HER STUBS. I am absolutely horrified that I about to be touched by her stubs. She stops and I go reaaaal quietly because I was gonna lose my shit "" you need to be out of my lobby in 30 seconds or I'm calling the police"" and she starts giggling and muttering and walks into the night.Back again!

"I made a post sometime last week about my concern for one of our new employees.  A young housekeeper that was using her employee discount to rent rooms and had men of different ages coming and going at all times during night shift.

Most of your replies urged me to talk to management about her because it seemed obvious that her and her friend were either selling their bodies or drugs.  I updated the post because the last I heard, she didn't show up to work and was unable to be reached, so she was let go.

So she didn't work at all while I was off of work for three days or the other days that last week, so she didn't contact us for 5 days or so.  

Today, while working 2nd shift, she pops in and asks for keys to the pool so her and her friend can swim.

I said that last I heard, she didn't work here anymore.  This made her super pissed, getting all huffy, sighing, and rolling her eyes at me.

She claimed that she worked today in Housekeeping and that our manager said it was okay if they came swimming tonight.

Me: That's fine, then it won't be a problem when I call GM to confirm that.

GM didn't answer phone so I messaged her and told the girls I would let them know when she got back to me.  They stood at the desk just staring at me for a few minutes until I told them it may be a few minutes, so just take a seat and be patient.

The whole time they waited (less than five minutes) they were shit talking me about how stupid I am.  I just ignored them.  18 year olds can be really immature...

I got a reply from our GM almost instantly after I told them to sit down and wait.  She said that the housekeeper came in today and apologized for not showing up, so our GM gave her a written warning and let her come back to work.  Said it was okay if they want to use the pool as well.

I brought up my previous concerns about the room rentals.  GM said it won't happen again and that she is a good worker.

I waited a few more minutes and then gave them a key to use the pool.  No thank you, just an ugly sneer from her and her friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I really really really wish we had some sort of waiting period before employees could use the amenities, but whatever.  Thinking about swinging down by the pool in an hour or so to see how many people she sneaks in there, but at this point, I don't know if I should even care anymore.  Clearly my GM doesn't see an issue with her and we are short staffed as it is.Questionable Employee is Back!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is an update to my last post concerning a gentleman who wanted to book online after the cut off. I've dubbed him Mobile Man and this is (hopefully) our last stand off. A kind Redditor posted the original link in the comments if you'd like to read the first part. 

So I come into work tonight and start reviewing my arrivals list and lo and behold who do I see on my list tonight? 

Mobile Man, I shit you not. 

 I immediately get on the phone with my manager to see how HE would like me to go forward. While he takes business into reguard, he does NOT take any bullshit or anything that smells of it. While on the phone, my GM says the most magical words to grace my ears: ""Cancel him. He's banned."" 
So I go to my terminal and in less than 30 seconds his reservation is gone. 

Now, this is the kicker: Mobile Man has not shown up yet.

 I don't know how this will go or how he'll take it, but either way he isn't stepping one foot into the hotel; my door locks after 11 and no unregistered guests are allowed on the property. I'll keep you guys updated but hopefully he'll just leave.

UPDATE: I've just gotten off of a pleasantly quiet and uneventful shift. Mobile Man never showed in person, but about 20 minutes before my shift ended I got a notification on the computer from our ""Customer Service"" system (guests can submit complaints/request extra amenities/ask questions, etc.) which, everyone at the desk can access, but also goes directly to our Front Desk Manager's and General Manager's inbox. I left before my GM came in to read over the complaint (as only he can address those) but when I left my FDM was grinning from ear to ear.

"Ayyyeee , Ive never had a tale to tell before but as of this morning I finally have one.

I recently became the full time Night Auditor after doing relief audit for like 6 months. So far its been fine, I'm really enjoying it and haven't found the hours to be to bad at all.

But anyways onto the story. 

It was around 2:30 am and an Uber pulls up to my lobby and 2 visibly drunk guys get out. I recognize one of them as a regular that stay here on an authorization with a group of construction guys. The other I don't. The one I don't recognize comes into my lobby and ask where the nearest liquor store is. I tell him non are open at this hour. He then tells me he knows I have beer and wine (we do, but not for say, for our reception only) and that I have to give it to him. I tell him no and to go to his room. He does fuck off to his room for a bit before coming back 20 mins later, which a 12 pack in his hand. The Regular Guest is nowhere to be seen.

 He continues to harass me about giving him alcohol and weed for close to 30 mins. He then pours some beer into a cup and hands it to me. I refuse but then take it and just set the cup down next to me, planning to pour it out when he leaves me alone. He continues to just drunk ramble and bug me for more alcohol. I finally get it out of him that he's not even staying here and that he's staying with his friend in room XXX. I am fed up with him at this point and drop my customer service voice and tell him he needs to either go to the room or leave, but either way he needs to not be in my lobby right now. He begins to cuss at me and say he's going to complain to corporate. I tell him that I don't care, but he needs to leave my lobby. 

He then starts trying to get me to charge a bunch of stuff to our mini store to the room. I tell him that I wont because it's not his room. He then calls his friend (the actual guest) and tells him to come down and ""deal with this girl."" ( I shudder at what he had in mind, thankfully that's not what played out.) The guest comes in and I immediately tell him that he needs to get this guy and go, and the guest just tells him to come on, and tells me its not his problem. The problem guy then asks me for his cup of beer back. I hand it over to him and he proceeds to throw it in my face and all over my desk. He drops the cup and starts to walk away. Instinctively I grab the cup and hurl it back at him. (It was only one of those 160z coffee cups) Him and the guest walk away and I'm just FUMING. I run outside after them and tell them I'm calling the cops and his boss. I go back inside and break down crying. 

I call the cops and then my supervisor. When the cops come they tell me since he's so drunk they cant evict him because they don't want him getting in his car and leaving, and they cant arrest him unless he was standing outside. They tell me they will trespass him and he HAS to leave first thing in the morning or he will be arrested. When they come back from the room they say that the guy isn't there but they told the other guys in the room that if he comes back he will be arrested and he's not to come back to the property ever. 

And that's pretty much the end of it for now. My supervisor was half asleep when I called and not entirely coherent. He mostly just apologized and said he would stand behind me if I evicted the entire room as opposed to just the guy. I called my other coworker who lives down the road and is awake at this time and she came and helped me clean up the desk. It was all over our phone and key maker and in our bucket and everything. It was terrible :/ 

Im just waiting out the rest of my shift, and I know every guest is looking at me funny because I reek of beer. What a great night.


Edit: thanks for the gold! 
Also an update: my manager called the company and the boss over there was LIVID about it. He was suspended and will be fired if his friend ever comes back. He came in to apologize later in the day I guess and my manager told him it’s not her he needs to apologize to, so he’s going to call me tonight I guess.Guests' friend throws beer in my face this morning :/",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"...and this may cost me a large amount of cool points.

UGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!

I hate having problems on my shift.  But for the last week or so, I've actually had no problems at all; in fact, it's been relatively quiet.

My shift reports are usually very long because they are very detailed -- even to the point of my own detriment.  I put in everything that each person involved has said, every actions, and my thoughts.  It's  verbally animated, and my co-workers have told me they look forward to reading them lol.

Well, tonight is a doozy.  First, I came in early and didn't even start reading my pass along emails until after my shift started.  I had just clicked on the one that I needed to read for this particular guest when they walked in.  They had booked for a double queen suite, but we were out; I didn't realize this either until after the fact.  (I was just zoned out this evening because I usually do ALL of this at the very start of my shift).  Well, the Mrs. gives me her name and tells me that they have already been checked in, and are just needing to pick up keys for their two rooms.

Okay, sure...simple enough, right?  But wait...

She or the Mr. then says, it's a room with a rollaway bed or a pull out sofa, right?

I tell them no, I have two rooms for you...one is a king and one is a standard queen.  No pullout sofa, but I'll upgrade you a suite.

He or she tells me, ""No.  We called and spoke to (another associate) who has already upgraded us.  We just need to pick up the keys.""

Sure.  But if you need a room with a pullout that's not this room, I'm just letting you know.

""No, no.  But we booked a....hold on, let me just find the confirmation email.""  -The Mrs.

While the Mrs. is trying to find the confirmation, Mr. is gearing up for a battle that I'm not ready for.

Mr. is saying that it's after midnight (it was 11:58 pm, but close enough), and that they were already checked in, and why am I making this so difficult?   I told him that I wasn't, but I wanted them to know that they are not in the room they booked if they need a pull out sofa bed.

The Mrs. found the confirmation and on the confirmation it did state that they were booked for a Queen Suite.  Cool.  Okay...so that's not what you have if you need a pull out sof....

""No.  We have our rooms, just us the keys!""

Bu...

""YO!  JUST GIVE US THE KEYS!  WHY DO YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE?!?""

I don't have an attitude.  You're agitated, but I'm just trying to get you what you booked.""

""WHOA!  Back Up!  I'm Not Agitated!""  At that point, I just stopped addressing Mr. and only address the Mrs.

Okay, Mrs., here are your keys.  I'm sorry about the confusion.  If you have any problems with the rooms, please let me know.  But just be aware this room will not have a pull out sofa bed as your confirmation states.

Then I go on to give them the information about breakfast and so forth.

After they leave, I go to the back and continue to read my emails...that's when I find what happened to their room.  Apparently we ran out of Queen suites, and they were placed in a standard double queen and a standard king that were adjoining.

DAMNIT MAN!  If I had only kept reading, all of that could have been avoided.  UGH!!!!!  I could kick myself.  I really beat myself up over shit like this.  No one else seems to make these kind of mistakes.  And I don't consider myself combative at all, but shit like this makes it comes across as if I am.  Fuck Me.

"Hi all. I had one of those “what the fuck else could possibly go wrong?” days today.  Turns out, a lot more things went wrong but that’s a story for another day. 

I work in a luxury boutique resort for a small brand. We get a lot of interesting travelers, both good and bad. today i had a new experience. 

We had a guest arrive who refused to sign the registration card, saying his religious beliefs prevented him from doing so. He’s part of a group, so his room and tax are covered, but incidentals such as room service, the spa etc were his own responsibility and those slips need to be signed. he also said he won’t sign any of those tickets. 

I’m the FOS so I said we will mark the room as no-post if he refuses to authorize his own charges. He loses his mind and walks away without resolution. 

Is this a real thing? If it is, and i’m being unnecessarily judgemental, i want to know and i’ll find a solution with him. But i’ve never heard this before and my friend google wasn’t helpful either.

"We do a lot of events at our hotel so we have a large and experienced events staff. I work in the events side of the business and I work in one of the more client facing side positions. 

Recently we had a fairly small event in one of our ballrooms that was expected to get smaller because of corona virus panic. We already knew they were going to ask us to remove some tables and chairs and we just needed to ask how many to remove but the main client hadn't come in yet. 

As soon as she came in she walked around the room and started complaining about everything. I couldn't even get an introduction in before the complaints started. She finally circles around to the back of the room and asks where my manager is. (I am already dressed better than a manager would be but she assumes since I am younger I am not one)

I don't even want to deal with this at this point so I call over the manager and as he is walking over she tells me everything thats wrong. I tell her oh you don't need a manger I can have all that done for you, she ignores me, but just to be proactive I call over a housemen to get it done. I explain it to him in front of her she ignores me. Manger gets in she explains it all to the manager, he goes to tell the housemen and halfway through she cut him off and starts explaining it like he hasn't already heard it 2.5 times. The houseman gets it done in about 5 minutes and we were hoping that would give her some confidence to just let her deal with the staff in the room as opposed to calling a manager every-time. Nope they ended up having to assign a manager to the room as she refused to even speak to anyone else. (She would complain and tell us all her problems but then insist on speaking to the manager about it.) At this point we all just avoided her making all her requests take twice as long because she had to call the manger personally to have him explain her requests in person. Half the things she asked for could have been done by the staff already in the room the other stuff just required one of them to have someone come take things away or bring things.

"This week has been one of those weeks that has made me want to leave my keys on my desk and become a mechanic. I'm a gm at a hotel owned by a group of investors that have ownership in about 400 hotels [OG]. We are managed by an even bigger company [MC] which has more cons than pros in my opinion. Imagine the meme where the hand is in the water asking for help, the hand on the boat give the drowning hand a high five and the person drowns, but I digress. We got word from our MC that OG wants us to cut expenses across the board by 20%, labor and all because hotels in other markets have taken a hit due to coronavirus travel restrictions. I've been in this industry 15 yrs, I get it, but its bullshit that we have to cut cause of some hotels in god knows where are not meeting revenue goals. Anywho, I've been busting my ass trying to make the least amount of payroll cuts as I can. Been putting in 12 hrs a day combing through budgets and forecasts and revenue and CPOR and HPOR and MPOR trying to minimize cuts. I finally was able to get it down to where everyone in my hotel will virtually only lose an hour a week. I break the news to everyone and of course, they are not happy. My housekeeping staff takes it the worse, complaining that they live paycheck to paycheck and this will hurt them, bla, bla, bla, I get it. I'm a very empathetic GM and I really, genuinely care, so does my leadership team. We have 3 other hotels in our city that have the save MC, but different OG groups to see if we our employees are able to work at those properties if we are not part of the same OG and they say yes, that they are in desperate need of housekeepers. Eureka! Problem solved. I gather my HK team and let them know that I know this is stressful and affecting them so I was able to find a solution. When I say this one of them legit tells me, ""that's great, I'm a single mom and i need hours"". I tell them they can go work at other MC hotel, ask who would like to volunteer,  crickets. I reiterate, they will be working one or two days a week tops, 16 additional hrs guaranteed,  I get blank stares. I tell them ""ladies, we have a problem,  I present you with a solution,  and nothing?"" One says 'I have too many personal things going on, sorry'. I'm thinking ""what the motherfuck??""

"This is a long one. 

Hello fellow FDAs. I'm here with another tale from my 100 room independently owned Sunshine Inn. 

This is a tale from last work week, and encapsulates the worst night of the hotel life I have ever experienced. 

Last Saturday I was working shift 2. We have had some long term stay guests that have been rather problematic for our staff (refusing HSK, berating staff, sneaking pets into the room and general bad behavior). Their house apparently burned down and Red Cross is paying for their stay. They will be identified as Shitty Guest 1 and 2, and have two rooms in our property's smoking section. They were staying across the hall from a man who had checked in for just a few days, who will be identified as Meth Guy. 

Meth Guy had been problematic for different reasons. He checked in claiming to be a good friend of the family that owns the hotel, but was somehow unaware the family was out of the country and had been for three months. Despite this, he felt it was necessary to remind us of his friendship with the family LITERALLY every time he interacted with staff. He had a penchant for wandering the property shirtless and shoeless and walked into our lobby with a lit cigarette multiple times. This guest also called the front desk five or six times asking us to call him a cab, and was informed each time that all cab companies in the city were out of business. 

At some point last Saturday Shitty Guest 1 and 2 got into some sort of feud with meth guy. I tried to be uninvolved with this, as I wasnt inclined to trust either party on the matter. Shitty Guests called me complaining that Meth Guy was harassing them. I wrote this off until Meth Guy entered my lobby to inform me that Shitty Guests ""dont belong here"" and he told them to leave. I told Meth Guy to mind his own business and hoped that would be the end of it. 

Oh how wrong I was. 

Shitty Guests and Meth Guy got into a battle of calling in noise complaints on each other. They went back and forth a few times and I was preparing to evict all parties involved when I received a call from Shitty Guests saying that Meth Guy had exited his room naked and was running around the hotel in the nude. 

This greatly concerned me and I immediately locked the lobby to go search for this guy. I went to his room first, and nobody was inside, so I changed the locks. I then spent 20 minutes combing the property for Meth Guy, with no success. 

I returned to the lobby, knowing Meth Guy would eventually go there for keys, as I locked his room. When i returned, I had two guests that were angrily waiting for me, wanting a refund. One guest informed me that a man matching the description of Meth Guy had attempted to forcibly enter her room five separate times during the night. She was refunded and left without much more fuss. 

The second alleged that meth guy had pulled a knife on him, and had attempted to rob him. He did not request a refund and returned to his room. 

I called the police at this point, which I hate to do because I'm the only employee on the property, and it's hard to deal with police on the premises and conduct the hotel business at the same time. The police arrive and begin to search the property. 

It is at this point that the night auditor arrived early for her shift, which i was tremendously thankful for. I asked her to go speak to the police near the back building. While she was doing that, Meth Guy entered the lobby requesting new keys (fully clothed thankfully). 

I was able to stall him in the lobby long enough to covertly text my night auditor and have her bring the cops to the lobby. After about twenty minutes of arguing with the police, Meth Guy was arrested and his wife was also removed from the property, swearing the whole time that the owning family had betrayed him by having him arrested. 

I ended up staying late at work that night giving a statement to police. It was an incredibly stressful night. Shitty Guests ended up staying over the next night, despite my notes to not extend them, so I suppose in the battle of the Methed-up Sex Offender and The Family of shitty guests, The Family wins this round.Methed up sex offender vs. The Family of Shitty Guests.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"Hello my friends! You may remember me for my tale about saving a lizard. Well today, I bring to you another unbelievable and *fresh* tale about saving chicks, brought to you by a meeting room guest. 

We had a small meeting room rental today that was conducting a group orientation. Each person that arrived for said meeting stopped by the front desk to ask for directions to our meeting room. Like a flight attendant, I'd hand-gesture and give verbal directions before sending them off. One of the attendees caught my eye, not just because of the nice green top she was wearing (as oppose to the rest who wore black button-ups), but because of the faint chirping noise that seemed to emanate from her. Not thinking much of it aside from *oh, cool notification tone*, I gave her the directions and sent her on her way. 

An hour or so later, they began to trickle out one by one. Green blouse lady stops by and asks me if she can have some coffee from the coffee bar. Normally we charge the meeting room rental an additional fee for those that get coffee, but since it wasn't a big rental and no one would notice 5-10 cups missing on a slow day, I gave her and everyone else the go-ahead. At this point, I notice the chirping again. It's loud enough to where you can hear it if you're standing next to her, but soft enough to where if it went off in a quiet room, no one would really notice it. Now I'm  not sure if my friendly disposition or the fact I welcomed her to the coffee had gained her trust, but she looked at me with a small smile and asked if she could show me a secret. I'm a curious person, so sure, why not?

I kid you not, she reached into her shirt and produced an adorable black chick! It was so tiny and could easily fit in one's cleavage. I was in aw and going derpy over it's cuteness, yet still I couldn't help but ask the obvious: why?! So she explained to me that she lives in a rural area and its the time of year where their hens are hatching their offspring. For some reason, one particular hen just walked away from her babies, and some of them didn't make it! So on her way out to go to this meeting, she noticed the two chicks that survived and quickly scooped them up. Since she was running late already, she didn't have time to put them in a warm place. So her next best option? In her shirt, and off she went. 

I applaud her for her ingenuity  and bravery to show up for a new job orientation with baby chicks in her shirt (and for obviously saving their lives). She confided in me how silly she must've looked holding her hand over her heart to stiffen any excessive noise and had even apologized to the instructor, who also seemed to not mind. She even let me pet one and take it's picture! I can't wait to tell my SO when I get home a happy tale versus the usual (and unusual) complaints I get.A Chick With Chicks",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

At least, not to everyone else; she'll be perfectly cordial to your face. This means she complains about management - over even the most menial things - all the time to anyone who will listen.

One weekend we sold out completely. Susan was asked to make housekeeping boards because our Head Housekeeper (HHK) was going to be late. She made them - including giving HHK her own board of 15ish rooms. Our AGM ended up telling her not to worry too much about her board, and to focus on her *Head* Housekeeper duty of checking every room. For the next week, Susan bitched and bitched about how HHK didn't clean her rooms. 

S: ""She was here until *five*, how could she not get them done?""  
Me: I heard it was because AGM told her not to worry about it  
S: Well, that was stupid on AGM's part!

There was also a situation that was... admittedly a little eyeroll-inducing, but not nearly as bad as she made it out to be.

We had a high-tier member guest, who had been given a comp upgrade to a king suite, come to the desk. TL;DR of his request: he was here for a month for work, and his wife and kids were coming up on the weekends to see him. He wanted a room with a bathtub (in our hotel, that would have to be a Double) for the kids to use. NBD, we get him switched and he heads out. The annoying part: he came right back and said ""actually, I didn't think about it at the time but... The suite has that wall that makes it like there's 2 separate rooms. I think the extra privacy will help me sleep while the kids are here. Sorry, can I move back?""

I asked if he'd moved anything into the new room yet, and he says no; he'd just gone in to check it out. Great; we don't even have to mark the room dirty. But I'm off the clock at this point, so I go get Susan.

Susan proceeds to roll her eyes in the most dramatic fashion possible before going to the desk to help the guy. Our computer system has us type in the reason for a room move. Her reason: ""DUMBASS."" In all caps. I thought maybe she was typing it out of frustration and would delete it and put something legit, but NOPE, she just hits enter and proceeds as normal. My jaw dropped. I immediately walked away and texted my manager.

Apparently while I was gone, she couldn't figure out how to give the guy his previous Extended Stay rate in his king suite. So instead of referring him to management, she just said ""Sorry, you're stuck with that new room."" He ended up checking out *twenty-four days early*.

TL;DR: Coworker is a bitch, called a guest a dumbass, and tried to tell him he was SOL instead of accommodating an easy (if stupid) request. Lost the hotel thousands of dollars. Also has a tendency to shit-talk management, which... isn't sitting well with anyone.

Management is trying to get rid of her, but she has a lot of tenure here so it's proving difficult. Oof.The Bitchy Coworker",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guy comes in 2 days ago to reserve and pay for a room for the next day, he just wanted to get it taken care of. He comes back in later that night to ask to put his stuff in the room. Manager says no, your check-in date is tomorrow. He says he won't be sleeping there, he just wants to offload his things. (???)  

Fast forward to today, same guy comes in saying that he believes we are holding a room for him. His name doesn't match the arrivals for today, so I searched his name. He had a reservation for yesterday but cancelled it. Somehow that equals ""holding a room"" for him?We don't.... hold rooms for cancelled reservations?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tonight has been an annoying night. Partially because it's been busy, and partially because I'm itching to get drinks with my dad after work.

Anyway. My shift is winding to a close, and the rumble in my tummy that only ~~hands~~ fish and chips and cider can satisfy is getting louder. When in walks a a member of the city police. At first I assume he's looking for my coworker, as I happen to know this cop, and know that he and my coworker are bros. But he's not, today it's all business. He wants to see the camera. After he makes a quick and wonderfully overdramatic check of the lobby to make sure there are no guests, he tells me:

There's a gorram stolen car in the parking lot.

*Cue flashback.*

In walks a guy who looks familiar. Hm, does he look familiar just because he's stayed before, or because he's on the DNR? He passes over his ID, and I do in fact recognize his name. He used to stay with us all the time, and he was always a fucking tool about one thing or another. Often times we will ban people for that, but apparently he managed to keep himself from being THAT much of a tool because his name wasn't on the DNR. Probably because he and my boss liked to talk motorcycles, even though my boss didn't like him as a person.

Speaking of, I notice outside instead of his usual motorcycle, a metallic orange Dodge Charger.

*Flashback ends*

The cop describes the stolen car to me. It's the metallic orange Dodge Charger. What a fucking coincidence. Further coincidence? The guy prefers first floor, but got put on the second because we're so busy. Not just any second floor room, but one with a camera literally right outside of it. It also happens to be the camera with the best view of the parking lot. I pull up that camera. Right as I do, dude's girlfriend comes out and the cop charges off.

Guess who's on the DNR now motherfucker.Years of evading the DNR list came to a dramatic conclusion",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Earlier in the week I was checking in a lady, who had stated her husband was not here yet whose name was on the reservation.

Thankfully she was written on the reservation, so that wasn’t a problem. But her husband’s credit card was used to take the deposit (room+tax), and without having it in person, we can’t keep it on that card.

So I ask this lady who had given me her card if she’d like to use this card for the room+tax and incidentals since her husbands card was on file, and she said “No, just leave it on his card.” I then explained to her our policy in which we couldn’t unless we were to have it in person and she almost cuts me off *loudly yelling* “WHY DID YOU EVEN ASK THEN?!” 

I look to my right to see my coworker laughing under his breath and take a breath. “I just want to be sure you’re okay with using your card instead” 
“Oh, okay.” Random unneeded outburst I guess.

I continue with the checkin and give her the keys  to her room. She then comes back almost immediately asking for a room with more of a view as hers faced our courtyard. I let her know our hotel doesn’t really have good views (as it states and shows online), but I could give her an outward facing room if she’d like. I show her the room first so I don’t waste her time and she goes “Oh, so it’s a view of the *parking lot*...” 
I repeat exactly what I said before about views and she shrugs it off and says she’ll take that room.

10 min later she comes back to the desk saying she wants to use one of our bikes, so I give her the waiver and send her to valet. Not even 5 min later she comes back saying “I left the bike out there because there was NO ONE at valet. The brakes were really bad so I didn’t even bother.”

Mind you, they are cruiser bikes to use on the flat path by the beach and can brake by single-gear reverse pedal. I walked out as soon as she went by the desk and our valet attendant was right outside putting the bike away... she must not have even waited 15 seconds.

I talked with the valet attendant and he said she first tried to take *someone else’s* bike parked at our rack, and when she was told it was a guest’s, she said “Do you think he’ll notice?”

I just couldn’t stop laughing at this chick. She did some other shenanigans but in the end I just wonder how these people affect others around themSometimes you have to laugh at the complete assholes",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I wasn't working the shift it happened, but that afternoon I got the whole story about his ""checkout""

Backstory:
He stayed with us for about two weeks. Quiet guy, didn't really leave his room aside from to stop housekeepers in the hall for fresh towels and to request no service to his room from time to time. He had food and alcohol delivered to him so we didn't really see him at the desk. You know, the usual *just wants his privacy* kinda guy. 

Finally, housekeeping decided his room absolutely needed to be cleaned due to a smell in the hallway near him. (We thought maybe someone tracked in dog poo because we had some in house) **also** because he hadn't had service in so long. GM called his room and explained that we needed to change out his sheets etc in the morning and if he wanted we could change his room if he didn't want to be bothered. He says okay.

My relief comes in. Full of hope for her usual quiet 8 hour shift. Then he calls. He's checking out. She gets his bill ready for him and notices a car pull up outside the exit near his room and sees him get into it and leave. 
I don't know what made her want to check his room, but she did.

Vomit. Feces. Everywhere.
They found about 300 empty alcohol cans, a clogged toilet, sink and tub drain. Feces smeared **EVERYWHERE**, tile in the bathroom, the carpet, parts of the bed. It was a mess. It looked like he had tried to clean it up with our towels. 

Thankfully he had a credit card on file that had a very generous $700 fee charged to in damages.There's WHAT everywhere?!?!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"  This happened about a half hour ago now but I can't stop thinking about it and I really shouldn't be bothered by it so I figured I'd post it. I'm sorry if it's too winded, TLDR at bottom.

  So, I work Night Audit at a hotel that is affiliated with an international company that we'll call Peschi. 
The hotel I work at is a smaller branch of said company but the area I work in has 7+ hotels that are also affiliated with Peschi, including a really swanky downtown property that my partner happens to work at and a few properties across town.

  I'm new to the hotel industry; I've only been working a couple months on night shift and I'm not great at confrontation but I have a decent understanding of the basics so far.

  So I'm 2 hours into my shift, it's just past midnight when a guy walks in, phone out. He says he was trying to book a room online but it's now after midnight and the site had stopped working. He says he books online all the time, his whole family works for Peschi so he knows how the site should work. I thought it was odd that he said there was a problem when he had just stated the cut off time, but I offered him to use our computers in the lobby, as maybe he was trying to book for next day.  Then his phone rang and he took a call. I was going to wait for him to end his call but he began pulling his cards and ID out and setting them on the desk so I began booking a room for him on my terminal. Before I ran his card, I ran over the details for his stay and checked that he was okay with the price ( about 115) He was not. 

  He told his call to hold, put it on speaker, then began insisting he had booked online but it had stopped working and he should have a room booked for $83.93. Which might have been true, however the site stops working at midnight and will only book for the next day. I assume he was cut off before actually reserving and I began to explain why the site wasn't working and he cut me off saying he was aware, his whole family works for Peschi, so he knows how it works. Yet, he still insisted on the original price and began telling me to call the 1-800 number, because since the site had stopped working while he was using it he should get the pricing, which the call wouldn't have helped either as the site again stops working at midnight to reset for the next day. No exceptions. 

  I decided to try to descalate the situation and call my manager, who again correlated No. Online pricings can only be booked online as they offer other promotions we don't offer in the hotel. So I make my way to the front and once again begin to explain "" My apologies sir, but the online prices are only offered online as they offer other promotions that we do not offer in the hotel-"" 

  He cuts me off again, saying he knows, as his whole family, including him now, works for the company but is still insisting he be given the online price because the site stopped working. At midnight. His call, who was still on speaker listening, tells him to ask for a manager. So he asks for a manager, who I tell him is in at 9 tomorrow morning. He asks who I was on the phone with, then insists I call my manager back and tell him to come in to talk to him.
  At this point I figure this guy is either trying to scam me or is trying to scare me into giving him a room and I'm not having it. I tell him no and said I was sorry but if he worked for the company, he should know the online cut off was midnight and if he was not happy with the prices he could go somewhere else. He and his call begin yelling at me and I began giving him other property options to which he threw his card at me, and told me he doesn't need other options, he has a Platnium card. (Ohhhh MY mistake your Highness) 
  I pick it up from the floor and slid it back to him and tell him I'm sorry but your card isn't good here. He starts yelling again and tells me I'm a dumb, stupid bitch (noice) and he knows I'm a stupid bitch because I work for Peschi. 

""Yes I do. Like your whole family,""

  Y'all I have never seen someone step in their own shit and get so mad about it. He goes white and starts yelling again, calling me obscenities, accuses me of being discriminatory then calls me a dumb white bitch, ( I'm Mexican but ok) then yells something about minimum wage and suing and walks out, adding I'd better hope he doesn't come back. 

  Again, I'm bad at confrontation and I get the shakes after a bit, so once my jitters go down, I take out my binder with all of the numbers of the surrounding properties and call him in. Since I had began making a Folio for him I still had his full name and address, along with a car make that I got from my camera block. They all agree to a DNR and, since my guy had a Platnium card, I called my partners swanky property in case he decided to drive further and he was put on a DNR list to all hotels in my area and at the ones across town. (Schnoogens)

  I'm not bothered by the yelling. I get shitty attitudes all the time along with all kinds of entitlement. Everyone has a Platnium card when they think it'll get them somewhere. 

  My thing is, of all the scams to try to use, you thought going with ""my whole family works at Peschi"" would work?  Vato I was born at night but not last night, if you work here you know the cut off for online booking- and bullshit - is midnight.


  TLDR: Guy comes in to get online pricing for same day after midnight. Gets told no and gets mad and he calls his whole family stupid.

UPDATE: He came back. I'll post a seperate update.The cut off is Midnight, no execptions.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"One of my coworkers, who is technically a manager as far as corporate is concerned, had an old friend of the family that had become an alcoholic. He and HIS friend needed a place to stay, so they each got a room. Despite being raging alcoholics they had money, and their cards were always good.

This little story is about the friend of the friend of my coworker.

He would always be drunk, go to his friend's room and forget to take his key, so he would come to the front desk to get one.

One night I'm sitting in the lobby at 1 or 2 AM watching Star Trek. I hear the door chime go off, hop up, and turn around to see Mr. Drinky standing there BUTT BALLS NAKED. The dude was not into manscaping, let me tell you.  He is absolutely hammered, and has taken on a primitive childlike disposition.

Drinky:   I need a key. I locked myself out.

Me: Why are you naked, sir!?!?!

Drinky: I need a key, please. I got locked out.

I went over to the front desk and made him a key 

Me: Next time be wearing some clothes, OK? I don't need naked dudes in my lobby.

Drinky: Thank you for the key.

I don't think a word I said got through to him. As he turned around and left. He had a big red mark on each ass cheek. He looked like a damn baboon. The next day my coworker told me his ass was like that because a few days prior while taking a piss, he was so drunk he fell into the tub.

Back before Christmas I mentioned the incident again to my coworker, and she informed me that he had recently drunk himself to death.

The end.

"Howdy and haylo my fellow shift monkeys! Tonight I bring you a tale of woe and cowardice, to make your spine shutter and my knee weak. So sit down, gentle readers, and avail yourself of my tale.

Two nights ago, standing at my spot in the lobby, mostly surfing reddit, mostly trying to appear busy and professional. Probably failing one or the other, only the fates can decide that. Regardless, as I stand there, I spy a fuzzy little dude hop out from behind our coffee machine and run straight to our rear lobby door. Once he arrives he begins jumping up and down, as though trying to trigger the door.

Somewhat surprised, I tried to trigger the door with a broom so he would run out. Not. Happening. He bolts off somewhere and the chase is on. I lose him under some furniture but I won't be defeated. This is my turf fleabag, and I know you haven't paid your room and board. Bear in mind, I had no desire to kill him merely move him outside so he can return to his normally scheduled ratly duties. 

So, picture me, running back and forth through the lobby at roughly 3 in the morning chasing a rat with a broom. Yes, very mid 1940's, I know. My favorite moment was when a random Lyft driver stopped in to use the bathroom and found me sweeping up ... nothing. I'm sure he noticed the huge pile of nothing, but chose to continue on to his relief. 

I lost him again at this point though I suspect he had taken refuge under our lobby phone booth. It is just for show, imagine an all wood booth like you'd see (again) in the 40's. Nothing to do at this point but wait. I can't leave anything out to try to control his path since the lobby is about to start kicking. I just have to hope like hell he either stays hidden or comes out again before 5 am hits.

He did! This time he runs right to the front lobby entrance and again starts hopping up and down. I had lucked out as this door isn't a giant POS and the control for it is right next to my PC. I open the door and the little guy scurries away into the night to do ... whatever the hell it is rats do when not running about in my lobby. 

After the fireworks, I peek behind the coffee area to discover a roughly 4 inch diameter hole in the wall, complete with rat droppings under it. I write up a small note for my bosses to have Orkin come earlier than usual and finish out the night. I purposefully did not tell my relief as he is a notorious gossip. 

Fast forward to tonight. We have instructions to be on the look-out for any potential areas they could be, but assurances that the traps are all re-baited, ingress and egress points have been sprayed, etc. etc. et. al. Cool beans, on with the show. Do a few property walks, run the audit, typical night. 

Now comes the cowardice. Listen, I am not a large guy by any means, but I am also not afraid of jack and/or shit. Having worked my fair share of notells, people just do not frighten me. Well, minus Mike Tyson, for obvious reasons. Getting back on point, I had just finished a property walk and was settling in for the next hour or so before the next. I (stupidly) set the flashlight that I carry on a little cubby that was just slightly too short for it to fit into so I have to sort of wedge it between the shelf and the bottom of the counter. It hangs, perfectly. 

Or so I thought.

About an hour after this, I am standing in front of said cubbies putting together key packets. It is at this time that my haphazardly hung flashlight gives up the ghost and falls. Out of the corner of my eye I just see movement, and hear what can only be described as scurrying. 

Y'all, I jumped roughly 2 feet straight up. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but I can't. I've even rewatched the tape and I'm fairly certain my feet were just shy of the top of the counter by about 6 inches. On the way up though? Well, I full force 5000 kneed the marble countertop. I dropped instantly and curled up in an assball and tried my damndest to stifle the string of expletives flooding my mind.  

My only saving grace during this? The fact that the audio wasn't set to record and my bosses don't get to hear me shriek like a 5 year old at a flashlight ... God my knee hurts ...

Also gotta love the various, jilted lover, is John Doe there in the building and if he is can I talk to him and have his room number. No I can't? So let me scream at you until you hang up on me. 

And don't forget the, hey I'm an employee of *\*insert brand name hotel here\** and I get an employee discount. So give me that rate during the reservation.

"Formalities out of the way: Long time lurker, first time poster (wouldn’t let me make a spam account to post this, goodbye anonymous protections! apologies for formatting, doing this on a phone.)

So, I work for a private club that has boutique style overnight rooms available. In slower times, we find ourselves having to use the monster that is Booking to boost numbers. As such, this is where our main antagonist comes into play. (JB, we’ll call him.)

Back in December, JB books his stay with us. Fills out all his stuff at sign in, typical nonsense for a 3 day guest. On the afternoon of the second day, we catch JB smoking in his room (we have a strict non-smoking policy in rooms.) My manager confronted him, charges him $250 onto his bill for said offense, and he signs his receipt. 

The next week, he leaves a scathing review on Booking, claiming he was judged because the desk agent had the nerve to mention our dress code (Private club, a dress code is to be expected and is noted at check in for being business casual.) In addition, complains that the room smells like cigarette smoke (gee, I wonder why...) and that our amenities are not up to standard (subjective opinion)

Fast forward to January, he files a charge back with his card company, on the grounds that he didn’t stay at our establishment. In counter response, we submit all the paperwork (his registration card, his signed receipt with the smoking fee on it, and a screenshot of his review.) Figured this would be an easy rejection.

Today, I just found out from my controller that JB won the fucking chargeback case...  HOW THE FUCK IS THIS POSSIBLE.

"When I first started at a hotel 8 years ago, I was a shy, young lady. I smiled and was super friendly to all guests. I was unaware of all the horrible, entitled guests and loved interacting with everyone. Including this older man who was a regular. He would check in, go to his room, come back down to the bar &amp; would stop by the fd to talk to me. 

He started bringing me gifts here &amp; there. Chocolates, little trinkets, flowers. He would say it was from the office &amp; he didnt want it or there were flowers leftover from a meeting &amp; he thought I might like them. My supervisor told me to be wary of him &amp; his intentions. I just thought he was a friendly older man. He then started complimenting me and telling me how much he liked me. It got awkward. I was always friendly- as I was to all other guests!- and I never considered it flirting. I was being hospitable. 

I started to work the audit shift a few months after starting &amp; that's when he would come down in the middle of the night to see me. I I didn't know how to be nice while telling him to leave me alone because he was pushing the creeper status. He started to ask me out on dates. I told him I was dating. He said it was ok, as long as I wasn't married, I was single. I told him it was against policy. He told me he would ask my manager to ok it. 

Looking back at that young, naive girl, I wish I had just told him straight up I wasn't interested and to please leave me alone and keep it professional. I didn't know how to be assertive back then. Thankfully 8 years in this business, I have learned how to stand up for myself. 

I started looking for his reservations &amp; when he was in house, I would hide in the back office all night. I literally hid from the man instead of telling him to leave me alone. 

He did go to my supervisor to ask about the dating policy and she told him I couldn't go out with him, even to dinner as friends. He asked where I was, if I still worked there because he hadn't seen me in a while. He actually stopped staying at our hotel which was weird because he was a regular for a few years.

He was a nice guy &amp; maybe he would have been cool if I had been straight up but I was so non-confrontational back then. A people pleaser. I didnt want to hurt anyone's feelings. Especially a top tiered regular (LOL how times have changed). I love when guests are thoughtful and give the hotel employees little gifts here &amp; there but now I am wary about excepting gifts from men if it isn't for the entire staff.

"Everything would have been fine.

Two things to note about our hotel policy: 
1. To help against fraud, we keep rooms vacant/clean instead of vacant/ready &amp; change it when the guest arrives &amp; shows ID.
2. If we are sold out, we precheck all guests in before audit. If we aren't, we let them go to No Show (if they are one-nighters)

I usually run audit around 3-330am. I'll wait as long as I can especially if I have guests who still havent arrived. This night (#1) I decided to run it around 230am, with two guests left to check in. I check one in (4 night stay) and let the other go to NS. 

Audit is almost complete, it is just about to print the reports so probably 10-15 minutes left. In walks a guest at 2:50am. The one nighter- the one that went to NS. Since audit is basically done, the system has already posted &amp; charged his cc for the night. Guest tells me he has actually been here for hours- he fell asleep in our parking lot. (#2) 

I have two computers that I work on at the FD to be more efficient and one computer is running audit so I check him in on the other one. Because audit hasn't finished, it hasn't changed the business date &amp; I can put him for the original dates instead of 0 nights as I would do after audit completed. I change his rate to $0 &amp; transfer the charges from his NS reservation so I dont have to refund &amp; recharge him. He goes to his room. 

I forgot to change the room to v/r before I checked him in (#3) and was about to do it when the other computer starts printing my reports &amp; tells me to change the tapes for next business day. So I do it. (#4) I remember that I have to go back and switch the room status &amp; finish checking him in when my computer stops working. 

Apparently, there was an unexpected server reboot to happen as soon as I changed the tapes. (#5) I had to wait an hour for it to finish but by the time it did (4:00a), it switched both computer's business dates. I try to finish checking him in but it says I cant check in after arrival date. I try a few things before i decide to contact help services thru chat. 

I spent 430-545am with them &amp; they could not help me. They kept asking me to log in to a program I dont have access to (#6), asking me to have a manager do it, after I repeatedly told them I was alone &amp; a manager wouldn't get there for at least 3 hours. They kept telling me to hold on so they could discuss it with their team. 

I leave at 6am. I havent done most of the things I have to do after audit and I usually leave alot because I always have the time. I'm completely over it by now. Ready for the week to be over and it's only ... what? F! Tuesday. 

They finally get back to me, tell me to try checking the guest in, one last time, (didn't work) and then told me to try again in an hour. If it doesn't work then, to call them back but in the meantime, they would label the ticket as *resolved*!! 

I was able to get everything done (except the pending guest) but didnt clock out until 630a. I apologized to the morning FDA, explained everything and wished her luck. I called back shortly after 715a, when our DOS would be in &amp; I know she has access to the program I didnt.

"I'm sure that by now a Shining reference is a tired trope among hotel employees, especially for us NA employees. I've only ever worked at two hotels, and one of them was part of the university I went to (a relatively cozy campus job), the other, that I currently work at, is an extended stay chain. The extended stay chain is easily the slowest hotel of the two, so thankfully that lends itself for a lot of lax NA shifts. Just remember to bring a book, because it gets *slow.* We're also a rare hotel that still delivers paper folios under the door, but recently we're trying to phase that out, because as you'd imagine it's terribly eco-unfriendly and the cost of paper adds up. Often, we're at less than 50% occupancy.

Anyway, this one night was a standard NA shift for me. When I deliver folios under the doors, I like to listen to music on my headphones and the music I like to listen to can be anything from hip hop to ambient music. I don't think I'm allowed to do this, but no one has found out so far and I'm not planning to stay at this job for very long, so I don't really care. Anyway, I'm up in the hotel hallways delivering folios under the doors, and this particular night I've decided to listen to dark ambient music (aka the music genre of scores to many a horror film). Granted, this was my fault but I didn't suspect anything weird would end up happening. It doesn't help that my headphones were noise-cancelling as well. Then all of a sudden, something behind me is tugging at my pants. I look behind me and it's a crying little girl, probably about 8 years old, all by herself. My heart practically skips ten beats. 

Clearly, she's more scared than I am, but paired with the dark ambient music I felt like a horror movie scene (a la The Shining) had suddenly came to life. She keeps telling me ""I lost my family!"". I'm confused and freaked out as hell, so I pause my music and I ask her where her room is. She has no clue, so I tell her that we're going to find her parents and I walk her down to the front desk. After some pressing, I find out her parent's last name and first name. I call their room and I hold on the line forever, like for at least 2 minutes and the parent is still answering. Mind you, our hotel phone rings are LOUD, so I start to think the parents are out of the room and I have to call the cops or something. She's behind the front desk with me because she's obviously too afraid to leave my side, and shortly after I call the parents finally come down. They come to the front desk and they ask ""Have you seen or found a little girl?"". The parents are obviously confused and concerned. I pick up the little girl and the parents claim their child, very relieved.

According to the parents, the little girl was sleeping in the bed with them and must've left the room on her own without the parents knowing, but they said they have no idea how that could've happened or how the little girl could have lost them when they were in the same hotel room the entire time. The parents were apparently just very deep sleepers.A Night Audit Shift Out of The Shining",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I'm a Front Desk Agent, and I am ***UNBELIEVABLY*** frustrated at my manager because of how she treated an interaction with a guest... I've never posted here, but I figured ""*hey, maybe I'll get some sympathy-karma*"", and I want to bitch and complain... so here's the tale I call ""*The Manager that Never Followed Through On Her Threats*""

It all started particularly normally. It's a decently busy night at the \[*insert brand here*\],  I'm the only Front Desk Agent on duty but my Manager is popping on to help when it gets busy. We just had a rush of people so she had popped on to help cut the line down and was just finishing things on her end when ***He*** walked in

You ever just *know* that someone's gonna be a problem? This was that, perfectly encapsulated. It was an older couple, but the woman immediately sat down while he approached the desk. I give him the standard greeting, all smiles and pep, and his response is ""My name is \[*insert name here*\], *I am a Top-Tier-Extra-Shiny-and-Special Member with* \[brand name\]*, are there any free upgrades available*""

The way he said it got across that he wasn't *asking*, he was *telling* me that he wanted a free upgrade... great start

But you know what, whatever. It's not that busy, he's a Cubic-Zirconium, no skin off my back if I give him a pair of slippers and a robe to keep him happy

""*let me see if we have anything available!*"", I say as I begin looking to see if we have any decent views. But I barely get a chance to even look before he pipes up with his next demand

""*How does the parking work?*""

… ahh... the parking... Somehow, I *knew* that this was going to be the straw that broke the camel's back

Our parking is... unique... we are at a downtown location, so there is a small fee (all the other hotels in the area have similar fees, and ours is actually a dollar or two cheaper than some of our competitors) for parking. The parking garage we use is technically owned by the city, and we just rent a certain amount of spaces from them, so there is really not any negotiation about parking; we charge because we get charged for it, end of story.

""*The parking is directly behind us, it's come and go as you please, it's all by your license plate, there is a small fee of\~""*

""*WHEN I BOOKED, I* ***SPECIFICALLY*** *CHECKED IF THE PARKING IS FREE*. *I* ***NEVER*** *PAY FOR PARKING, AND IT TOLD ME ON THE APP THAT IT'S FREE!""*

I *immediately* know that's wrong. We get people complaining about paying for parking all the time, you'd almost believe that we were *really* the only hotel in the world that has the ***AUDACITY*** to charge for parking, so I know for a fact that everywhere you can book; from the reservation line, to the app, to online reservation vendors, ***NONE*** of them say ""*free parking*"". We dealt with all those ***YEARS*** ago

I pipe up with something along the lines of ""*I apologize for the confusion sir, but there is a small charge for parking. If you can show me where it says we have free parking, I might be able to do something about it*"", I say, knowing full well that it doesn't say there's free parking. But he digs his phone out, and after a second or two of scrolling he shoves it in my face where I read this message

&gt;*Parking is available at* \[location\] *across the street. Please make sure to stop by the front desk to give your license plate to avoid additional fees*

He must have seen ""*Parking is available*"" and read it as ""*Parking is* ***ABSOLUTELY*** ***FREE BABYYYYYYYY WOOOOOOOOOO!***"", but nowhere on here does have the word ""*free*""... so that's what I tell him!

""*I apologize for the confusion, but the message says parking is* ***available***\*, and you need to give us your plate in order to avoid getting a parking ticket\*"" (Like I said, it's city parking, they'll ticket your ass in 10 seconds flat if you're not in our system)

Up to this point I've been trying to use direct quotes, or at least semi-accurate paraphrases, but I don't exactly remember what happened next because he went into a tirade and started ranting about how he ***NEVER*** pays for parking, and threatening to leave and go somewhere else, and *blahblahblahblahwahwahwah*. This is also the point where my manager steps in

They went back and forth for a while with my manager playing *hard* damage control and *Douchey Guest* continuing to threaten to raze hell over 12$, all coalescing into him grabbing his stuff and walking out... at which point my manager says ""*\~If you leave now we'll have to charge you for a late cancellation*""

He comes back, asks her for her name, demands to have her business card and the business card of the general manager, and he says ""*If you charge me for this* ***bullshit***, there will be ***HELL*** *to pay*"", before he stomps out, his wife quietly behind in tow.

At this point, I've already written up the notes on the reservation that the guest was informed that there would be charges and not to waive the cancellation fee. I am 100% prepared to charge this asshole; he was *clearly* wrong at every step, and he tried to threaten and bully his way to free parking and a waived fee. My manager steps out back to write up a Guest Incident report in case he tries to escalate this with the brand. I am feeling *good* about the situation

And then my manager comes up and tells me that me that 1. If he comes back, we are to offer him free parking, and 2. She has set up the reservation to waive the late cancel fee

***WHAT***

***THE FUCK***

I'll admit here, I was looking forward to charging him. I wanted him to throw a stink, and waste his time and energy ranting and raving with a furiosity that would make the little spat here pale in comparison. I ***HATE*** bullies, and dude was blatantly and obviously bullying his way through the world. This was sweet, well deserved, and ***totally compliant with our operating standards and procedures*** revenge. And I am ***flabbergasted*** that she's willing to forgo it

I even called her out on it, I directly asked why we were doing this. And she said ""*because it's not worth the trouble, and I'm the manager*""

Like, yeah, you *are* the manager, and what you say goes, but ***WHY***??? Why are we making an exception here for this trio of goblins stapled together in the rough shape of a person when we are **CLEARLY** in the right? I have the ***strangest*** feeling that if this happened when she *wasn't* here, and I waived the late cancel fee and offered free parking, I'd be getting a stern talking to by *her* the next day

But the fact that she's a manager means she just has different rules to play by I guess

So there, that's my rant/story. Does anyone else have stuff like this happen to them? Am I crazy here by trying to hold him accountable for his douchey actions? This isn't the first time I've felt like this about my managers actions before, but it's certainly the most egregious event of this nature I've experienced since I started

"This has been a trend every since I worked here.

So we have a designated smoking area, and we used to have this generic cigarette bud holder that you could just screw the top off and empty out the dirty cig butts. Well since we had so many homeless people coming into our parking garage and dumping out cigarette butts just to find the ones that were only half smoked or whatever. We bout a higher end cig butt catcher. It has a lock on it so (you would think) that no one could get access to the cigarette buds, which would lead to no more mess. But we should of known that homeless people are so tact and resourcefulness. SO now every two weeks are so some homeless person literally smashes the cigarette catcher against the concrete until it opens. Leaving THE BIGGEST MESS. I'm pissed because now I have to go outside with a broom and dust pan because guest report there is a HUGE MESS in the smoking area.

I feel bad for our chief engineer because he was so proud of this new cig catcher and this will be the 3rd or 4th time he has had to ""fix it""....  I'm so glad I don't have to tell him the bad news because I feel like he is going to be PISSED

Edited for clarity:

&amp;#x200B;

1. We sent security up with reports of disability assistance guests to assist them.

2. The hotel MAY have generators. I should have stated this is a new location to me, and I handled it the best way I could.

3. The only people caught in the elevator were entitled smucks. We even called the elevator phone to see who was in there.

So yeah, craaaazy winds the other night. We have many floors... We advise guests to please report to 1st floor, do not use the elevator.

"This happened a while ago, but I felt inspired by some of the free cancellation posts on here tonight. We had a guest call us because she wanted to cancel her room that night free of charge due to her partner being sick.

We then get a call from someone at Fecking.com asking if we’d allow *the same guest*  to cancel free of charge because her nephew got into a car accident and was in hospital.

 I'm actually going to miss him. He said he's going to stop by the next time he's in town and I really hope he does, it's not that often a guest will keep you company in the wee hours of the morning, to help time fly and actually enjoy it.1 in a million",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"Backstory: Working at a smallish 120 room hotel in the Midwest. The year was 1995-1996, so way before cell phones, etc. My GM was a no-nonsense person who would tell a guest to not let the door hit them in the rear if a guest was disrespectful to staff.

Sisters Hotels GM and Night auditor

My GM, Old Auditor and Me

Story:

My GM came in one morning and there was a note in his box. He reads this note and shakes his head and tells me some people are too stupid to even exist then throws the note in the garbage. I ask him what’s going on? GM asked if anyone ever tell me about the guy I replaced? I tell him no, he explains one night a woman was trying to get ahold of her husband staying at our hotel for over an hour. There was no answer to the phone. She called our sister hotel right next door to find out why our hotel was not picking up the phone. The night auditor at the other hotel tried for about 15 min repeatedly calling the hotel with no answer. The auditor calls his GM that lives on the property and explains the situation. The other GM walks over and looks around the front desk area, but no one is around so he calls up to my hotels GM apartment and wakes him up. They both look around the hotel checking several locations without finding him. Finally, my GM checks the rooms on maintenance and find this auditor passed out DRUNK. My GM tells me he walks over in a rage and flips the bed over on top of the old auditor. My GM tells me it took 45 min to convince the guy he was fired. The old Auditor’s defense “I Didn’t know I was not allowed to drink on the job!”

The note the GM had just read was from this guy ask for an employee discount on a room because he had family coming into town and wanted to get the employee discount on the room rental.GM must repeatedly tell a night auditor he is fired",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"7-3 shift, just got in, I was printing off reports, sipping coffee, I am exhausted due to throwing up a good portion of my night, I am not in the mood for ANYBODY. But, this man tried me. 

This man walked up and handed me the water stopper in the shower, that is connected to the tub I will add, you need a screwdriver to take it off, I just kinda looked at him and said, ""what is this?"" 

Him: this broke off.

Me:.....alright then I will get my maintenance man to put this back on. 

Him: I had to really work to get it off by the way

Me: so you broke it off?

Him: well yes but I didn't, it was already broken. 

Me:........I will get my maintenance man to fix it

Him: I think somebody knew I was coming and purposely did this to my room.

Me:...........................wa....what 

Him: well the first room I had last night was way too hot, somebody purposely put it on the highest setting! They knew I would be in that room and went in there and did that! 

It is cold up where I am, the hotel rooms get cold too, SUPER COLD, especially if nobody goes in there for a few days, so we turn the heaters on low, like the lowest setting, to keep it going in the room. Well, we have some rooms that like to kick on to full heat in the room, like BLAST the heat on their own, especially if it senses the room is too cold. This is what happened in this situation, it automatically kicked on. 

Me: Sir, I do not believe that anybody purposely did any of that to the room. I also don't think housekeeping knows about who you are, because they clean the room, not work on the computers at the desk?

Him: then explain the plug!

Me: how would anybody know you were going to change rooms from the first room to that room? 

Him: I just think somebody is messing with me now! This is ridiculous, I want to speak to the housekeepers that worked on those rooms yesterday and ask what they have against me!

Me: I can't allow that, all of these things are accidents that can easily be fixed, however, it looks like my  plug has been stripped sir. 

Him: I didn't do it

Me:.............................................................In that case, was there anything else wrong with the room?

Him: no. Am I getting my stay comped?!

"So, as if to balance out the bad I already had. This sweet older gentleman came into the lobby and informed me of a truck backed into the parking lot, asked if I had known about it, I didn't. And he explained that it had been there when he had come back, about 25 minutes before I came on shift, at least 2 people, lights off, drinking beer, looked shady from how he described it. I told him I'd investigate. This guy, already informing me of a potential safety issue, went even further and insisted I call him if anything happened. It was so sweet, I just have a soft place in my heart for guests that actually give a shit about my safety. BUT ANYWAYS! I go to investigate out of one of the side doors facing that part of the parking lot. And lo and behold, it was there, backed in, beige, lights off. At the time I didn't know the color, so I called the man to confirm it. This guy declares that he's going to check it out for himself. He comes back and tells me it's empty, so crisis averted, we joke and he goes back to his room, but that really did make up for the other guy having an attitude with me from the get go. So, to that guest who went above and beyond what you needed to do, thank you, you gave me a good smile.

"So I started my shift and it got off to a rocky start. Guy comes in wanting a room. He asks for two beds and I oblige, I need to get the amount of people that are in that room, naturally, so I ask him how many people, he doesn't respond, I ask again and he doesn't respond. I ask if it's just him and he just blows up ""why would I want two beds if I'm by myself, do YOU sleep in two beds?!"" I'm already getting annoyed at this. I don't respond, and continue on. He hands me ID and I get to work. He asks me if He can pay in cash, I say at checkout. He hands me a card and it declines, I do it again and it declines, of course he says it's the machine's fault, I don't poke at it, not really that worth it. He pulls up his account and goes on about how we've charged him twice, this makes no sense, I haven't even checked him in yet and his card isn't authorized for us to charge him, I explain that we don't charge until he checks out, if I can't get him checked in, it doesn't go through. He insults my reading skills and I'm just hoping the last time I run it, it declines, god wasn't so favorable and it finally approved. But he's out of my hair.

Oh, he also blamed his bad attitude on lack of sleep, he said it was because he got only three. BUDDY, I sometimes have to deal with people like you on NO sleep! That's not an excuse to get pissy at me.Already so done tonight.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I came into the hotel this morning and saw chunks of glass scattered throughout the lobby. WTF happened on a MONDAY night in March?! 

FIRST drunk guest stumbled into the lobby around 3:00 AM and was being disruptive, so our night auditor (who is about 3 weeks new to our team) diffused the situation and kept them from disturbing our other guests. Eventually, drunk guest was ready to go to their room and our night auditor escorted them up. Drunk guest couldn’t find the room key, so they came back down to the lobby to make a new one.

When they got back down to the lobby, a SECOND drunk guest and partner were pounding on the lobby doors because they were locked out. Night auditor let them in and couldn’t find their reservation (later, we found out they were booked at a different Shmoliday Bin across town...OF FREAKING COURSE). 

Drunk guest #2 started arguing with our night auditor, cussed him out, shouted racial slurs, and punched our poor night auditor. THEN, Drunk guest #1 freaked out, threw a glass-top coffee table across the lobby, picked up large shards, and proceeded to throw them. That’s when the police arrived and arrested drunk guest #2, but guest #1 ran off with no coat and no shoes. Never thought anything like this would happen at our hotel, especially on a Monday night.Drunk guests wreak havoc on a Monday night...WTF?! 2 completely separate drunkies collided around our new night auditor.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey everyone! Tonight is my second to last shift at my hotel before i take a sabbatical for 6 months to travel a bit so i thought i'd share a story I've been sitting on for maybe 2 years, unsure of if i should share it.

So anyways, here's the story of how we most likely had an american spy in our hotel in Iceland.

So about two years ago an american man comes and checks in, seems normal, no fuss, stay is for like 3 or 4 days. The first night we notice he's a bit of a talker (when drunk at least) and was talking to myself and my colleague around 3 or 4 at night about how he's traveled all over the world, he mentions that he's been in North Korea 16 times. My colleague asks him why he's been there so many times and responds with ""Uuuuh because my mother's a wh\*re"" ...... alright...

Next night he comes back, a bit drunk again but wounded, bruised and bleeding from his face and explains that he was attacked outside a bar while he was just smoking ""I enjoy a skirmish every now and then but the guy just sucker punched me!"" ..... hmm alright, here's some bandages and antiseptic from our first aid kit, off to bed he goes.

I then finish my week and I'm off but I hear later that the next night my other colleagues saw him come in very drunk close to 4 am. A little bit later one of my colleagues goes for the regular security walk around the building to make sure everything is OK and finds the man passed out drunk on the 4th floor, she requests the assistance of the other night auditor to try and help him to his room.

After some poking he wakes up slightly but he cannot remember his room number, fine, that happens, they ask him for his name in order to look up his room number in the system, aaand he doesn't remember. He does not remember his own name....

After a couple of minutes of poking him awake over and over they finally get his name and with it look up his room number. He can't walk, they have to physically drag him into his room and lay him down on the bed where he instantly passes out again. As they turn around to leave they notice that on the table in the room there are 5 different passports, all of different nationalities and different names, all have his photo. A stack of Dollar bills, a stack of British pounds and a stack of Euros. As well as an american concealed carry weapons license under his american passport name that was on the reservation. (perhaps prying was a bit unethical but it was just too peculiar seeing all this on the table). 

There are no more incidents until he leaves as far as i can remember.

So this guy was either some sort of criminal or the worlds worst spy. I say worst spy because, well:

1. Let's it slip that he's been to North Korea many times and has a terrible excuse for it
2. comes in bruised and bloody after a night out
3. leaves fake passports and stacks of cash on the table when there is a safe in the room
4. Gets so drunk he forgets which cover he's using.

So yeah, i'm not sure what exactly he was but a terrible spy is my guess, no idea what he was doing in Iceland though.The international spy",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is going to be a bit long, I apologize in advance. There's a tl;dr right after the introduction. English is my first language and I'm on a computer so any errors are my own.

N= my coworker, J=her sister

I've been dealing with a coworker, N, who acts like I murdered her entire family and her dogs for about a month and a half now.  Friends I've talked to have encouraged me to go to HR but I've been hesitating.  Yesterday, my GM pulled me into his office to get my side of the story again.  He took statements from my coworker and her sister and he's taking it to HR himself because my coworker can't stand me.  I spent yesterday and today working on my statement and honestly, I'm stressed!  It's nerve-wracking! I love my job here and don't want to lose it!  Any advice would be welcome.

To make matters worse, N and her family have been living at the hotel since the end of December. All 12 of them over 2 rooms (our double queen rooms sleep 6 so it's not so bad).  So I haven't had a moment's peace. They moved in before she was hired. They haven't even paid since the second week of January so their bill is astronomical.  I don't know why or how my GM is letting them get away with it but he won't tell me a thing.

TL;DR: My coworker has made work a living hell for me because I told her what the housekeepers told me to tell her.

This is the statement I typed up, with names and locations changed.

N started working at the hotel early in January and we got along well from the get go. At least I thought we did. She learned the system very quickly and did well with the guests. Her family was frequently in the lobby so I got to know them all pretty well. N even tried to set me up with her sister, J, because she thought we would get along very well ~~(and it's hard finding other lesbians in a new state)~~. \[In the actual statement I said N wanted me to befriend J. I'm not about to out her, or myself, without permission!\] They were mostly well behaved but I had to ask N to talk to them about a couple minor things, like horsing around in the parking lot in the car because I was worried they might accidentally bump someone; or if another guest had complained about something, like the one adult son using the Mac computer in the business center to play games for hours. I tried to do it as respectfully as possible since I liked them and they were paying guests as well. In the case of the computer, I told him that it was okay for him to use the computer anytime but asked if he could limit his time to a few hours at a time if other people wanted to use it. I think the computer itself has a timer that only goes to 3 hours anyway before automatically logging out the user. I would do the same thing for any guest complaint so all the guests can enjoy their stay here.

On January 21st, I was working a morning shift when the head housekeeper came to the desk in a tizzy, saying that the housekeepers were throwing a fit about a pair of rooms having too much trash, demanding sheets be changed every day, and being too bad to clean every day as a light clean. I quickly wrote down in the book what she said then asked what rooms she was talking about. I was surprised when she said N's rooms. I wasn’t sure what to believe but we’ve had problems with extended stay rooms with a lot of people in the past. We’ve had a few unfortunate situations where the families caused so much damage that the rooms had to be put out of service for up to a month. One room was out of order for even longer and still smells faintly of wet dog when it rains. In those situations, I tried to stand up for the family and ended up in more trouble because of it.

I asked N to come down whenever she had a chance and when she, did I cautiously explained what the head housekeeper had told me and that the housekeepers wanted them to bring their trash bags down themselves. Our sales manager, who I adore, was at the desk when this happened and she chimed in that it made no sense. She had seen the rooms and they weren’t that bad. The housekeepers were just being dramatic. I said “Oh! Okay! Nevermind then. Sorry!” and thought that was the end of it. I had never seen the rooms so I had no way of knowing. I was just passing on what housekeeping had told me thinking that, as a coworker, she would understand the misunderstanding.

I didn’t think anything of it until J, N’s sister, was heading to work one evening. I wished her a good night and she responded with hostility. Confused, I said “I’m sorry?,” to which she replied “no you’re not.” I had no idea what she was talking about since, as far as I knew, we were friends. When I got off work, I rushed to the gas station for donuts as a peace offering then over to our sister property, where J worked night audit, hoping it would just be a quick case of popping in, finding out what was wrong, apologizing for being dumb, then on my way home. I realize now that going to her workplace was not the best idea, but in the moment, I was only thinking of her as a friend who was upset about something. When I tried to talk to her, from across the lobby because she stepped away when I tried to offer her the donuts, she accused me of harassing her family, citing the events with the car, asking her nephew to share the computer, and even saying that I had told her family they couldn’t use our grills late at night. The last one surprised me because, the night in question, I went out and lit the grill for them at 10:30pm. I even said it was fine for them to use the breakfast cart as long as they had it back by morning. She then said I had called her family filthy. I tried to insist that I had never called them filthy, I didn’t think that at all, and that all the other times were misunderstandings. She told me to get out and leave her and her family alone. I left, confused, but I was going to keep to my promise to leave them alone despite how much I liked them. I didn’t want to cause more heartache or trouble.

The GM called me into the office the next day to ask me my side of the story and admonish me for writing the housekeepers comments in the book. He said that N was absolutely insulted by it, that I had told everyone her family was dirty. N hadn’t said anything to me about it before. I felt horrible. I really like her family. They’re all nice people.  We’re supposed to document everything to pass on to later shifts and for future reference. Dates of complaints, who made complaints against whom, notes from housekeepers, etc. Everything goes into the book. The only people who see it are N, myself, and Brett, our night auditor. I had mostly written anything to keep housekeeping happy but I had never intended it as an insult.

I asked the GM what I should do, how to make it up to her in some way. He told me to leave her alone and keep my distance until she had cooled off, so that’s what I did. For the first week, I ducked away whenever she or her family walked through the lobby, hid my face, and only spoke to her family when they came to the desk. As the month went on, her family was friendly with me so I started to relax. We chatted, joked, and I helped them with whatever they needed, even bending the rules a little bit when they wanted something from the breakfast area late at night.

However, N and her sister continued to be openly hostile towards me. Even a month later, N would glare at me if I so much as tried to say a word to her. I attempted to apologize twice, once a couple days after the talk with the GM and once a few weeks later when I worked up the nerve. Other than that, really the only things I would say to her were “hello” and “is anything to pass on?” or strictly work related questions, needed for me to do my job properly. These were met with either ignoring my existence entirely, a flat “no” with rolled eyes, “get out of my face,” or just “don’t talk to me.” Most days she walks out the moment I clock in, before I can say anything. I’ve had to ask our maintenance man about anything going on!  This is still going on, over a month since I passed on housekeeping’s message.

Over a month of hostility from her has left me feeling miserable. I used to love coming into work. I’ve been at this hotel since it before it opened, I helped set up the rooms and clean up the construction debris. I see this hotel as sort of my baby and I love seeing it do well. Coming to work was exciting. Who would I meet today? Whose day could I make a little brighter? Cheesy, sure, but it was fun. I just love making people happy. Even the worst days or most abusive guests couldn’t dull how much I enjoyed doing my job. Even hockey teams were a breeze.  But now…. I dread it. I dread coming into a work place where my coworker is openly hostile towards me for a misunderstanding I’ve had days when I’ve felt physically ill at the thought of just having to say anything to her. Our staff is miniscule. There are only 3 FDAs, one of which only works one day a week, and 2 NAs.  Any drama is more deeply felt than at other jobs with larger staffs. There’s no escaping it.

I don’t want to cause her or the hotel any trouble, I just want things to go back to the way they were before when we were still friends. I don’t want to be treated like a pariah at the job I loved. Am I an asshole for being fed up with her behavior?The Angry Coworker",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Years ago, in the nineties, I was 25 and was a FOS at a DT 5 Star hotel in a Northern Canadian city. When famous performers passed through on tours, our hotel was one of two in the city they would stay at. (Just as a quick sidebar once Pink Floyd was coming to town, but our Sales department bumped them to take a group of Irish Dancers instead!)

This particular time the guest was a famous Sir Pianist with a penchant for unique eye wear. The booking resume came through the Front Office about 3 months prior to the arrival date, they needed about 30 rooms and had a number of specific requests. We gave them the top 3 floors of the hotel, leaving several rooms vacant so it was only their party on the floors. They were going to be in-house for 3 days.

Also, on the 25th floor was The Royal Suite room 2510. It was a luxuriously appointed room, that was three times the size of a normal room, and was two stories tall, with floor to ceiling windows. It connected to the Ambassador Suite that contained a Murphy bed and a corner King suite on the other side that were on the same floor and, via a sweeping circular staircase to the Ambassador Suite on the 26th floor.

The Royal Suite itself however, did not have a bed or a bedroom, when it needed a bed it was sold with one of the connecting bedrooms. It did have a dining room table for 12, and a very large sectional sofa that could seat at least a dozen people around a 50 inch projection screen TV. By rearranging the furniture, a space could be created where you could set up a small theater, or U-shape with some A/V so you could use it as a small meeting room, that was often utilized as a meeting space for smaller, but higher end, event clients.

One of the requests was that they need a full sized Grand Piano in the room. The rider had a contact for a renowned piano manufacturer on it, and I, as a former Concierge, was tasked with making it happen. I spoke with the piano guy, who was in California and made the arrangements. A Grand Piano was disassembled, trucked to the hotel, had to be unpacked to fit in the service elevators, then re-assembled in the room. Cost was no object.

The company also flew up a tiny little withered old man, who I remember as Giuseppe, but my mind may have made that up over the years, to come in and tune the piano. He had been in the business for over 40 years. Apparently after a piano has been through what this one had been through it takes multiple stages to put back in to tune. He worked on it for 3 days, 8 hrs a day, tuning by ear and with his velvet bag of well worn tuning forks.

I was Duty Manager that weekend so I was staying in the hotel and I popped down to the Front Desk to assist with the checkin. We had everything ready to go for them, named key packets, all the rooms turned down, bellmen on hand for luggage. The checkin went smoothly. I returned to my room, I had specifically booked myself in 2310, two floors under The Royal Suite, to see if I could hear the piano playing. Not because I am a fan, but to see if it was going to cause noise complaints.

I was in my room watching TV and having a few whiskies, I didn’t hear the piano at all, but Room Service did call me, all in a kerfuffle! Apparently the guest in 2510 had called with an unusual and very specific order and Room Service was stymied as to how to proceed. The Honky Cat wanted a 14 layer sandwich, only, no bread. A half inch thick slice of Mozarella, covered in sliced tomatoes, more cheese, more tomatoes, repeat until you reach 14 layers, not 12, not 16, sprinkle with Basil and drizzle with Olive Oil.

I asked the RS guy what the problem was, he said it wasn’t on the menu. I said who fucking cares, its Sir EJ! He said he didn’t know what to charge for it. I said, it’s Sir EJ, he doesn’t fucking care! We rang in $50 open food and the kitchen made, what I found out later was basically a Caprese salad in sandwich form. The RS waiter took it to his room, with some lemon tea and when he got back he called me again and was gushing that EJ was so nice and gracious and had tipped him $100, US no less. With exchange probably equivalent to his wages for 3 days back then!

Never heard a note of piano play, never heard a peep out of the rooms, nobody OD’ed, nobody trashed a hotel room or threw TV out a window. They were very well behaved guests. About 15 years later I met a woman who became my wife, who makes a delicious Caprese salad!Rocket Man!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I had been clocked in for all of ten minutes when the phone rang. I'm barely awake at the best of times, less so now. The woman on the phone is instantly yelling at me.

&gt;Phone Lady- I called and tried to book a room yesterday (Sunday), and I was told I'm on the do not rent list because of a tiny little argument I had with my boyfriend back in November that wasn't even anything. But I had a reservation for Saturday and couldn't check in because of being on the list, and y'all still charged me.

Even not awake, I was able to piece together that the timeline didn't make sense. 

&gt;Bran- I'm sorry, I don't see any reservations under your name for Saturday. What name was it reserved under?

&gt;Lady- What do you mean you don't see anything under my name? I didn't even give you my fucking name! Huh?

&gt;Bran- I'm-

&gt;Lady- I didn't give you my fucking name! I want my money back! My name is D*** C***! That's the fucking name it's under!

&gt;Bran- Ma'am, I'm the-

&gt;Lady- How did you know my name? What the fuck? How did you know who I am?

&gt;Bran- Ma'am-

&gt;Lady- You're taking my money and you don't even know who I am!

&gt;Bran- Ma'am, can I please speak?

\*Silence\*

&gt;Bran- I'm the one you spoke to yesterday, and we have call ID. That's why I know who you are. And, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how me telling you you're on the do not rent list Sunday would effect a reservation for Saturday. Which again, I do not see. Is it possible it was reserved under a different name?

&gt;Lady- No! It's under my name! Y'all charged me (some number) which doesn't even make sense! Do I need to call (Same brand, different location)?

&gt;Bran- Er, is that where you reserved for Saturday?

&gt;Lady- Yes!

&gt;Bran- ..........Then yes, they would be the ones who have the reservation.

"So tonight I get another prank call. He starts out by asking for our room rates. Then he says I sound like I'm sick. I said ""Oh yeah I have a little cold. No biggie.""
And I thought his response was, ""You should suck on some meth to clear that up."" And I said, ""Wait, what did you say meth?"" And he said, ""No NUTS!"" So I angrily responded, ""Oh a prank call!

"DG=Dumb Guest

Around 1:00 AM, DG called our night auditor to check our availability. DG chose a room type and agreed to the rate. Auditor proceeded to ask for his contact info and credit card number to guarantee the reservation. DG said thank you and ended the call. 

2 hours later, the auditor ran night audit. DG hadn't checked in or called to cancel. So as per standard hotel policy, he was charged as a No-Show.

I came in at 8:00 AM for the first shift the following morning. DG called asking why his card was charged. I looked it up and told him he was charged as a No-Show. I asked if he had called to cancel the reservation. He said, ""No, we decided to go to a different hotel."" I explained that he guaranteed the room with credit card. We held the room for him so the card was charged.

He was not happy with that answer. 
DG: ""So you charged me even though I didn't stay there? I never checked in.""
Me: ""Yes, sir. I understand, but you guaranteed the reservation with that card.""
DG: ""That is illegal. I didn't even want to make a reservation. I only wanted to check if you had a room.""

I immediately pointed out that didn't make sense. We don't require credit card information to check availability. There are several steps involved in making a reservation after confirming availability and rates. Why on Earth would you give your contact information and credit card number for a service you weren't prepared to buy?

DG got frustrated that I was calling him out on his bullshit. Cue the threats to complain to corporate, leave bad reviews, demand the manager, and call the police. I had to hang up on DG because of the name calling and incomprehensible yelling.

I opened a case with corporate myself. DG was not given a refund and was added to DNR. If he wasn't such an asshole, we might have actually refunded him.No-Show Stupidly Tried to Lie His Way Out Of Being Charged.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"To be fair, it was justified.

Happened the other day.

Our AYS lady (who is like a mother to me) knows the very basics of her job. She can answer most questions, but some are more complex. Whenever she doesn't know the answer, she'll ask someone who can.

She comes to desk to ask me and says this person on the phone is being super rude. Of course, I think it's the guest. I tell her to transfer the call to me.

It's the third-party rep. The issue was that the final price on the guest's confirmation had changed (ok, fair enough, I would call about that too). We charge a resort fee and it's been an ever-loving nightmare since we implemented it last summer. To make things worse, it's one (lower, more reasonable) price now, and increasing by $10 in a couple of months when we're getting into our busy season. 

When the guest booked, it said she'd have the lower resort fee. Somewhere in between booking the res a couple of weeks ago and now, she learned that we were charging the higher fee. Depending on when they booked, we may honor the lower fee. Like I said, a nightmare.

Anyway...

Third-party rep kept cutting me off and not accepting what I was telling her. After doing the appropriate math, the final balance was what the guest was told it would be when she booked.

She kept saying things like, ""Why is it different?"", ""That's not what I'm asking."", etc. Just pretty nasty. For the most part, I let it go, but by the end, I had had it.

We were wrapping up the conversation and I say, ""Do you have a supervisor I could speak with?""

Her: ""No ma'am. I'm sorry.""

Me: ""Even a trainer? Anyone above you would be fine.""

Her: ""No ma'am. We don't have the ability to do a three-way call.""

Me: ""OK, well in that case. I'm really not in the habit of telling people how to do their jobs, but you really need some additional training on how to speak to people who are only trying to help you.""

Her: ""Ok. And your last initial for my records?""

I tell her to have a nice day and we hang up.

The guest called right after and could not have been nicer. She said she's just been getting the runaround and was very confused about everything. I explained everything to her as clearly as I could and told her to call us directly with any further questions or concerns.

"I’ve been trying to decide on whether to post this or not since valentine’s day. i decided it’s too good not to post.

Valentine’s Day, i’m working third shift night audit as usual behind the front desk. A lady and a man check into our “cursed” room, Room 211. If something crazy happens, it’s ALWAYS Room 211. They are hugging and smiling and happy to be checking in for the holiday. I get them their room keys and direct them to their room.

Later that night, while i am filling out the departure slips that we slide under the doors for the people due to check out (them included), i happen to notice something. Room 211 has a special request on their reservation that for some reason states “We are celebrating our anniversary tonight!!!” and i decide to go the extra distance for them to make their stay more memorable.

I draw big giant hearts and cupid arrows through some of the hearts on their departure slip, and slip it under there door as per usual. Happy with myself, i hope i made their stay memorable. i go back to the night audit paperwork at the front desk.

A few hours later, the lady from Room 211 comes to the front desk, breathing hard, drenched in sweat, wearing only a way oversized t-shirt. The following conversation ensues:

(in between heavy breathing) “Hey - i’m in Room 211. Can i please get a couple extra large towels?”

“Havin’ that much fun up there, are ya?” i say as i wink at her.

“hell yeah! we are like wild animals up there!” she says as she starts giggling. 

“Well miss, here’s your extra towels. don’t have too much fun now, else we start getting complaint calls!” i say jokingly.

“If you get any complaints, does that mean you’re going to come up and see us?” she says as she winks at me.

“You know it!” i say with a laugh.

Her reservation is still pulled up on the computer. As she starts to walk away, i spot on the reservation on the computer where it says they are celebrating their anniversary tonight. I call out to her -

“Miss!”

“Yes sir?”

“I hope you and your husband have an amazing anniversary!!! Let me know if there is anything else i can do for you.”

She looks at me completely and totally confused for about 30 full seconds. 

“My husband??” she says. “Oh no sir, i’m staying in the room with my brother!” then she just walks back to her room, leaving me to wrap my mind around what just happened.Valentine’s Day Surprise",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Edit: I’m definitely going to press charges. 

Hello my hotel peeps, I’m back. I didn’t ever do an update on that, and I feel like I should. He definitely did it. I cancelled my card the moment I noticed it was gone, but my bank could still see if someone tried to use it. So two days after it went missing and I confronted my boss, well the husband, I got this job offer that I couldn’t turn down. Benefits, steady schedule, so much more money, and away from Mr &amp; Mrs Moneybags. So after the confrontation with my card, I didn’t have to go back. A week later, my bank called me to let me know that a room purchase of nearly $600 was attempted on my card. From the hotel I just quit. I was on the fence about pressing charges so I told them I would get back to them. I go look at their google reviews since most of them are shit, but I wanted to see how things were going. Apparently they hired somebody and the guy quit after like a day. He left a review basically saying that the managers will up the price online whenever somebody comes in claiming that it’s cheaper online. They never stock towels in the rooms, and if you leave your laundry for them to wash, they don’t wash it. Ugh life is so great away from that place. Crazy thing? They thought I would have $600 for them to jack when they cut my hours down to like three days a week working 5 hour shifts.It’s me, the one whose boss stole my debit card",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

He even wanted to drag me back down the hall to show me our lack of signs. I politely declined as  I didn't want to embarrass him. On my way to the bathroom I counted, five signs he passed to get to the first floor, all of them saying lobby is on 2 and arrows to which way.

"So, I was responding to another redditors tale and my response turned into a long assed story of my own so I figured I should not post there so I'll make my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely hate the ones that don't get that they cannot check in at midnight because it's now whatever date they want it to be.

I had a lady last Saturday night. She made her reservation online using points at 1:30am for Sunday.

She showed up shortly after booking after not finding her in the arrivals I did a search so I was like Oh! Well your reservation is for Sunday!

First she tells me that it IS Sunday. I had to explain to her that while it is past midnight it is still Saturday. Check in time for Sunday starts at 3pm. (now she had enough points to use to get a discount so you know she understands that it's not Sunday.)

After I explain that she changes her story to ""Well I booked at 10pm on Saturday, I told them when I made the reservation that I needed it for Saturday and they said it was ok."" While my brand can be booked past midnight, they have to call us prior because they can't see if we've run the audit yet so they need to know what day to book and all that good stuff .I never got a call, the room type would not have been available to be booked for Saturday, she booked it at 1:30am, AND she booked it online. There was no ""they"" involved.   

So, I started there. I told her that she booked through the website and at what time she booked. She didn't like that very much. 

I also explained that since she is using points I cannot modify this reservation at the property level (not 100% me being a dick, those fields are not editable on our side.) I could provide her with the reservations number, and would authorize a late reservation, but since it was for Saturday the rate would go up and her room type would have to be a different one than what she wants because it's presently occupied. 

She asked about early check in, I was like well,,, that will depend on the morning staff and the time the room becomes available for housekeeping to do their thing. Turns out even after explaining everything rather well I think. She actually meant early check in as in just check her in now! I started at the beginning and went through it all again. Again telling her all she had to do was call the reservations line. She left. 

No-showed Sunday so I ran her as such so we still got the point reimbursement.

Her complaint to corporate was of course WILDLY different than what I've described. Like ridiculously so. She left out the entire Saturday night thing. She left out the fact that she was trying to check in a day early, or that I referred her back to them. Her complaint stated that I just flat out told them they had a reservation but didn't have a room for them and there was nothing I could do so they were left stranded in town and had to sleep in her car. (Even though there are 4 other hotels within a block and all visible from our parking lot.) She also went on a smaller rampage complaining about how rude and nasty the girl on Sunday morning was. (Apparently getting an early check in didn't go her way.) 

I replied with a very thorough retelling of the events. They had already given her her points back though (which is bullshit). I'm not technically the one that responds to complaints but I could not let that go without providing the actual facts. ( I know they don't care, but I do.)But it IS Sunday",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I walked into my normal 3-11 shift, about ten minutes into my shift I got a phone call from one of the housekeepers daughters, she was freaking out and saying it was an emergency, so I ran and found her mom. Her mom instantly left. She came back about 45 minutes later asking for a room. She was with a man, that was not her fiance, I have never seen this man before at all, he was acting a little weird. I asked her who he was, and she said he was her brother and he is visiting from Mexico, I of course shook his hand and said hi, he acted less weird. I asked her why she needed a room, because the GM has to approve of the stay. She said her pipe busted from the cold and her house flooded. Ok good reasoning, I texted my GM and told her what happened with her house, GM said comp it, and let her stay for as long as she needs. I made the reservation and put the stay in for 2 nights, she said she only needed it for 2 nights. After that, I gave them the keys and told her to let me know if she needs help with anything.

Next day, I come in for my 3-11 shift like normal. Turned out to be a super slow night. I got everything done super early, I also deep cleaned everything, cleaned out Nates fish bowl. Chill night. It got to be the end of my night though, I was standing at the computer reading a book and sipping on some juice. 

My my doors opened. I looked up and a sheriff was walking in. He looked pissed. And my ass said, ""oh cool a sheriff! (insert my brain processing).....oh shit a sheriff!!!"" 

That man enjoyed that, he started laughing very hard. I am glad he enjoyed that, most embarrassing moment ever. BUT WHATEVER 

I asked what was up and if he wanted coffee, he said, ""I am looking for a man. I know he is here. Because he is staying under one of your co workers names."" 

And, at that moment that man new he struck gold, because my eyes went wide and my jaw dropped and another sheriff walked in with four cops. It took a minute for my brain to process, and I looked right at them and said ""I need a warrant dude""

They handed me the warrant for an arrest, same last name as my co worker. I asked how my co worker and the man were involved. He said they are brother and sister and he's here visiting from Mexico. 

I asked if my co worker will be in trouble. She has kids. They said she is the one who told them he was here and that she won't be in trouble at all, because as far as they know she knows nothing about the on going investigation against him. So, I assumed she knew he got into some shit, but not how serious of shit he got into. 

I told them I made the reservation and checked the room in. They asked what room number. I pulled the reservation up and it was no longer in my system. I told them somebody checked him out today it looks like, and I pulled up the records on that reservation and it showed he shortened the stay and left two hours after check out time. So, they were about ten hours too late in catching him. They asked to see the room, I told them it will be useless to see it, because he checked out and it'll be empty. They still asked to see it, so I took them to the room, and they went cop mode. Like, they wouldn't let me walk ahead of them, somebody was behind me at all times, four of them went and searched the other floors. I opened the door to the room, and one of them pushed me against the door, he had his gun in one hand, his free arm shielding me, the other cop stormed the room with his gun out as well, they were yelling and giving orders. Like I told them before, nobody was in there, and nobody was in there still. 

We all left the room, they continued to search the hotel along with the outside, I gave them all the information they needed or I could give and they left. Two sheriff cars stayed outside for the rest of the night though watching the hotel. 

I called my managers right after they left and told them what just happened. They started freaking out, my GM sounded heartbroken, and was more upset that the housekeeper lied to her and, I thought ""yeah be mad she lied about busted pipes, it's not like she hid a wanted FUCKING MAN IN THE HOTEL"" LIKE COME ON DUDE

I was on the phone with them for thirty minutes arguing about whether to tell my night auditor or not. I didn't want to tell him at all. He is a gossiper and we have had huge issues with him starting drama and spreading rumors, which causes fights with everybody. We didn't want to tell him about this, because he will tell EVERYBODY and as far as we know, this stays between me, the managers, and the housekeeper. They decided to tell him though, because in case they came in and questioned him too, they wanted to have him aware. They gave him a brief description of what happened, we asked if he knew anything and he said no, so they wouldn't be asking him anything further then that. They also told him, if he gossips, it will be a write up. He kept his mouth shut. 

The next day, I come into work, I asked my manager if they talked to the housekeeper. They said yes. I asked if she was ok, she said she isn't ok and she understands why she hid a wanted man in the hotel, wishes she didn't do it, but she understands. He apparently did some very bad things, she wouldn't tell me, I expected her not to, not my business. My manager told me to pretend like nothing happened and that to just smile at her and make her laugh if I can. So I did.

I continue to smile and make her laugh, because I have no idea what happened to him and if she really is ok. Nobody talks about what happened, and nobody knows what happened that night besides me, the managers, and the housekeeper.""Oh shit a Sheriff!!"" - Me 2020",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work second shift (3-11pm) at a hotel chain the offers a complementary breakfast. After breakfast is cleared, most of the food gets put up in the back kitchen. The exception to this is the cereal dispenser, which remains on the counter with a cover over the handles, which usually works as a deterant from people helping themselves. Usually.

Last night, about 8:30, a couple of teens came down off the elevator and go to sit in the dining room. This is fairly common. Teens traveling with family who don't want to hang out in the room go wandering for a quiet place to hang out. No big deal.

Until I hear the cereal dispenser. I can't seen it from the front desk, but it is a distinctive sound. I loudly say from the desk ""The cereal is for breakfast only."" I hear another bowl getting filled. I then walk around the desk and look into the breakfast area.

The two teens are sitting there, conveniently avoiding my glance. I notice that the cover has been placed back on the dispenser. I started to repeat my statement when the phone rang. I figured that they each got their bowl, I had told them to stop, everything should be okay. Right? 

I walk back to the desk and take the phone call and continue my duties. Ten minutes later, I hear the cereal again. I quickly pop up the 'Desk manager will be back directly' sign, grab the cordless phone, and walk into the breakfast area. I look at both of them (still trying to avoid my gaze) and very loudly say 'Guys, the cereal is here for breakfast only."" 

The girl says ""oh, okay."" 

The boy on the other hand decides that he is in the mood to argue.

""Well, if it's free at breakfast, why can't we get some now?""'

I had been trying to be nice because I didn't want to be ""that uptight bitch"", but I was annoyed now.

""Yes, the cereal is free for *breakfast*."" I pointed to the sign on the wall that states the hours for breakfast. ""As you can see, breakfast is over. The cereal is one of the options that we provide. It is free for breakfast, not for when ever you feel like coming down and getting it."" 

I turned away from them, grabbed the cereal dispenser (it's not super heavy, just kind of bulky) and carry it into the back kitchen. I then make a huge show of locking the back kitchen area.

I put on my fake at customer service voice and say ""You guys have a great evening!""It's free in the morning, why not now?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Long and ranty like all of my posts.

tldr at the end.

Yup.

I work at a VERY small property in the  center of our city's historic district.  We are privately owned and not affiliated with any national brand.  

When I say ""small"" I mean 19 rooms,  and by ""privately owned"" I mean it's owned by a dude we see working every day.  

Even though we are small we are VERY popular.  We are located in an area where an iconic movie filmed most of their most famous scenes.  We are a historic property that's also haunted so we are included on every tour.

The other day I get a call from a travel agent in LA who has a million questions on behalf of her client who wants to stay a week, book tours, needs airport transport, might be bringing a friend...

I answer all her questions and give a stellar sales pitch while also doing my other front desk duties and serving breakfast, because it's  literally just me and the chef doing everything since the other two girls who were supposed to work were late (busses? Mystery illness that's miraculously cured the next day? Dead relative? It's hard to keep up sometimes.)

She asks me to send her an email detailing the things we discussed and then asked me if we paid commission to agents for their bookings.

This is my first hotel job, and I've never dealt with travel agents, but since this was the first I'd heard of this ""commission for travel agents"" my gut was telling me the answer was ""no way"".  

I give her the guest approved version of ""I doubt it but I'll ask"" which is the best I can do.

She continues to drive home her commission, even asking me to inflate the prices for her in my email to add it in. She gets the guest approved version of ""hard no"".

We end up agreeing to my plan (really the ONLY plan but still) and I dutifully ask my manager about ""travel agent commission"" and *spoiler alert!"" that's a ""hard no"" from owner dude himself.

I type up the email that includes the bad news about the agent commission and I assume that's the last I'd hear from miss travel agent.

Nope!

I wake up to another email with some more questions about occupancy and blah blah blah AND... COMMISSION!  Lady seriously?!? It doesn't take a genius to see I make ZERO decissions here!

So i, again, answer all of her questions and I even include some verbage that we could book and handle billing through Miss Agent and the actual guest would recieve confirmations and such that did not include pricing.

Come on lady!! HINT f#cking HINT! YOU, Miss Pain-in-my-ass-agent, add the commission in on YOUR end.  Like a regular business! Right? I'm going out on a limb even alluding to this even though it's business 101!!

I receive a reply email (IN ALL CAPS) that I will quote in it's entirety since it's amazing and absurd and I literally couldn't believe it!

""RECEIVED/DULY NOTED.

 

HAVE FORWARDED YOUR QUOTE TO MY CLIENT.

 

THANKS FOR YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE""

Ummm... She just yelled at me in an email! Wtf?!?

I didn't know what to do so I emailed her back ""thank you for your (non-existent) understanding"" ""hope to do business with you"" ""please leave me alone you psycho"" guest approved version of ""please go away"" and I have had 12 whole hours of peace although I'm doubtful it will last.

If I go missing, there's a travel agent in LA who HATES ME!

"So a bit of happy feels and faith in humanity restored:  


We have a couple who drive a semi that stay with us every so often; very sweet people with a friendly shepard pup. Right now they're here between drives with their truck being serviced.   


So Im puttering around on the desk (Again, yay Sunday slowness!) and the wife walks up with one of the bowls from the room. ""Are you allergic to nuts?""  


Im not so I say so and she hands me a chocolate brownie freshly baked. ;w; &lt;3 Absolutely delicious.   
My stomach is happy and my mood is 100% better.   


Gotta love the guests that treat us like human beings instead of NPCs.A little warm fuzzies for a Sunday. :D",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello fellow NPCs! I bring you the conclusion of the tale nobody was waiting for! plus a couple of interactions that made me look into the camera like I was in The Office:

First, An update for this post: reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/c82auf/there\_is\_a\_curse\_on\_my\_guests. We ended up placing a sign saying parking lot to your left in one of the trees on the right of the road. Curse lifted, no more questions regarding where our parking lot even though it is still literally across the street from the hotel. If anybody know what to do with a bunch of curse ritual ingredients give me a call because they are not refundable!

We went independent last year and not having to deal with people yelling at you for show just to contact corporate and get 1 vajayjayllion points because of imaginary issues is really nice; Our manager of 13 years walked out of the job because she tried firing an employee she didn't like (No reason just hated them and tried to do shady stuff to fire them) she didn't get her way so she walked out which made me the new Front Desk Manager during Christmas rush (Trying to get breakfast supplies when everything was on her locked PC and nobody, not even the owner knew where we got stuff from was really fun you guys!!1!UNO!) So that was not so nice, but overall thinks are going great!

So we got rid of people complaining to scam corporate for free stuff, that left us with....not so smart people complaining about stuff. How natural selection hasn't gotten them is a mystery for me. Since I'm the new manager I am the one dealing with these lovely beings:

\-Lady was upset because she saw me setting up breakfast and pouring the milk and juice from plastic gallons, She wanted freshly squeezed juice AND MILK because she was paying for it and she wasn't gonna take less than that. FRESHLY SQUEEZED MILK. After trying to logically comprehend what she was requesting and asking her WHERE WAS I GONNA GET A COW IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN. I spent a good 15 minutes trying to explain that what she was requesting was a bit out of reach. She said she wanted a refund for the breakfast and she wasn't eating any of it. Sure, let me give you back your $0! Never saw her again during breakfasts for the next couple of days.

\-We have a guest satisfaction police (which is a remnant of our brand days where if you don't like the room, hotel, curtains, my face or anything else and let me know in the first 30 minutes, we will refund your money and cancel your reservation no questions asked). We try to fix whatever it is wrong (Except my face, unfortunately, that is what it is) but if you are still not happy just go and take your money, no reason why to force you to stay. This lady checked in telling me it is for her birthday, I comp their parking as a little gift and send her her way, she saw the room, came back to the front desk, asked me a few questions about the room and left. 3 hours later she calls me telling me she changed her mind and that her grown ass daughter didn't feel right in the room, and that she left but decided not to tell me. So she wants a refund. I ask her what she meant with ""not right"" so we can fix it and that we do have other rooms if it was something specific about that room! She gets aggressive tells me no, just get me my money back you thieve! So naturally I told her no, you could have gotten a refund with the guest satisfaction policy in the first 30 minutes. but it is over 3 hours now. She throws a fit because yes, she signed, but she didn't read so it wasn't her fault. She apparently is going to sue. Looking forward to that! She also took the parking pass with her which has a big sign in it saying that if you take it we will charge you a fine. I sent her bill through email with a note stating that if she comes back with the pass I will refund the fine for taking it. She came back a few hours later, threw the pass at me (it's make of plastic so it kinda slid its way to me) and told me I needed to learn compassion because I didn't ask nor care how her daughter was feeling (????????????????)

\-Guest visiting from Mexico wants a dinner recommendation. Great! I have tons of really cool and not expensive places to recommend around the hotel! Unfortunately, none of those places are good because he only wants Mexican food, but not any kind of Mexican food. It has to be authentic!! Like and I quote ""Food that my grandma would make"" I politely tell him that since I don't know his grandma nor how she cook I can't give him an answer. I can give him some recommendations of great Mexican restaurants but apparently that's not good enough. He wrote a review about how I refused to help him and ruined his stay. The power I have to ruin people's vacation is just far too much! P.S Next time bring your grandma as personal chef my dude!

\-Couple complaints about the vent in the bathroom making too much noise. My agent offers them another room and comp their parking as an apology for the issues. They don't want another room, according to them, it is too late to move their stuff! (10:30pm) We offer them the keys to another room so they can sleep in another room nearby and keep their stuff in the old room (the room was going to be dirty anyways so might as well) No, His wife is already in bed and she doesn't want to get up, she offers to go take a look, maybe she can tighten it up. They don't want her in the room. She offers the screwdriver so HE can tighten it! How dare she make him do manual labor in the middle of the night (Again 10:30pm). So, having exhausted all solutions, they ended up getting my card from my agent and talking to me in the morning. They were staying for one night. They want me to fix it. (confused). How Can I fix something that A) already happened. and B) was offered 100 solutions but they didn't want to take it. He says he doesn't care but he wants a solutions NOW. I ask him what would be an acceptable solution......he doesn't know. Since nobody knows anything and I can't change the building set up for the vents he leaves angry, I stay confused and I receive a lovely review about not offering a satisfactory solution and promising NEVER TO COME BACK AGAIN. If only they kept their promises - watches the horizon- if only.

Update: The lady that wanted a refund 3 hours later posted a review page:

"On the heels of this past month, I've been told this was one of our busiest in recent past.  I've feel the need to unwind from it coming into the spring season, and had a few moments to share to bring you folks some entertainment. For context my property is a locally owned boutique motel in the heart of downtown in my area.  We're a small remodeled Travelodge, and not part of any brand or chain.  This means while we're still found through the third party sites, and have our own website.  We're not part of any brand or chain, so there's no corporate overlords making decisions from an ivory tower.  I wouldn't call us so much a family establishment, as we're more the kind of place you come to when you want to get away from the kids for a night, and drink, but not have to worry about the drive back.  We're a whole lot cheaper than a DUI.  Thing is, being a downtown property, we're limited on our parking.  We've more rooms than parking spaces, and the city tends to shrug their shoulders at the situation and say 'just use the street'  which is fine most nights, but it has it's own difficulties that will become relevant later.  On to the story

&amp;#x200B;

Weekend One: Fat Tuesday, but 19 days early.

A big thing in my part of the US is Martis Gras.  We're only a half days drive to New Orleans, and there's some more than others that take the season seriously.  King Cakes, Louis Armstrong albums, the whole shebang of NOLA debauchery minus the public flashing. I'm not too familiar with the culture, but there are groups involved with the parades and such are split up among what they call a 'crewe'(sic) Mostly they're just rich white boomers who get together and blow a bunch of money on a float, and get drunk together.  One such group I'll call ""Crewe Des Karens""  Every year they book us out completely for one weekend when they have one of their balls.  I was terrified of this group from the moment I started because they had every sign of the entitled guests.  Whenever they'd call, they always expected me to know every detail about their stays just by giving me their names.  An example of one of my first calls from them.

Me: {Standard phone greeting} How can I help you?

CDK: (Already yelling) Yeah, John Smith just called me and he's telling me you told him you ain't got rooms!  We've blocked X for the Crewe of Karens and...!

Me: -I sort of cut him off- Sir, sir.  I need you to slow down. Because I, personally never told anyone that.  I'm not sure who did. But from looking at the availability right now. It appears we're overbooked.

This went on for a bit, and I explain that I'm kinda the new guy, and not too familiar with how this certain event is ran, but would have the manager call them in the morning.  The others weren't so hostile, but it was clear their communication is broken, because one would book an extra 2 or 3 rooms for their friends, only for that friend to call and make reservations for themselves.  At one point because of this, there was another argument with the manager when they canceled some rooms for the people who'd already booked themselves.  Others heard on their Facebook group that there were cancellations, so people tried jumping in where there was really nothing opening up.  This was all happening in the fall of last year.  During the months in between our Manager decides to just be the one to handle the booking for that group.  Nobody else was to do anything about their reservations.  Sadly, this doesn't lead into it being more problems, as he really busted his ass dealing with every one of them and kept it well organized from there.

When the day finally came, I prepared for the worst.  Upon arrival I find our parking lot packed full.  Not just with cars, but with drunk Karens and Chads our on our patio.  They'd even brought their own grill.  Turns out, most all of them had checked in already and were well into their weekend of day drinking.  They wound up being perfectly pleasant, and didn't cause a single problem.  I'm actually looking forward to them coming on next year.

&amp;#x200B;

Week 2:  V-day

Honestly.  Not much to write home about.  Sorry to disappoint. The only odd thing I remember was a conversation with a guest about how he was staying that night to get AWAY from his wife.  She'd apparently had the flu, and due to the monthly new cycle, that meant he thought it'd best to stay away.

&amp;#x200B;

Week 3:  The Parade

These are truly my nightmare.  Anytime the city throws a parade. It's guaranteed to pass right in front of the hotel.  This usually means we become more of a public bathroom than a motel.  Also this wasn't just one parade.  It was two.  One on Friday night.  The other Saturday afternoon.  Now a lot of people come and stay with us, because of the super convenient location.  Some could just put up a lawn chair at their front door and have a good view from there if you're not looking to get beads or moonpies.  But mostly people think that by staying here, will buy them rights to our parking lot.  Thing is, they also invite there friends to come and park here as well.  Remember when I mentioned how the city shrugs and say ""just use the street""?  That helps nothing when that street overflow is blocked off so the parade can pass, and I'm the one people look at to find an answer when there's nothing available.  I didn't even want to think about finding parking, and luckily it was a cheap Lyft ride.  It was hectic, loud, and obnoxious.  But we pulled through It was one of the first weekends I didn't have to handle the 3-11 shifts by myself.  We even doubled our money just with the manager out front selling beer during the Saturday parade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Week 4:  Comic-Con

The last weekend was our annual Comic-Con.  This, I thought would be the easiest of them all.  Geeks are pretty chill, right? All my geeky friends are. Turns out I was very wrong.  Most every who stayed either checked in Thursday, or Friday, and just stayed the whole weekend.  I think that Sat I had three reservation checkins on a sold out night. Friday our city also through one of it's monthly things.  It's a night where all the downtown art galleries open their doors, and they shut down part of the streets, and the restaurants will pull out some tables out there.  This happens a few blocks down, so we're not blocked off like we are on the parade.  But the increase in people coming to downtown, means more of that street parking the city tells us to use is already in use.  

This brought the highlight of confrontations of my story.  In walks who I'll dub Sharon &amp; Thad.  Thad walks in, with Sharon behind them.  So named because Sharon fit a few of the check marks of a Karen.  But wasn't the one demanding answers.  She really only tried to reign in Thad during his hostility, but clearly wasn't happy.  Thad on the other hand.  Walks in like a traumatized bull to me like I'm dressed as matador and huffs.

Thad: We have reservations, but there is absolutely no parking out there!  I mean none!

Me:  Well, I'm sorry sir.  If there's nothing in the parking lot, all that's left is the street.

Thad:  There isn't any even there!  Someone in that lot shouldn't be here!

Me:  ALL of those cars are our guests.  I'm sorry, but we're a downtown property that's limited on our parking.  We're quite open about our free parking is first come, first serve.

Sharon:  It didn't say that when we booked.

Me:  (\*Seeing that they booked third party\*) We cannot be responsible for what third parties advertised.

Thad:  Your fucking manager told us that we'd have parking.  I'm sorry, I don't cuss. But you pushed me too far!

Me:  I'm sorry sir, but I can't bend space and time, as much as I'd like to.  We're a downtown property, with a convention three blocks away, and the city is doing their Gallery Night.  There is nothing I can do for parking.

Now, I called this guy Thad, because while he had the personality of a hyper-agressive Chad.  He had the physical physique of a Hershey's Kiss with legs...and he routinely skips leg day.  I have a feeling he tends to use his size to intimidate while not having to keep promises he can't keep.  He was tall, about 6'3-6'5.  But as my username suggests, I'm no small fry either.  I'm not saying I'm in better shape, but people tend to think twice before they get too froggy with a guy my size. I was also confident I could run faster scared than he can mad...And I'm the smoker between us.  

At this point Thad starts kicking at the counter like a baseball coach kicking at the sand as he argues with the umpire.

Thad: We called, and asked if there would be parking for two cars!  YOUR MANAGER! Told us you wouldn't and that everyone would get ONE parking spot!

Sharon: \*To Thad\* Now stop. \*Hands me the info to finish the checkin\*

Basically it boiled down to a miscommunication where they assumed the room guaranteed them a spot. It goes on like this because his tantrum was a bit amusing to me. Right up until:

Thad: I'm gonna go online and destroy this place's reputation with reviews.

At that point I gave him a death glare.  Had I not had just clicked the button to charge the third party card I would've thrown his ass out right then.  I had taken this as he was going to start astroturfing and going on to make complaints that while damning, didn't really exist. But since it was a third party order, and we had the money anyway, I tell him the manager will be around in the morning and give them their room key.  I wait a few minutes after while they were unloading out front, and I go back out to give the last option I had.  I explained that I'd spoken to the owner, and they could park on the side of our patio out front.  A place where we're really not supposed to park there, but I had no other option, and the owner did give me the approval to do this a little while earlier in the night.  Thad actually apologized to me, much to my surprise. He admitted to knowing it's not my fault, but he'd just been on the road 4-5 hours to get here.  He would've come sooner had he known the parking was thistight.  I thought cool, that's the end of that.  All was well and good, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Nope.  I come back the next day, and during my start of shift briefing, I'm told what happened that morning.  Apparently we're a roach infested cesspool because the shower only came to his mid-chest.  Granted, as the fates would have it. He got the ONE room at our place that hadn't had a detachable shower head installed on it yet. However as I'm sure my homies at /r/tall could agree with me, this is all too common of a problem when you're above 6'.  Washing your hair can be a backbreaking task unless you want soap in your eyes. They decided that morning that they weren't going to stay, so effectively they got a free night out of us.  Which is fine, but I did warn my manager that he'd threatened to go and talk shit in our reviews.  To which the manager replied that since he was given a full refund, he won't be allowed to review.

"Y'all just get those guest that are staying for a week and they are CONSISTENTLY down at the front desk/lobby they always have a question, ""a HUGE favor"" or a request?  Like how do they keep on coming up with this shit? Do they ever realize they are driving me crazy!? (over exaggerating but you get the point).

I think I am only annoyed today because I am working by myself, again. It has finally gotten slow enough so I can order food from our restaurant and sit in the back office and eat. I SWEAR this lady planned this shit. As soon as the server said my food was ready. This guest came and asked me a bunch of questions, and she wanted to use the printer but our ""Printer On"" (wireless/air printing) thing was not working. So she demands I call IT so we can fix this... so guess who's food just sat in the back for 30-60 mins getting cold af, me... 

I'm writing this out of pure annoyance and hunger, so sorry if this comes off bitchy or whatever. But I feel like y'all understand my pain. I think the main thing is, is that I am working by myself alot and for the most part its not to bad but I literally cannot take a break so I don't get any time to just walk away from the desk and kinda chill out.

"A few people asked how the story ends and I've got some time so here it is. The second half of this tale is also where the story got its namesake. Pt. 1 here https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/f7wt16/a_criminal_conspiracy/

Characters for this half are as follows: 

DI better known as Detective Idiot the worlds greatest detective

BR = Bartender one of my coworkers and possibly the best customer service rep. I've ever met 

ME = Me, the narrator taking you on this lovely trip through memory lane. I'm mostly a secondary character in the events of this half as I could no longer subject myself to DI's orthodox interrogation methods.

A long time ago in a hotel far far away I angered the hospitality gods and they sought retribution in the form of the worlds greatest detective. From here on out known as Detective Idiot. DI was like any other guest before the gods decided we should share a special moment in hospitality guest relations. I did not check him in and he was just a name and a room number until he needed something because of course he did. 

We rejoin our protagonist (me) behind the front desk. Trying to wrap my head around the events of the last 30 minutes and where it all went wrong. My coworker can now see the dread on my face after being lectured about design choices I had no part in deciding. If a lightswitch ever has any bearing on how your day goes understand you've lost, pack it up, and try again tomorrow. Unfortunately I still had about 3 hours left on my shift.

As payback for the many pranks and goofs i've pulled during my time there my coworker decides to try and make light of the situation after i've finished explaining what just happened. The phone rings and they answer, ""hey funburgers, its that guy again he wants to switch back to his original room."" I whip the keys in my hand at the wall out of frustration and they stick into the wallpaper.

Me: ""Fuck you, that's not funny"" 

""No, seriously. He said since the lights are working he wants to move back."" Queue a littany of profanities and internalized screaming. My frustration had hit its boiling point. I refuse to deal with this man and insist my coworker head up to deal with him and his eternal wisdom. Im met with a reply of ""oh come on he cant be that bad."" Give it five minutes.

I have a strange quirk that the more bothered I am the more pleasant and helpful I am to the next guest. A few check ins arrive and my coworker still hasn't returned some 10 minutes later from what should've been a simple key swap. Part of me wants to laugh, part of me wants to cry knowing what I just subjected them to but we are nothing if not professionals. 

BR notices a line of people at the desk as i'm working my way through getting them all checked in and walks over to welcome the guests and smooth the process over. After the line has been cleared BR asks me where coworker is. They know me too well by this point and can hear in my voice when somethings up. ""Oh they're upstairs helping a guest move rooms"" InnocentFace.jpeg

BR: ""Damn they've been gone for like 15 minutes."" Oh, I know. I proceed to explain some of what just transpired when coworker reappears from the elevator looking like the vietnam flashback dog.

BR begins laughing after seeing both of our faces. Not to worry BR's time would soon come for none shall be spared on this night. Coworker begins explaining how DI grilled them on the lightswitch being supposedly upside down. I generally like to believe in scenarios like this if you don't laugh you're gonna cry. There is neither, only pain and frustration. With both of our moods soured we head to the back to angrily delve into our phones in the hopes of forgetting DI's existence if only for a short time.

Why can't he just accept that objectively the lights work? Why does it matter what direction the switch is facing if it indeed turns the lights on? Im gonna find whoever let him book here and I swear to god...how much time has passed since I started angrily scrolling reddit? 

The next thing I know I hear cackling at the front desk. The type of laughter that can only be conceived by Monty Python levels of absurdity. However much time has passed while my coworker and I sought relief in our bomb shelter has given DI time to move about the complex. He made his way towards the doors that lead outside, but fate would throw yet another obstacle in his path.

There are many doors that go outside of this property, two in particular lead towards the patio. Due to whatever ingenious lawmakers decided you're allowed to drink outside so long as the area is fenced in we in fact have a patio. DI attempted to make his way to his car and stumbled upon these magnificent doors only to be stumped. In fact, there was a three foot railing blocking his path to freedom and combustible engines. I've hopped this fence many times but perhaps that is the arrogance of youth.

BR being a shining light of customer service walked over to greet DI and inform him of the nearest door that would lead to his destination. A fatal mistake for all would feel the wrath of DI. 

BR: ""Sir, were you headed to the parking lot?""

DI: ""Yes, i'm trying to get to my car but there's a fence""

BR: ""I'm sorry sir those doors lead to the patio. There's another door that leads to the parking lot down the hall that's closer to where you're parked"" 

DI: ""What you people are doing here is criminal, what if there's a fire. Everyone in here is gonna die. The sign clearly says exit.""

...

Upon hearing BR relay this interaction I cannot contain my laughter. I'm belly laughing like i'm at a Mitch Hedberg show. Tears stream down my face as I lose all control. My coworker is handling a guest and asks me to come to the front and fulfill their request. As I attempt to regain composure the guest can't help but also laugh and ask what's going on.

"We all got an email yesterday from the GM about a recent bad review. 

I live in Canada, and we've had a bit of snow recently, enough to make the parking lot slippery. Part of the Front Desk duties in the evening is to salt the entrances and keep the snow cleared. 

According to the review, a guest fell in the parking lot and told the GSA about it when they got in. Instead of saying ""are you okay"" or ""do you need any medical attention"", the GSA said ""be careful, it's slippery out there"". Big yikes. This GSA's performance as of late hasn't been the best in my opinion, and nothing seems to be getting through to them. If I were Management, I would give them a warning because of everything else that they've been doing wrong, but they don't seem to care when I bring things to their attention...""Be careful, it's slippery out there!""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Yesterday was Saturday. Most of you know Friday night and Saturday nights are the busiest at the hotel. We have an indoor pool, so this time of year, we get a lot of entitled people wanting to use the pool. (Tax time also leads to a lot of local riffraff coming in.) We have been having trouble with pool towels disappearing. We get new ones in, put them out, and then next thing I know, we only have 15-20 again. Endless cycle.

Well, I was working alone, and like it always happens, I got a rush of 8 rooms trying to check in all at once. I'm just doing my thing, knocking them out, smiling and keeping the crowd happy. 

About three rooms into the line, I notice a man has walked into the lobby and is standing off to the side. He is in his swim trunks, completely dry. I smile at him, showing that I see him, and then continue the line. I get through another room, and then he decides to tell out in the lobby, ""Excuse me! We need towels down in the pool!"" 

I looked up from the counter at him, pretty shocked. I looked at the line, who are all also looking at this man, and then back at him to respond. ""Yes sir. I am the only one here, so it's gonna be a few minutes. I will get them down there as soon as I can.""

The man then looks at me, mouth wide open, as if he expected me to drop the line in front of me to take towels down to the pool (remember, he wasn't even in line, he was standing off to the side.)  He rolls his eyes, throws up his hands and says, ""This place is unbelievable."" He then turns and walks back down towards the pool.

I obviously have a look of surprise on my face, because the guest I was in the middle of helping said ""Wow!""

I continued checking the line in, got it knocked out, went to the laundry room and got a cart of the regular bathroom towels (no more pool towels to be found anywhere) and start the walk down.

I walk into the pool area, to see the entitled man in the pool with his wife. He looks up, rolls his eyes at me again and says, ""well, that took ya long enough!""

I put on my fake customer service smile and apologize. In the back of my mind, I'm trying to figure out what the rush is. He is still in the pool, so he obviously didn't need them yet. But I just put the towels on the shelf and walk out.

"We currently have a youth hockey team taking up 16 rooms at our property. Earlier today, two of the rooms came up to the desk early on in my shift and asked for late checkouts tomorrow. We only allow a small amount of late checkouts, and tomorrow there are 57 checkouts out of 71 rooms. So far 10 other rooms from that team have asked for late checkouts, and they are taking up our larger rooms too. A few have been understanding. Most have been pains in the asses about it. One guy, after being the eighth to ask and be denied, raised hell and threatened to call corporate. Our housekeeping staff is going to be working their asses off tomorrow as is without an insane amount of late checkouts. Luckily, I'm here in the morning. Our normal checkout time is noon, fairly generous as is, but that only leaves a three hour turnaround time. If anyone from that team still has gear and luggage in their rooms past 12:45, I'm charging them for the day. They asked and they were told no. They know the rules. So, we'll see how tomorrow goes.We can't give late checkouts to your entire hockey team",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work at a smaller hotel chain location, and it’s a Sunday so morning shift is pretty busy. No big deal. I arrived at 6:45am this morning just to have extra time to settle in and get all my reports lined up etc. 

This very lovely and wonderful gentleman calls the front desk to complain about a dog barking. However, his words and attitude = wack. “Do you know where that damn dog that’s barking is?” Umm no sir. I don’t, but I can try my best to locate them. “Well it’s been going on for an hour, and you have to understand that it’s 8am.” Yes sir, I’m sorry. This is the first complaint I’ve gotten, but I will locate the dog. “Well what if I find him first?” &lt;—— what does that even mean? 

Speechless. It irks me to no end when guests assume that we have the staff to roam the halls looking for issues. Also, when guests assume that someone else will call about a problem? If you’ve been listening to a dog bark for an hour, and haven’t called (which I know he hadn’t since I arrived at 6:45) then why are you mad at me? 

Thank you for listening to my rant. If you’re ever a guest a hotel, please call the front desk with issues. We are more than happy to help.

"It's another Saturday night in my small town close to the House of Mouse, and once again we are sold out.  This is the busy season in Florida so we consistently sell out on weekends, and sometimes even during the week.  Now I know some hotel chains have a policy that you are supposed to keep a room for super shiny members, or walk a guest for a super shiny member, but my chain does not have this policy.

I will be Me in this story, and you guessed it Super Shiny Member will be SSM

SSM Stops and reads the signs on my door which say No Vacancy and No Rooms Available.  You know just because some people have no idea what Vacancy is, and after reading the signs proceeds to walk in anyway.

Me: Hello sir what can we do for you this evening?

SSM: Yes, I need a room.  I see that you have no vacancy, but I'm a super shiny member so you have a room that you keep for us.

Me: Um unfortunately sir I am all sold out tonight and my hotel has no such policy.

SSM: Your Corporate Brand requires you to have a room for us super shiny members just in case, or you are required to cancel a reservation and give me their room, and send them on down the road.

Me: Sir I can assure you that even though some corporate brands do have this policy, we are not one of those brands that do.  

SSM: Yes you are!  You people don't know your own policies.  This is the third property in this brand that doesn't have a room for us super shiny members.  You should read your policies.

Me: I will definitely look into that sir, but perhaps if I'm the third hotel to tell you that this policy doesn't exist, then it quite possibly could be true.

SSM:  So now I'm a liar, is that what you are saying.

Me: Absolutely not sir, you might just be misinformed.

SSM: Get me your Manager, he will set you straight and I'll get my damn room.

Me: Well sir I am the GM, so unfortunately I'm it.  I don't have any rooms available, I don't have one that I'm required to hold for Super Shiny Members, and I'm not going to cancel a reservation because you want a room.  I do apologize,  I can try to make some suggestions if you'd like

SSM: Nope I'll find a hotel outside of your corporate chain, you have lost my business since you can't follow your own policies.  You'll be hearing from your corporate chain about this.

Me: Well that is fine sir, you have a great night.  


I seriously think this guy has gotten our chain mixed up with some other chain.  I don't know how y'all that have this policy make it work.  It would drive me insane.

"Hello all! Welp, one of our night auditors moved on from the business, leaving yours truly to cover the Audit till our new hire is trained. This means I can share wonderful stories again, and **boy** did I get a wonderful welcome back present.

Below is the actual transcript from a complaint that came through corporate *today*. I wasn't here when any of this went down, and I've added my own commentary at points....but snuggle up, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this doozy of a review!

*-Context - I work at a larger hotel in a downtown metropolitan area near a stadium that hosts an XFL team*

*-ahem-*

""""Your 3 pm check-in policy is stupid. How's that for an opening line? If I show up two hours early and let the front desk know I'm there, I should be in that room within 30 minutes. (*OMG LOL*) ""House keeping isn't done with your room,"" is a stupid excuse for making me sit in a hotel lobby for a couple hours. Your hotel will be the only one in 100 stays that didn't get my room ready in 30 minutes. Your employees are lame.(*ouch, oof, owie*) I've got somewhere to be at 2:30 and won't be back to the hotel for five hours. Why won't they get my room ready? What is wrong with this hotel? Management? There is no excuse. This is unacceptable. You have a golden opportunity here. Convince me to use any &lt;brand&gt; related hotel again. Go ahead. Do something to compensate for this poor performance. (*nah, I'll pass on that one pal after reading the rest of this rant*)The internet is full of better options and at a better price.

In my last 100 hotel stays, if I arrive after 11 am and tell the front desk that I want to go into my room, I have always been treated with respect, which translates into my room being ready for me in less than 20 minutes. (*AGAIN, LOL*)  Always.  That's professional behavior.  That's what I expected from &lt;brand&gt; hotels. I didn't get that from two attendants at the &lt;hotel name&gt;, I got ""lazy.""

  This included a lame excuse about not having all of their house cleaning people at work that day."" (*In fairness, we had six calloffs today, and our housekeepers had 27 rooms each. But please, keep going*)
I said that I'd like them to put a fire into house keeping because I wanted to get into my room now.  There was one bright person at the desk (*coincidentally the only white dude. Odd.*) and he got on the radio and called someone and asked that they get my room ready.  Then he left for the day and what remained were two lazy  people (*of color....*) who didn't seem to care that I was patiently waiting thirty feet from them, asking them every 15 minutes if my room was ready, and trying to engage into their brains the idea that it would be professional courtesy to give the customer what he wants.  But no, lazy is as lazy does and I was forced to leave before I could get into my room.    

Then the situation at the &lt;Hotel Name&gt; got worse.  After attending a football game
I came back to the hotel to discover that I wasn't allowed to use my cell phone as a room key, the &lt;brand rewards&gt; app wouldn't let me use it. (*Yes, you're an entry level rewards member and we have to activate it at the desk, but you weren't patient enough for that, were you?*)  I went to the front desk, put my luggage ticket on the counter (*slammed it*) and said (*shouted*) that I wanted my luggage.  I also said the &lt;brand&gt; app wouldn't let me use my cell phone as a room key.  This is where the desk attendants went from being lazy to being stupid.   

 They gave me room keys (*oh look! YOU HAVE YOUR ROOM*) that were three floors down from the room I had reserved through &lt;brand rewards program&gt;. (*yeah, because we put a rush on a room and checked you into it while you were gone to make your arrival when you came back easier!!!!*) I pointed this out but they still couldn't figure out how to get me a room. (*YOU. HAVE. YOUR. ROOM.*) Or how to make my cell phone into a room key.  I felt like I had to take a shower because the ""stupid"" was so prevalent.  I just couldn't stay at that hotel with lazy and stupid people.  

 So, for the first time in my life I walked away from a hotel reservation, not caring that I'd lose whatever &lt;brand&gt; will charge me for not getting my room.  I said that I was done, I wasn't staying at this hotel, I couldn't stand the situation. I was visibly upset and I even referred to the situation as ""shitty"" because that's what lazy and stupid smell like when they occupy service positions. (*In reality, you verbally assaulted our front desk agents with a volley of expletives*)   When I went to get my luggage, I got a nasty comment from one of the stupid people, ""Who told you you could go behind the counter!"" (**BECAUSE YOU STRAIGHT UP WENT BEHIND THE FRONT DESK WHILE CURSING OUT OUR EMPLOYEES, WALTZED INTO OUR BACK OFFICE, AND GRABBED YOUR BAG!**)

 SOMEONE had to get the luggage, it sure wasn't going to get into my hands with those two on duty.   Do whatever you will with my money for nothing.  The money is not important. (*good, then we will gladly keep it, asshole*)

 My dignity was offended by professional disrespect,
 &lt;probably the worst human being ever&gt;.""""




And that my friends, concludes this review. I've been at this hotel for the better part of a decade, and this definitely ranks in the top 10 of ""shittiest humans we've had in our building"" list. I sure hope he calls back to dispute his cancellation charge.....mostly because *it was an advance purchase through schmooking.com*

"I have worked at this hotel for about 6 months, the 'comfort-able hotel'. I started out in housekeeping and the owner quickly moved me to breakfast, and then to front desk. I have worked both morning and evening shift on the same schedule, and it's very common for me to work a 3-11 shift, go home and then come back 8 hours later to work 7-3.

As you can imagine, this does not leave much time to sleep once o clock out, drive home, get changed, and finally wind down. So all of the other staff knows to give me a little extra space when I first get there, because the turn and burn shifts leave me slightly less chipper until I've been up a couple hours. Anyway, today was one of those turn and burn nights.

I had been at work about 30 minutes when I got a call from a certain booking site. They were calling on behalf of a guest who was a no show three nights ago, wanting to see if we could refund the stay. Usually we are willing to work with our travel partners, so I ask why. The rep then tells me that the guest decided not to stay there because we are not pet friendly.

 Remember, I'm borderline sleep deprived at this point. I have two problems with this claim, but I kindly tell the rep that I have no authority to make these decisions (I'm just the front desk girl, no fancy title on my name tag) and that I will speak with the manager when he comes in. The rep kindly said thank you and that he would be emailing me the request and and can continue communicating that way. Sounds great.

Now, my two issues with this refund request.

1. You waited until three days after your stay to begin the process? Let's say you booked a hotel, then found out they aren't pet friendly, and you book another hotel room. Wouldn't you immediately start the process of getting the first reservation canceled? Why wait until after the stay was to be completed?


2. The website says right on it, that we are not pet friendly. Therefore, you want me to process a refund because you are too stupid to read the page? Not today buddy!



So my manager comes in about 11, by then I had received the email. I presented him with the email, and the webpage showing that this wasn't a surprise rule that she couldn't have known about. He agreed with me and denied the refund. 


I'm not gonna lie, I took a lot of pleasure typing up that refusal email.

"A simple story with a weird ending, for some weekend chillin

Starting Monday us folks at the desk will be making cookies, since we have a hard time trusting the kitchen to do it right. Often not making enough and causing guests to bitch at us for not having a cookie for them, or forgetting to make them all together. 

Today they fucked up twice. The first batch was too small, and burnt, the cookies were tough and the guests that had them weren't fans, but we put them out anyways until we could remedy the situation. 

The second batch seems to have initially been a great batch, soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside, an overall beautiful cookie, but the kitchen waited too long to bring them, and by the time they got here the cookies had fuzed in the box, creating a cookie brick. We can't give this to guests. 

And that brings me to now, sitting in the back office, slowly chipping away at a brick of chocolate chip cookies with a fork. It's beautiful, a truly transcendent experience, and I'm sure I'm going to have a headache later from all the sugar.Cookies",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I just encountered one of these people tonight. I work in a small independently owned hotel in a New England seacoast city. The ""independently owned"" part is important for later.

Our MK (Male Karen) comes to the desk around 6pm to let me know housekeeping hadn't touched his room and he is PISSED. I apologized, as I do in these cases, and got him the towels and coffee he demanded. He let me know he's a lifetime titanium super special snowflake member at Warriot, has stayed over 3000 nights in hotels and this has NEVER happened before. I told him we're independently owned and not affiliated with Warriot or any other brand hotel. He flat out told me he knows but said it to make it clear he's not happy, and then demands to find out what we're going to do for him.

MK then asks for our manager's name and when she works so I told him she'll be in on Monday and that I'd make sure she calls him. He said she'd better, and that he's not the type to not say anything during the stay and write reviews trashing places after, but if she doesn't call him Monday, he might have to do something, then left. He basically threatened to write nasty reviews online if he doesn't get some sort of compensation.

"The following just took place. I had to type up an narrative to convey my side of the story since I am off tomorrow.   


Mr. X: Guest  
Y: AGM  
Z: Chef

""Mr. X came to the front desk and approached me for a replacement key to his room because his wasn’t working. Following standard security protocol I asked him very politely if I could quickly see his ID, to confirm that he did indeed have access to the room.   
 

Mr. X did not like the fact that I was asking him for his ID and became very hostile right away. Said that he was in the Gym and didn’t have his ID. He was swearing at me saying how this isn’t right and he shouldn’t have to verify his identity for a new key, that I should know who he is. To be honest, it's just another face out of the hundreds I see a day. I only specifically remember you if you give me a reason to, good or bad.    
 

I informed Mr. X that I would have to follow him up to his room so I could take a quick look at his ID, give him the replacement key and everything would be good to go, takes just a minute or two. He then became even more irate and said that he was calling corporate and going to sue me for not giving him the key to his room. I informed him that this was for HIS protection including mine. I just can’t go issuing key cards to anyone who requests one without verifying who they are. Called Y to verify and he told me the same thing. I also gave Y’s card to him, knowing he will want to follow up.   
 

I then asked for Z to join me to follow Mr. X to his room just for my protection. The entire way Mr. X was being irate and very confrontational. I informed him politely that he needed to calm down, it would enable me to assist him better. I informed him that the threats he was making at the desk and on the way to the room were uncalled for, that if we had any further issues out of him he will be asked to leave. He then informed me that “I am not making threats, I am making a promise.” I told him “I am making a promise to you as well, if we have ANY further issues you will be asked to leave. If you don’t leave peacefully I will have you removed by the local PD. (Who Z had pre-dialed into his phone)  
 

Mr. X quickly shows me his ID, I had him the new key and tell him to have a good rest of his evening. He then mutters under his breath “fuck off fat bitch” and slams his door.  
 

As of 10:00 PM I have not had any further encounters with him and hope not to again.   


Am I in the wrong asking for ID to verify he had access to the room? I wouldn't want people just handing out key cards to anyone and everyone who asked without verification. They could then enter your room, rob you blind or even worse.

Yesterday morning at the end of my shift I get a text from GM. He is supposed to come in and work the morning shift... says he has an emergency and will be late. Sure. But that turns into 2 hours late... there’s a reason I don’t work the morning shift, I cannot deal with people coming in with their bs excuses trying to get refunded or a comped room.. I shut it down really quick... and get a bad review because of it... got 3 of those today....

When the GM did come in he apologized, I told him how the night went and I left...

Go home get to sleep and around 12 I get a call from my hhk in tears... apparently my GM worked the desk for a whopping hour. Decided he didn’t feel good and went to rest in a room and put her in charge of running the desk. on top of having to continue her duties as the head housekeeper.

On top of that our laundry attendant had a doctors appointment that was already planned, the hhk was gonna work her shift and laundry. Now she’s working 3 different jobs. 

I’m nowhere near awake to just come in so I text my evening gsr ask him if he can go in. Luckily he agrees... and gets my hhk off the desk. 

Just last week this same thing happened except my gm was scheduled to work the hhk shift, got sick and put our new hk/part time laundry attendant in charge of the hhk shift... while we were already understaffed on hk... this girl has been here a month... that night I had to have a 16 rooms down because things did not go right and I had to come in and work a 13 hour shift...

Next week I take my vacation.. I’m off for 11 days. My gm also planned his vacation at the same time and he’s gone for 15... we have a relief gm coming in but I have heard nothing about someone coming to cover my shifts... I currently work evening, audit and hhk... 

My hhk has asked me to contact hr and report the gm and I feel like I total should but idk what happens from there... I’m currently trying to contact another MOD at a different property that I k ow and get advise but I also don’t wanna be spreading shit on the wall... 

Also I don’t know it to be the case, but most of the staff suspects that gm was just hung over both times.. idk if that’s true but it’s what I’m being told.

"Here’s a story of the sad life of my translator who works with me at reception at a 4 star hotel in Thailand. He translates mainly Mandarin Chinese. He’s from Taiwan, and people from Mainland China (who mostly need the translator service because they’re not bothered to learn English/another language) don’t like Taiwan, for seemingly obvious reasons. 

Two stories, one from the perspective of the translator and one of my own nightmares.

I honestly feel really shit for the translator. He was demoted from management for poor performance, but his contract was still renewed and he still works for us. 

From us, I mostly have to call him whenever a mainlander comes to the desk and says “I need to speak chinese.” I normally say “Name, your assistance is required at the front desk.”

From there, he has to take on the tyrany of bullshit complaints, such as:

“The room is not large enough this isn’t good quality” guest paid $30 a night and got a superior room without a veranda and sea view, because... you get what you pay for

“Ridiculous demand” responded half the time with demand met or “that is a ridiculous request”

“Is this room available? Is that one? That one? That one?” When goddamn it he doesn’t have access to the Front office system to see the room grid, and all requests have to go through me.

Here’s my ridiculous story:

This is ridiculous because I thought of how irrelevant the things they said.

So these guys had made a booking for a deluxe room. For complicated reasons, we sell some “premier villas” as deluxe rooms at the same price point, with the difference being that premier villas guarantee an unobstructed sea view and easy room access.

I was walking this guy to his room and he said that he paid for a villa. I check his reservation, I said “you asked for two deluxe twins, one deluxe king.” For context he spoke the local language and worked in the country. I said to him, “look, last time you were here, you probably got upgraded but the clerk failed to inform you that you were upgraded. You paid for a deluxe room, and that’s what you’re going to get because your phone says “deluxe room” which is exactly what we’ve done for you. Last time, I think we were overbooked.” He gets all pissy about not being treated correctly. He then says “I WAS HERE LAST TIME I WORK AT THIS COMPANY” I just say (in English) “mate that’s irrelevant to the topic” and say in local language “okay sir let me speak to my manager in the reception.”

Who do I call? 

Not... ghostbusters. I called my Marketing VP, mainly because I wanted to know how much to charge them for the upgrade, and also because we both speak German, so they won’t understand my phone call. I settle it at $15 per room per night to Deluxe villa, $30 per room per night to garden view bungalow and $45 per room per night for Beach front bungalow. 

They bargained with me and played the “I work in country” card. Which I responded with “okay sir.” And he said he would send his boss here. Okay.

Honestly talk the talk all you want I won’t believe you just to save a few $$

He ended up paying a total of $270 to upgrade all his three rooms to beach front bungalows. And 5% of that is my commission. The GM really is encouraging us to upgrade customers. 

Anyways, today was a frustrating day.

Edit: I should’ve said that “if an airline overbooked economy and upgraded you, would you get all pissy at them if next time you flew with them, you paid for a crappy economy seat and got that crappy economy seat instead of the larger business class seat?”I mean, fuck the translator, right?

"::UPDATE:: Employee has been let go.  She didn't show up to work today and our GM saw her walking around downtown with her friend instead.  She definitely knew she was scheduled to work today.  Hopefully she gets her life together.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but maybe some of you have been in a similar position as me.  I'm wondering if this is really something I shouldn't be concerned about or if I should do something.

Sorry for the long post, tl;dr at bottom.

I work FD as 2nd and NA, two days each a week.  Starting last week, we hired a new housekeeper.  I'm usually not made aware of new hires since I don't handle anything in their department.  My first night of NA last week, two young girls come in and ask to rent a room.  I get both of their ID and they are both 18, which is the age we will rent to people. ( It was 21 at the last property I worked at)

I tell them the rate and confirm the one night reservation.  Girl A will be the one with the debit card, Girl B is the other.

Girl A: Oh, well Girl B is your coworker!  Shouldn't she get an employee rate?

Me: Really?  When was your first day?  Are you in housekeeping?

Girl B:  Well my first day is tomorrow in housekeeping and breakfast help.

Me: I can't guarantee you that rate for tonight since I really have no proof that you are an employee here.  Our manager can adjust it tomorrow morning though before you check out.

They didn't make a fuss, just agreed and went to their room.  I put them in a room close to the lobby.  They checked in just before midnight and the whole night, until around 5am, their door was opening and closing constantly.  I didn't hear voices or see them go out to smoke or anything, but I did see a junky car coming in and out of the parking lot at least ten times.  A younger man was driving it.

I just rolled my eyes and thought it was some young kid with their first job trying to party with her friend before work.  Besides the door slamming, they were quiet.

The next day when I arrive for NA, 2nd shift informs me that Girl B is back for the night, has the employee rate and Girl A will be staying with her.  Apparently two boys asked for their room keys and 2nd told them he wouldn't give them keys.  They were allowed to hang out with the girls, but if they stay overnight, he needed their ID to put names on the reservation and would charge the girls $10 for each extra guest staying.

They said they weren't staying and found the girls themselves.  Once again on my shift, the door was opening and closing all night. However, this time I saw a different pair of two guys, one maybe their age and one probably 30+ years older than them.  It was dark, but this guy had to be in his 40s or 50s, carrying a case of beer to the alternate entrance.  I didn't see them actually go into the room, but they were there for awhile and then they both left.

I was gone for three days and just came back yesterday on 2nd shift.  The girls come back around 7 to check in for another one day reservation.  Girl B explains that they have been getting the discount.  I look and sure enough, every day when I was gone, they had a one night reservation at the employee rate.  I asked why they keep making the reservation for one day at a time and they didn't have an answer for me.

I gave them their keys after swiping the card and signing the paper work, but this time I gave them a room farther away from the lobby.  The outside entrances on that side of the building are locked without a keycard, so if they had more visitors, they would have to let them in, or come through the lobby.

Two different boys than I've seen before show up at the desk and ask for keys to the pool.  I tell them that the pool is for registered guests only.

Boys: Well we have friends here!

Me: Oh? Do you know their room number?

Sure enough it's the two girls.  I tell them that they can hang out here for awhile in their room, but if they stay the night, we will be charging their friends per extra guest.  They said they would only be here for a bit.

An hour or so later a different guy comes to the desk and asks for a key to their room.

Me: I can't do that.  They need to let you into their room themselves.

New Boy: But I forgot some of my clothes and stuff up there!

Me: So are you staying there in the room with them?

New Boy: No, I just forgot some stuff up there. I really need to get it.

Me: Then you can contact the girls to let you in.  I can't help you.

I have a really bad gut feeling that something is going on in this room each night.  I don't want to be judgmental, but how do two 18 year old girls afford a room each night that comes to about $60 after taxes?  Girl B wouldn't have gotten paid yet, since she's only been here for a week.  Maybe Girl A is loaded and has been funding their party week?

I'm worried that they are selling drugs or themselves out of these rooms since it's always different guys coming around each night.  How would I even confront anyone about this?  Do I just keep my nose out of their business?

tl;dr  Two 18 year old girls keep staying at the hotel under the employee rate, booking one night at a time.  I've seen multiple different guys come to see them.  I'm concerned that they are selling drugs or their bodies to these creeps.  Do I say something or ignore it?Concern about employee legitimate or none of my business?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I don’t know how many times I’ve been asked this question at check-out and it fathoms me how some of these people got through school. It never fails though when the confirmation email goes through and shows their average rate per night, there’s always going to be someone complaining to me so I have to explain to them that the email said the AVERAGE rate which is the total divided by the number of days. “Oh but Saturday’s rate is so much higher than Sunday” That’s right and the average is what the confirmation email said and that you signed for at check-in. I’m not going to change your rate for you at check-out because you’re upset that different days are different rates plus you signed for the rate when you checked in and I have the signature on file.“Why is my average rate different than all of my nightly rates?”",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Honest question, we always get the same excuse asking for free cancelations via phone or chat for the same country, for bookings taking place 2 to 3 weeks after. Claiming that someone died. We can never find a way to respectfully ask if burials take that long to happen. And in my experience it is within a week.

Can anyone share some light of we are being a***s by denying free cancelations or does it actually happen?Can funerals take places 3 weeks later?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A good wholesome story! I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting weirdness. 

I work at a mid-range hotel and one of our ""things"" is having soft-baked cookies out 24/7. 

I had a pleasant interaction with some guests checking in, recommended a local pizza place to them that they seemed excited about (one of my favorite things about my city is the wealth of local restaurants) and they sent up to their room with no fuss. 

They were coming back with leftover pizza in hand as I was refilling the cookies and asked if they could interrupt my work and grab some (which is unheard of, most of the time people will either just stand there or rudely push their way past me). I happily obliged and told them the brand had pretty much ruined other cookies for me. This lady turned to me and was like, ""I think it's YOU that makes them so good!"" 

It's just a little thing but it really made my day. It's nice having proof that not everyone is a pile of garbage.Warm fuzzies",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It’s been a long time since I’ve posted here, but I’ve got a good one I think you’ll enjoy.

I do DoorDash in the side after work, a food delivery service like Favor or Uber eats.

I picked up some tacos, and it was a large order, and I saw the pay wasn’t very good for it, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, thinking they’d tip me in person.

How does this relate to this sub? I was delivering to a hotel.

I get to the room, their being loud as hell, and I have to knock a few times for them to answer. They open the door and I was basically slapped in the face with the smell of weed. I hand them the food, and they mumble a “thanks” and shut the door. 

I walk away, annoyed for what felt like a waste of time. Then on my way out, I swing by the front desk and ask, “Do you guys have smoking rooms here?” The man at the front desk said, “Absolutely not.” I smile, and give them the room number I just delivered to. The man thanked me, wrote down their room number, and I left, happy about the justice that’s coming their way.

I know they would have found out anyway, because there’s not covering that smell up, but it felt good being the one to tip them off.

"Okay so my hotel just finished renovating as part of the renovations we took the soda machine and snack machine off the 2nd floor and added a gift shop! I thought this was a great idea! Instead of guest having to use cash on the snack machine and only card on the coke machine they can either use both or even charge it to the room.

So here's the problem my F&amp;B Manager is in charge of all of the ordering for the gift shop. He went ALL IN on everything organic, gluten-free, dairy free, ect. Like I get it for a few things, it is always good to have variety for ALL GUEST. But all of this stuff is SO expensive! We have a few snacks like Candy Bars that are reasonably priced ($2) and a can of coke ($1) but those are only a few of our items we sell, here is a list of our most expensive and ridiculously priced items: 

Sparkling Water (CANS) - $3

Dr. Brew Kombucha - $8 (seriously who would buy this)

Plantain Chips (Bag the size of a small bag of lays) - $5

Dk. Choc. Covered Coconuts - $8

Moon Cheese - $6

Coconut Water/Aloe Drink - $5

Who would pay for any of this shit (sorry) but no one is expecting to get a few snacks and pay $20... I think the main thing is EVERY SINGLE DAY like half the guests that shop at our gift shop is like ""seriosuly..??"" ""8$ for Kombucha, I can get the same brand at the store for $3"" or ""wheres the nearest mini mart?""

It has just been a bigger headache then its worth.Our ""Gift Shop"" is turning into a nightmare!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My vacation is off to a bad start. There was some blowing snow in Toronto and I missed my connection. Due to weather, there was no booking until the next day. 

I am due to fly to Miami and stay in a hotel on Miami Beach for a few days before a cruise. 

I booked the Miami hotel directly through the hotel even though it was a little more due to all the stories here. 

When my flight was delayed, I called the hotel to let them know I would be a day late to hold my room. She said that since I booked direct, she can just amend my reservation and I will not have to pay for the missed day. 

Now I do not have to pay for a hotel in Toronto and Miami.

I’m so over this.. it wouldn’t be so bad if this wasn’t the SECOND time this has happened since I’ve been here.. my only other option is to go crying to one of the other hotels on the strip and pray they’re merciful.
Gonna have people checking in with key cards from a different fking hotel?? And that’s if I can get someone to give me some... which probably ain’t likely...

A- hey can I request a Dinosaur in my room

G-I’m sorry sir did you say a dinosaur

A-yes you know the things that go RAWR

G- I’m sorry but we’re fresh out of dinosaurs, but I can offer you an upgrade

A- I mean I’ll take that, but I’d really love a dinosaur, Ive traveled from Japan to Bangladesh all the way to Charlotte sc and they’ve all been able to accommodate

"For the last 6 weeks we've had a lady coming to my hotel location every week for 1 night per visit. Every time she pays in all cash, including her deposit that's required for cash paying guests. We ask for either a card to put into a 2nd folio that doesn't get holds or charges unless they break the reg. card they sign, or $100 cash deposit that we give back during check-out after the room has been inspected. My coworkers and my boss suspect she's a sex worker which isn't legal in my state, but we haven't had any hard evidence to consider reporting it yet. Their reasoning is because she always pays cash only, gives us a wrong phone number, always checks-in alone but it's clear that someone else has been in the room with her when Housekeeping come to clean the room for the next guest. My personal guess is that she's probably cheating and is giving the wrong information so that her SO doesn't find out about it. She's always checked-in on my days off so I've never seen her until today. Other then her questionable life choices, everything has been fine up until a couple weeks ago. Apparently she did some...things to her room last week, and we had a repeat of the same issue again the week before that. Here is today's visit from her

Guest: Hello, I'd like to rent a room for tonight, just use my deposit that I left here from last time for today's stay please.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am I can't do that. I was left notes here about your previous stay with us stating that you had left your room smoked in, as well as some... damage in the room.

Guest: What? Do I look like I smoke to you? I don't do any of that stuff, quick joking around and just use my deposit that I left here from last week, it should be in your drawer. (She waves her hand in the direction of our cash drawer where we would normally keep our deposits)

Me: Once again, I'm sorry but I'm not able to do that ma'am. Your previous deposit was forfeited for the smoking and damage done to the room. I'm not able to use your deposit again because your deposit is no longer here, management took your deposit and used it to deep clean and repair the damage that you caused to your room.

Guest: I'm tellin you I ain't done no damages to the room and I didn't smoke in it neither. Just use my deposit again and let me pay for my room.

Me: Ma'am, even if that was the case, your deposit isn't here, I have no deposit's waiting here for you. We don't normally keep deposits here for weeks on end because you are suppose to come to the front desk to have us inspect your room before we can give you your deposit back but the front desk notes state that you kept forgetting them here and when we made attempts to call you so that you can come retrieve your deposit back someone answers the phone and states that you gave us the wrong number and that you don't live with her and for us to remove the number from our system. Deposits aren't suppose to be carried over for the next visit, you're suppose to retrieve it from us as you leave our hotel.

Guest: That's clearly a lie, Coworker1 knows to just leave it in the drawer for me for when I come back every week.

Me: That's because Coworker1 can't contact you because you keep giving us the same wrong number. She tries to reach you in order for you to come get your deposit but since it's the wrong number we are unable to contact you.

Guest: Well I live outside of town so I just leave my deposit here each time so I don't have to keep doing it. Just call Coworker1, she knows me, she'll tell you to do this for me.

Me: Ma'am, neither Coworker1 nor I can use your deposit from last week because you smoked and damaged the room both last week, and the week before. The 1st time it happened my manager let it slide, but you repeated the same damages and smoked in the room again so she had to decline the return of your deposit to use towards fixing the issue.

Guest: You keep saying I smoked and damaged the room. I already told you, I don't smoke. What do you guys claim I damaged in the room anyways?

Me: Well, um... the notes states that both last week and the week before you smoked marijuana and peed the bed during both visits ma'am...

Guest: WHAT? This is ridiculous. I didn't piss in no bed!

Me: I'm sorry, but that's what my notes state. I only have that to go off of, I have no more say in the matter.

Guest: This is crazy, call Coworker1 so she can sort you out and get me checked-in.

Me: Coworker1 isn't a manager and neither am I so neither of us can do anything else. Only MyBoss can decide if she wants to return your deposit at this point. The deposit is no longer here and so neither myself, nor Coworker1 will be able to use it.

Guest: Well what the hell am I suppose to do then? You guys wont sell me a room any more?

Me: We can still sell you a room, but we won't be able to use your old deposit, we aren't suppose to do it that way anyways because then we would be liable if it got misplaced or missing by the time you decided you wanted it back. You're suppose to retrieve it during check-out after each visit. If you want to check into a room today, you will have to pay for the room, and leave a new deposit with us. There is nothing else I can do because it's out of my hands and only the manager can do anything for you.

Guest: Well when is she coming in? I want this sorted out and I'm not giving you guys more money for a deposit, you're going to give it back to me.

Me: She'll be here in the morning from X-Z hours. I don't know if she'll do anything for you because we are technically allowed to charge cards $250 just for smoking in the rooms but since you did cash and most aren't ok with having to pull out $250 in cash we request $100. She's already lost $150 for the smoking and damages from this event so I wouldn't keep your hopes up because since you didn't attempt to collect your deposit at check-out, she can't reexamine the room to see if your claims are valid any more because the room has since been cleaned and repaired by this time.

Guest: Well I guess we'll just have to find out and see then now won't we? I'll be making sure I call her in the morning, make sure she knows to expect my call. (she huffs and walks back out the door, I guess she decided not to stay lol)

Edit Update: Just came in for my shift and brought the guest up to my Boss Lady. She already knew the short version of yesterday but she said she read my notes. Guest is now on the DNR list so she'll have to take her cheating self out of here and try her shenanigans somewhere else. Another note, apparently this wasn't a 2nd time, but a 3rd time she's smoked and pissed the bed. Who does this shit?!?!That's not how deposits work lady...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work for a vacation rental company. We have no rooms on premise. Guests have to come to our office to get the keys

A guy and a couple come in. My coworker verifies the number of people and notices the all white, curly haired sheep dog on one of those leashes that lets the dog go wherever they want. My coworker asks about the dog.

“It’s a service dog.”

I watch the dog try to run to the counter. The woman tries to get the dog to sit. She asks it to sit and stay.It refuses to cooperate. The dog wants to greet and be loved by everyone in the lobby. So the other guy squats in front of the dog and holds its head. The dog still won’t sit and stay, but they keep him from running around the lobby. 

We sigh, and give them the key. They open the door and the dog races out of the door pulling the woman out onto the sidewalk. 

My coworker and agree that the couple are the dog’s support animals. Not the other way around. But there’s nothing we can do.“Yeah, it’s a Service Dog.”",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A lady checked in for 2 nights and has made it a point to be up until 1:30am to see me and to be awake again before 5am to come talk to me. She has not stopped being completely insane. She literally makes babbling noises as if she were speaking tongues and ""blessing"" the hotel with her bare feet. She claimes to hear 23 languages in her head at once and has been trying to convince me to let her anoint the pool naked as her native tribe would do. 

Many staff have had to make it a point to ask her not to touch their face, she was escorted out of the lobby from breakfast because she was ""blessing"" everyone's buffet breakfast with this weird gurgles and growls claiming to save the world, and being all around weird. 

She can tell I have a cold and she was nice enough to pull out a wad of tissues from her blessed gigantic boobs, sprinkle them with a bottle she whipped out of Lemon Eucalyptus, and told me Jesus woke her to come save my sinuses.

"I had a new one happen today. Someone managed to completely shut down the waffle station in the first five minutes of opening breakfast.

Some time ago, like 6 years, our brand added waffle makers and such to the line up. I hated it then, and I hate them now. It's a mess to prepare, maintain and clean up after... especially with groups of kids.

That said in the last six years I've never had someone TWIST OFF THE VALVE instead of pressing the lever. Resulting in a full container of batter going all over the station, cabinet and floor. So no less than five minutes after opening we have to ask people to wait while we clean up the colossal mess created by this tactical genius. 

Maybe I'm just venting... but I thought in 16 years I had seen it all, and yet tourists continue to show me new and exciting things at my own property. That said I'd take the fact I now smell like waffle batter over other things....For the love of waffle",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"Working a 3-11 shift, lady comes in with a local address to check in, has no suite case, just the clothes on her back. And, is super high on SOMETHING, not pot, but SOMETHING I want nothing to do with. Due to policy, I had to check her in. I hate you policy. I checked her in.

It was feeding time for our fish Nate, lovely fish, and not even ten minutes of checking in, she is at my front desk banging on the counter. I come around the corner, I am holding his fish food in my hand. She asked for an extra key and I said of course, I went behind the wall, that separates the front desk area from our offices, to put the fish food down. I come back out and the lady was almost behind my desk. I told her to not cross the line we have, and to please respect our space. She said she wanted to see our fish......no? I told her no she cannot see my fish, this is an employee only area. She got offended by this? Like lady it's a fish, he is my fish, I love my fish, you cannot see my fish! Also, I know you are trying to steal something or snoop, I am not stupid! 

She walks off, I walk behind the wall to feed my fish, I come back out, and guess who is almost at my computer trying to look through my shit? I told her to step out away from the desk, and if I see her behind my desk one more time, she will be removed from the property. She got offended by this again and said fine, she left for about two hours. 

It got to the end of my shift, she came back to the hotel, I was talking to my co workers explaining she kept trying to get behind the desk earlier, and that she knows if she does it again we will remove her from the property. I leave the building, and I see her standing outside smoking, and I walked to my car and she started to slowly follow me. She was crouching down and following me. Like lady what are you doing? I stopped and asked her what the heck she was doing, and she told me to have a good night while walking towards me. I got in my car quickly, locked my doors, took my mace gun out, started my car and she was starting to look into my car through the window. I quickly backed up and drove off, I called my co workers and let them know what just happened. 

The following morning, I received a text from my co worker complaining about the woman. I asked what happened, she explained the night auditors left notes stating to not let her extend again, she was acting very odd all night. She also tried to extend through my co worker, and policy is we HAVE to see ID and credit card before extending, and the card must authorize for the full amount + some. My co worker told her she has to come down and extend, she said she also has ten minutes to do so because it was an hour past check out. She assumed we would just extend her. Of course, the card did not run, co worker told her she has ten minutes to either provide payment for another night or leave. She was purposely not leaving the room all morning.

I then called my GM and explained to her what the woman did, how she followed me to my car and kept trying to get behind the desk, the in and out foot traffic of sketchy people, her becoming aggressive and rude with our co worker. She said we couldn't kick her out or prevent her from extending as long as we have a card that authorizes and is valid. I told her we should not extend her, she is on drugs, she is going to do something to that room, something is going to happen. Nope, did not listen to me! 

I then got a text from my co worker saying the ladies mom sent over a credit card authorization form. Lovely! I worked the 3-11 again, an hour later into my shift, the lady comes up and complains about my co worker ""making"" her provide ID and credit card.................I explained to her that it is policy. She did her job. She then brought in a man, very sketchy and odd man. That was the last time I saw her for the rest of the night. At the end of my shift though, a sketchy man came in with a ripped up trash bag, I said hello to him and asked what room he was going to. He ignored me and ran off, he locked himself in the mens bathroom. I waited for my co workers to get in to help me get his ass out, when they came, we went over and banged on the mens bathroom door and kicked him out. He drove off in a very sketchy van parked in the back of the parking lot. I am not sure if that guy was associated with the lady or not, but when he left that bathroom, he did not have that ripped up trash bag? It was sketch. 

Night auditors that night received a lovely visit from the police between 2am and 3am. The police handed them a warrant for the sketchy odd man the lady brought in earlier, they had the room number and all, along with her name because she was associated with him. Night auditors said have at it and handed them the front desk keys in case they had to force themselves into the room. Night auditors said they could hear a struggle from the room, and then they brought the man down in cuffs. They said at 6am he walked back in after getting arrested? We aren't completely sure what happened with that.

The next morning, they came down to extend, GM extended and talked to the woman herself. The woman got VERY rude with my boss and got offended we required another credit card authorization from for the correct dates. 

She said her mom called to extend it, the mom never did.

She said WE, the front desk staff, called her mom to ask if we can extend for her, HELL NO WE DIDN'T 

She said we already extended her but decided to take it back, NEVER HAPPENED LADY

My boss did extend her for her and informed her none of that never happened, and that her staff would never do that. She snatched everything away from my boss aggressively, her mom did send an updated credit card authorization form, and as soon as my boss got that, and as soon as the lady left for the day, my boss went into the room to inspect it. 

Room was trashed. Drug pipes everywhere, meth in the sink, black burnt meth on the counters, burnt foil, destroyed towels, old food everywhere, clothes in the trash can, also covered in burnt meth. For some odd reason there was a pink childrens bow and children clothes in the room? There was never a child in the room. I was at school that day, and I got texts asking if I ever saw a kid in the room, if I ever saw anybody come visit her with a kid, because that was the most alarming thing. If a kid was ever in that room, and she was smoking meth the whole time, my boss said she will be calling child protective services to have them investigate all of that. She is currently still watching security footage from the start of her stay to the end to see if a kid went in there at all. But, all of that explained her mood swings and aggression. 

We were supposed to tell her to get her crap and leave when she came back from wherever that day, we tried to call her, but she gave a fake phone number. She never came back though, didn't even call to see about getting her stuff. Just went POOF. I think they realized we were going to kick them out.

I told my boss she was going to do something to the room or something would happen. But nooooooooo nobody LISTENS TO ME, I am not sure why she even extended after somebody associated with the woman was arrested, police had a warrant, woman was on the warrant, just why extend even if that went down? They clearly wanted him for something, she was involved in some form, KICK THEIR ASSES OUT RIGHT THEN AND THERE. But no.I TOLD YOU SO",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So ride sharing apps came into my area a few years ago, which caused most people to switch over to them rather than using the preexisting taxi companies. This caused all but one of the taxi companies to go out of business and the one that is left is notoriously unreliable.

The problem is that most of the ride sharing drivers only work during peak hours, namely hours where businesses or bars are open. If you need a ride in the early hours of the morning there's no longer any options available to you around here.

This is a problem because the local airport just expanded its hours to allow earlier flights so we have a bunch of guests showing up at the desk at 4am in the morning in a total panic about not having a ride to get to their 5am flight. My hotel has a shuttle but the shuttle drivers are still scheduled around the previous airport hours and our owner has proved unwilling to approve extra hours to their schedule.

Its just been a mess from every angle.(Rant) Ride Sharing killed off the taxi companies and now nobody is willing to fill the void they left",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guest has apparently never been asked to provide a credit card at any hotel ever. They booked online and had to put a card on file, never called the hotel to say the company was putting the guest up there or filled out a credit auth, but boy did they have a confirmation email so that should mean it was paid for. Had to make sure we knew that we’re the only place ever to require that and that they wouldn’t be staying with us again.

"Our bellman no-call no-showed for his last 3 shifts, which is wildly out of character. All of us are worried about him and have been calling his emergency contacts.

&amp;#x200B;

One finally called back today, saying the last time he'd seen our bellman was when he left for work on Monday morning. He never showed up for that shift. I don't know what happened to him, we're going to try calling around to different hospitals to see if he's been admitted, but other than that we're not sure what the next steps should be.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I need ideas. Our bellman is the sweetest elderly man I've ever met and I just want to know he's okay. I've never known anyone first hand that's become a missing person before. Any ideas?

2/28 Update: we visited the shelter and found out our bellman has been something of a spokesman for that shelter, being one of their biggest success stories. His face is all over their newsletters. But the bad news is nobody has seen him still, and his personal belongings are still there, minus his phone, which, when called, goes straight to voicemail. Our next step is to head to the police station and see if we can get them to track the last tower his phone pinged off of.

The shelter thinks he might have relapsed, or been attacked, as the shelter is not in that great of a neighborhood. Local police stations don’t have him, hospitals don’t have him or a “John Doe”. One of our sales team members had the morbid idea of calling local mortuaries to see if anyone has been dropped off or found. But I think we’re all too afraid to do that.I just hope he's okay.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

CrazyLady:  Hi, I'm looking to book a room from Friday night until Saturday.  And it has to have a hot tub in it.

(Now, I'm new to the industry.  But as far as I'm aware, this isn't really a thing.  Like, a fully treated, chlorinated, hot tub...in a guest room.  I assume she means jacuzzi tub.)

Me: Okay, miss, I can see that we do have Jacuzzi suites available that weekend, the price is--

CrazyLady: No, not a jacuzzi.  A hot tub.  In the room.

Me: I...we...don't have that?

CrazyLady: What do you mean you don't have rooms with hot tubs in them?

Me: I mean that we don't have rooms with hot tubs in them.  We have Jacuzzi tub rooms, with jetted tubs, though.  Those come standard with all of our Designer Suites.

CrazyLady: Well, FINE.  What's the price on that then?

(It is a rather high price, as it is a designer suite that there are only, like, 6 of in the hotel, usually for Honeymoons and stuff.)

Me: The rate for our Designer Suites that weekend is $xx.xx, is that okay for your rate, miss?

CrazyLady: WHAT?!

Me: ...the rate for a room with a jetted bathtub this coming weekend is $xx.xx, miss.

CrazyLady: Well, I think that's a bit high for just a room, don't you?

Me: I am not permitted to comment, miss.  I know that we only have 4 rooms that weekend with bubbler systems, and they are all $xx.xx.

CrazyLady: *growls audibly* Well, there's two of [[my company]] in the city, right?

Me: Indeed, miss, you could certainly check with our sister property to see what their availability is like.  Their phone number is **********.

(She hangs up.  Has the same conversation with my friend the NA at the other hotel in town, except this time she says that she's lost her son recently, and why can't she have a room for half off?  Other NA also clarifies that there is no hot tubs in his rooms either.  She then calls every hotel in the city, looking for rooms with hot tubs in.  Then calls my sister location back, telling the other NA that it's 'just ridiculous' that nobody has hot tubs in the room.  In case it matters, we're a little city.  Population 40,000.  At this stage she asks other NA for his rate on a normal room.

Then, she calls me back.)

*Phone rings*

Me: Hello, thank you for calling the ********, my name is OP, may I start with your name please?

CrazyLady:  Hi, we just spoke, my name is CrazyLady?

Me: Ah, yes, good to hear from you again.  How can I help.

CrazyLady: *sighs dramatically* Can you tell me the rate on a normal room, with a bathtub?

Me: Certainly, miss, the rate is ... $xx.xx for that weekend.  How does that sound for a rate for you?

CrazyLady: *sounding exasperated*: It's just.  When I was there a few years ago, I got a MUCH better rate.  Like, basically half that.

Me: I see, well I'm sorry about that, but--

CrazyLady: I just hate it when things change like that, right from under you.  *Dramatic sigh*.  Where are you again, you're the location across from the K-Mart, right?

(At this point, I stifle a laugh.  There has not been a K-Mart in my city in 10-15 years.  Finally, her half-remembered rate is beginning to make sense.)

Me: Ahh, yes.  Across from the Safeway and the Liquor Store, by the Dollarama there.  I think you'll find that the K-Mart is no longer there, sadly.

CrazyLady: Now, you have a pool and a hot tub outside, right?

Me: They are indoor, in the property, miss.

CrazyLady: But not in my room.

Me: No, miss.

CrazyLady: Because, I mean, GOD FORBID there be a freakin' hot tub in my room, right?

(At this point I'm losing my patience.  I've been on vacations to the Dominican, to Spain, to Vegas, to London, never have I heard of this concept.)

Me: Well, you know miss, I've never seen that myself.  Personally.  But maybe one day we'll have a room for you with a hot tub in it.  Maybe one day.

CrazyLady: Hrmmff.  ... So you said the rate was $xx.xx?  Is that with tax?

Me: Actually, no, miss.  With tax, the price is $xx.xx, per evening.  Is that still okay?

CrazyLady: *tuts* I just can't believe that your rate is twice what I paid a few years ago.

Me: Well, miss, a lot has changed in the past ten years or so.

CrazyLady: *clearly about to say something*--

Me: Now, I believe I have all your details, I've got you arriving on Friday, leaving on Saturday, at a rate of $xx.xx.  Would you like to leave a credit card to hold your reservation at this time, miss?

CrazyLady: ... ... ... ... ... ... I'll put it on a Visa, the number is...

----+----

TL;DR: Lady, possibly from the future, insists on a room with a fully treated and heated hot tub in it.  She wishes to pay for that room according to rates used fifteen years ago.  
I sold her a room anywhoo, but boy-howdy we had fun getting there.

EDIT: Omfg, after all that, she calls and cancels the room 3 hours later.  🤦 Supposedly her sister is absolutely freaking out, doesn't want her to come here, doesn't want her to come to the city at all.  Super paranoid, according to CrazyLady.

"This is my second post of the day and my shift still isn't over.

Just got a phone call that went like this. 

ME: ""Hello this is The Hotel Inn, how can I help you?""

Guest: ""I'm a former director of sales at the Schmilton Inn, whats your lowest rate on March 9th?""

ME: ""Well it looks like that would be our Two Queen bedroom at the rate of $129.99""

Guest ""I'm the former director of sales like I said, what is your occupancy on that date then?""

ME: ""Well it looks like we are a little over 50% on that date""

Guest: ""Okay so you can lower the rate for me""

ME: ""Sir the absolute lowest I can do for you is $119.99""

Guest: ""Seriously? What the hell are you guys doing over there?""

ME: ""Okay sir, the rate will be $129.99. Your former hotel has no business involving us at all and you have been far too rude for me to want to help you out, have a great day, goodbye.""

"So, despite having nearly two years experience in the industry and currently working at a hotel that accepts cash payments for rooms (with a $100 deposit), I’m not used to denying entry to walk-ins. In fact, tonight was one of the only times I’ve done so.

It was shortly after I started working at about 11:30 and I had just finished my beginning of the night tasks. I was sitting there at my computer, relaxing, when a car pulled up. For some reason, people like to pull up past my entrance, which annoys me, though I can at least see the cars through the reflection in the window.

A few seconds later, a guy walks in. Something about him seems very seedy, as if he’s covered in red flags. He was bald with a bandanna around the top of his head and his face was covered in tattoos. The only ones I remember were the runes, which was interesting. Okay, I respect people for their lifestyle choices, though not many places would hire people with that many tattoos on. He also smelled of tobacco smoke.

Pretty much immediately, I didn’t want to rent a room to him, but I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully he didn't give off too many red flags.

Me (smiling with a chipper voice): Good evening. You have a reservation?

Walk-in: Hi, I was looking to rent a room.

Me: Okay. You want one bed or two?

I started looking up the room prices.

Walk-in: Just one is fine. Hey, so most of the night is already over. Could I get a room through tomorrow night and only have to pay for tomorrow night?

Need I remind you it was only about 11:30? The guy just handed me another red flag.

Me, the smile fading: Unfortunately, I can’t really do that.

Walk-in: You didn’t run the audit yet, did you? When do you do that? I can come back then.

Me: I run it at about 4:00am. Keep in mind, if you check in before 10am, there’s a $35 early check-in fee.

Walk-in: Okay, I’ll come in then.

Then he left. At that point, I hoped he would find another hotel to stay at. Keep in mind what I said at the beginning about how I don’t really like telling people they can’t stay at my hotel. I know, some people lie and say they’re sold out. I don’t like doing that, unfortunately. It makes me really uncomfortable. Time passed and I hoped he wouldn't show up.

Alas, that was not to be. Shortly after 4, my audit is done and I’m doing my post-audit work (just room racks for housekeeping). Lo and behold, I see a familiar car that I hoped wasn’t his.

He walks in.

Walk-in, pulling out a huge wad of cash (big red flag): So, the total will be about $130?

Me, lying despite not wanting to: Unfortunately, at this time of night, we have to take credit card.

Walk-in: So, if I just go and put this on a card, you’ll take it?

Me, feeling very uncomfortable: I guess.

He got an irritated expression on his face.

Walk-in: You just don’t want me staying here, don’t you? (He started to leave) What’s your manager’s name again?

I felt even more uncomfortable, but I tell it to him. He walked out and drove off, leaving my hotel behind.

To be honest, I probably didn’t handle it particularly well and the guy’s probably going to complain to my boss. Oh well. He was waving red flags, anyway, particularly the parts about wanting to stay the first night for free (someone else tried that before. I didn’t budge), waiting four hours for a room despite there being numerous other hotels in my area (was he kicked out of all the other hotels?), wanting to pay in cash and having a huge wad of it, and smelling of smoke. The face covered in tattoos was only a start. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was a local too, which would have been yet another red flag. Hopefully, I don’t get downvoted too much for this.My Idiotic Attempt at Refusing Service to Someone Covered in Red Flags",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Omg. I have so many stories from my last hotel job but not enough patience and time to write them out. Let's just say the new owners claimed to own hotels in another country yet their actions proved otherwise. Hiring someone with no GM, manager, hotel, anything experience. 

That GM hired someone to be his assistant who also knew nothing. And not assistant manager but just his assistant. They then hired people, all of the same race, for the back office. Payroll,  ""hr"" sales. None of them knew what they were doing. They had us, the front desk, take their mandatory training for our brand hotel. When we would mention something was a brand standard &amp; we had to do it, we would get into trouble for ""talking back"" or not obeying orders. 

Finally the brand deemed the hotel unfit to carry the name so we had to make changes. They hired people to do renovations but when it wasn't happening fast enough and the owners didnt want to pay more money, they brought us in. We were moving furniture out of the hotel, taking down wallpaper, taking out carpet. The whole shebang. 

I was told I was getting a promotion but when they wouldn't pay me my overtime (some weeks I was working 7 days a week- while the hotel was shut down for renovations), I stood my ground. I showed them the states laws, printed it out for them. They got mad &amp; demoted me instead of my promised promotion.

 Oh yeah, we had to close for renovations &amp; they had us calling every guest for three months to cancel their reservations. And then when the first 3 months were gone, we had to do it again. Over &amp; over for a year. Halfway thru there weren't computers or phones turned on in the hotel so they had us in the motel they owned next door, calling from our cell phones. 

That's the jist of it but there is so much more from that hellhole. Eventually when we opened back up, I quit. A year later, the brand came to their senses &amp; stopped giving them more time to fix it all &amp; took away the brand name.Hellhole",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have worked night audit for almost 2 years at this hotel and have had nothing even close to this ever happen to me. Luckily the situation wasnt near as bad as it could have been.

I let this sketchy looking guy in through our front door around 12 tonight. Even though we were sold out I don't like to question people because guests can get super offended if I ask their info through a locked door. And this is generally not a dangerous area. Immediately I know I have made a mistake because he isnt going to his room he is looking for the bathroom. I figure whatever,  hopefully he will use the bathroom and go away. He is in there for a few minutes and I dont want some random person loitering in the middle of the night so I go to see what's up. I go to the bathroom and it looks like hes just finishing up and actually was washing his face and some of his hair too. We leave the bathroom and he says he needs a towel so I'm like ok it's in the bathroom and I go to show him. So he gets a paper towel and dries off but then he decided hes going to sit on the sink counter and I start getting frustrated so I'm like ok man its time to go but he doesnt budge and just keeps fucking around. Then out of the fucking blue this guys like ""hey look at this"" and he pulls out a fucking gun and points it at my face for a second in this kind of  nonchalant manner and then goes to put it away. Immediately I'm like NOPE and just walk the fuck out of there to our back office that is protected by a fire door and I call the cops. I wait a few minutes..hear him leaving through the front door..wait a little longer and poke my head out to see him being cuffed by the police within view of our entrance doors. After talking to the police I had to go out and physically tell him he was banned from the property and he started yelling shit at me when I was walking away.

What a wild fucking night I have been considering getting pepper spray and will definitely do that now. I dont think the guy had any intention of actually doing anything but if you point a fucking gun at someone theres going to be consequences.

"So I'm quitting this place in a few days while I fix the job that I have lined up because they treat me like a manager and HR when I'm just a mere Front Desk.

Him: ""Can you charge this to my room? I'm in 2160.""

Me: ""That's too many numbers.""

"I work at the front desk in an upscale hotel. Most of our guests are business travelers, so our hotel tends to be very quiet. So about 2 months ago, I let the other FD agent go home early.  It was around 930 pm and the lobby was empty so I was just messing around on my phone. At one point a lady walks in, stops right after she stepped into the building, she looked pretty dazed so I just assumed she was drunk. 

She comes to the front desk and leans pretty close to me. She whispers ""hey, my heart is pumping really hard, I think I'm having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance for me"" 
Right as she started speaking, a very strong weed smell punched me right in the nose. Right away I knew what was going on. 

I grabbed a chair from the back, had her sit down, gave her some water and called 911 for her. Phone call was fine, I have first aid and CPR certifications so I knew what to tell the lady on the phone. We are also not too far from the fire station so it didnt take them more than 4 minutes to arrive. And OH BOY was I ready for this. 

Right away, they have her attached to a heart monitor and asked her questions. I grabbed one of the firemen and told him that most likely she was just high as fuck. If you dont know, southern California weed is WAAAY stronger than in most other places. I apologized for wasting their time but I had to make the call. At this point even the paramedics knew what was up. She stunk like weed soooo bad. 

They double checked with her that she wanted to take that (very expensive) ride to the hospital. She said yes, so they took her with them. I went home that night and I didnt hear anything about it when I came back the next morning from anyone from the morning shift. 

Later that evening, she comes in the door. She looks at me and you could literally see the shame on her face. I say hi and asked her if everything was fine. At this point she told me that she had smoked some weed on her way back to the hotel, she didnt believe our weed was that strong because ""she had been smoking for years"". Keep in mind she was coming from a state where weed is still illegal. 

She mentioned that on the way to the hospital, the paramedic was scolding her for smoking too much and wasting people's times. She said she couldn't wait to just go back home and forget about all of this. I'm sure she wont forget that medical bill anytime soon.Guest visited California, gets high as a kite.

"Last night, we had a guest email me and my general manager stating he never coming back to our hotel and will be giving us a bad rating because our TV's defaulted to CNN once they are turned on.  He then gave 20 instances where CNN had been accused, or proven, to broadcast false information.  He obviously copied and pasted it because the email would have been 3 pages if we printed it out.  
Nothing was wrong with our product or services... but the TV channel pissed him off in a big way.

Ugggg.  Really?  I shot back an email stating we would investigate whether this was a brand standard.  It turns out a default to a major news network is a brand standard, but not the actual channel.  We also found out it would cost $200+ to change the defaults in our 90 room hotel.  I updated him stating we would change to the Weather Channel.   There is a 99% chance we will not due to the expense.  Dude was a first time guests with a company that have never stayed here before.  What an ass.Guest is freaked out by CNN",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I was working my graveyard shift as I always do, almost midnight. 23.30pm, a room calls me to complain about a room above them - apparently there's a whole lotta stomping and running and people just plain being loud. The curfew or whatnot here during wintertime is 11pm so they were supposed to be quiet in the room above.

I go there and sure enough I can hear children screaming and running around and people talking loudly - they seemed tipsy as well. I knock on the door and the kids open the door (who, mind you, I think shouldn't even be awake at this point because they're like 5 and younger and it's 1 celsius outside they might get cold or whatever answering the door). I tell the room that I've received a complaint and it's curfew and they have to try and tone it down a bit now. They tell me okay and that's that.

Until an hour and a half later this man comes to the reception with a child(maybe his?), smelling of beer and starts yelling at me, the child is crying.

**DC - drunk cunt**  
**Me - me (lol)**

DC: Why would you do this? Why would you come and tell us our that our family was loud?

Me: Sir, you were being a bit too loud for the room below you and your children were running around therefore not letting them sleep. They have not called me back since so it's all fine now.

DC: Well why don't you put families with children on the first floor?  
Me: Because you wanted your rooms to be close together and the rooms on the first floor are all booked out at the moment.  
DC: My wife has ran away now, we got into a huge dispute over this!!

Me: I am sorry to hear that, but you need to be considerate of other guests as you are in this hotel with other people.  
DC: We came here to relax and enjoy our time off and now you and that room ruined it for us.  
Me: Yes, but that doesn't mean that you can be inconsiderate of other guests and be loud after curfew, you need to respect the laws aswell.  
DC: Well, the room below me was loud too, what if I tell you that??  
Me: The room below you is asleep already, sir.

DC: I am going to need some compensation from you.

Me: I do not have authority to give you any money. You need to contact the sales department for any refunds or anything regarding compensation.

DC: What if I leave tonight and don't e-mail the sales department, I don't want to e-mail them.

Me: Then you will not receive any compensation nor any money back if you leave. I suggest you go back to your room.

"Okay so, backstory. I work at a really bad hotel. Like I get paid more then most of the luxury hotels because the type of stuff I have to deal with. Lately it’s been pretty calm. I love my job. I love my little ghetto AF hotel. I like a good majority of the guests. 

So Karen is staying with us... Karen is a homeless “ex” junkie (not saying that to be a d bag, that’s her self description) she comes in fairly often and I’ve always had minor issues with her but nothing crazy. 

Occasional late payment.. no more then an hour. Noise complaints. One time she booked through and OTA and had a mental breakdown when she realized it woulda been cheaper to book with us directly and flipped it when she realized she already paid a non refundable to the OTA. Claimed that the 4 or 5 dollars was gonna mean the difference between her sleeping on the streets and getting another night. So, we hospitality adjusted it.. I ain’t gonna worry bout it... overall I try to be as helpful and considerate as I possibly can within policy limits.

Today she got a room, and the toilet backed up.. understandably inconvenient... she called and I immediately apologized and tried ensured her I would get her into a new room and immediately got cut off.

“Do you realize how incredibly inconvenient this is for me! How dare you put me in a room where the toilets gonna back up on me! $!?&amp;@!&amp;”
Okay... wow we’re going there already?
I apologize again and try getting her to come up to the FD so I can get her moved and she’s still spouting off calling me names and everything so I start going through and remarking the account.. look up all my other coworkers remarks on her and check the check in time. She’s still yelling so finally I hit her with the
“Look, I’m sorry that this happened, there is absolutely no reason for you to be yelling at me. If you come to the front desk I’m gonna go ahead and give you a full refund for the room. And you can contact the OTA you booked through and they will arrange other accommodations for you at the cost of our property.” 
Basically.. the nicest way I could tell her I’m over her shit and to Eff off...

This then turns into the 
“So now your trying to kick me out?”
No Karen... I tried to get you into a room with a working toilet and you wanna cuss me out and make personal attacks clearly anything I do is gonna set you off so I’ll bite the bullet just to not have to hear from you the rest of the night..

She comes down, demanding that I refund her in cash and I’m straight up like 
“No, not happening, it’ll be refunded to the original payment method.”
She doesn’t want to understand that and I have a guest who walks into the lobby
Listening to everything and she chimes in
“No buisness can refund to a different payment method, if you pay cash you get cash if you pay card it goes back to the card”
Karen didn’t like that... I kinda did it was nice..
So Karen goes off on the guest and they get into a back and forth. I get the guest out of the lobby and as she leaves, 
“sorry you have to deal with all the druggies out here hope your night gets better” love ya gurl! ❤️❤️

Basically talk Karen down she finally settles for a room move. Cool, I ain’t gotta deal with her no more.
The room move took her approximately an hour.. to move 4 bags... and a dog? She kept mixing up the room keys and would keep coming down to the FD accusing me of “hitting the button that makes her doors not open to mess with her”
I WISH THERE WAS SAID BUTTON!
explain that she’s mixing the keys up so I make new ones, get a sharpie write the number of the old room on the key and leave the new room blank.. obviously I don’t want her to throw a key down with the room number and someone get in so I’m watching the cameras waiting to go lock that down room out...

Manager texts me randomly asking how the nights going.. explain everything to him and I get hit with the 
“She’s phishing for a room and you gave it to her!?!”
No... she said there was an issue with the original room, I moved her and made her aware that I could either give her a full refund and she could go somewhere else or I could move her and that’s that.
“You comped her a room!?!”
No........ room 1 had issue... moved her to room 2.. 

manager comes in about  30 minutes later.. furious because I’m “handing out rooms for free”... 
wtf??? I explain to him once again everything that happened... from the texts that I sent him...
“Oh.. okay, so it’s handled.. why didn’t you say that?”
Like omg wtf I’m even is this place... My vacation cannot come quick enough...Omg... Karen and GM are both idiots...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"You read that right. I had a guest come to the desk this morning wondering why his rate changed from Monday to Tuesday (not totally unusual), and I explained it was due to our occupancy, whats available, etc.

He became very upset at that, so I pulled up his reservation expecting to see that we had manually made it for him and forgotten to tell him the rate was going to change, but nope, he literally made the reservation himself through a travel agent. I told him the agent would tell him the room rate for each night, and he right away blurted out ""No! No! It definitely didn't!"" 

So I then asked, ""but it did inform you of the total of your stay correct?"" and he said yes it did. I told him that despite the rate changing, he was still paying the exact same price. Instead of paying $140 for each night, he was paying $160 for the first night, and then $120 for the second night. I explained this in the simplest terms I could think of, and all he had to say was that he was never staying here again and was going to a different property.

I wished him a great day and just couldn't help but laugh.Upset because the rate changed, even though the total stayed exactly the same.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I made a mistake. My old hotel is in shutdown and I've taken a job as a task force DOS for a different company. I happen to be in town this week and I'm still friends with my old coworkers.  
  
So we go and get dinner and she tells me she needs to swing past the hotel to see whether or not the nightime employees are even there. These particular employees used to be friends of mine, no more after the other night.   
  
She calls me up and tells me they couldn't be found, the phone wasn't getting answered, and the doors were unlocked (hotel in shutdown and a handful of their televisions walked out.)  
  
I decided to take a walk because they live about 100 feet away from me in the same apartment complex. I can clearly see both of them through the window playing xbox. I figure I'll be nice one last time and I knock on the door and tell them, ""btw, they suspect you both of cutting out mid shift. Be real careful if you keep doing this. Right now you're being paid to make sure the construction crews didn't prop open doors and to watch netflix.""  
  
Then I left, it was like 8pm or so this happened.   
  
I told my friend I saw nothing and went to bed. Then I get a message the next day about how they went to the GM claiming my friend ""sicked"" me on them and how it was harassment, essentially admitting I caught them red handed.  
  
I'm still contemplating proper vengeance.  I warned them and they try to turn it against the person that was doing their job.   
  
To my knowledge they both were suspended and earned an enemy of me. And when I say we used to be friends, I mean I bought them a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue on their last birthday.

I imagine due to our availability, this was the best room for you. The suites we have are not the bed type you requested originally, you would be right by the elevator and facing traffic (we already knew not to bother about the upgrade and told her we didn't have any, at check in). I have taken a look to see what room I could transfer you to, BUT none would be on the 4th floor."" -Me

""Oh well I wouldn't want that room and I don't want to move from the top floor. I also will be checking out at 5 am so it would be a waste. I appreciate your time."" *Click* -LW

I would have felt a lot worse about this situation if it WAS me who put this lady in a connecting room. (I personally am not a fan of connecting rooms, and I'm not even a _____ member.) Except it really did happen because this room is literally considered one of our location's ""better"" rooms 💀

This is the first of this situation for me. And our entire place.

"It always seems like drunk guests reveal their most unflattering sides of themselves, so here is a story of such an interaction. I've worked in hotels at the front desk for over 3 years so I have my fair share.

The first hotel I worked at was on a college campus, so we were commonly booked out with guests arriving to watch football games. Of course, these guests are never just here to watch a football game, they're also here to tailgate and go to bars. Some people would start tailgating as early as 7 in the morning, so they were constantly drinking all day. It doesn't help that in our city there was many bars directly on campus, which were about a 5 minute walk from a hotel. So many guests checked in already hammered on football nights.

A lady and what I assumed to be her husband come to check in at night. I assume the lady is in her late 30s or early 40s, I guess I could have known from checking her ID but I don't normally pay attention to the age when I'm checking guest's IDs. So I'm checking her in, and she proceeds to tell me that I look handsome and so I blush then say thank you. Then she proceeds to tell me that ""I can sleep in her bed tonight"" after which I blush even harder and awkwardly and uncomfortably laugh. Mind you, this was with what I assume to be her husband standing right next to her. THEN she proceeds to ask me if I'm specifically *17 years old,* to which I respond ""No, I'm 23 years old"" and I proceed to be totally creeped out and confused. Then the guest left me alone after that and I didn't hear back from her.An unflattering tale of a drunken guest.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm about to leave this branche behind for a different job in a whole different branche. Tonight one guest did something that was just the cherry on top of the cake of me being happy I am leaving. In the midst on an outbreak there is still a guest coughing right in my face, then laughing it off about how he didn't have the corona virus. 

Yeah pal, great for you but do you mind not coughing in my face?!  :|''Oh don't worry it's not Corona.''",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A Karen in the wild appeared a few days ago. She was nice,for the most part, until she was given ""no"" as an answer.

When she was on her last stay, using her own card, she brought me her company card and said that she needs to make sure that this is on her reservation for the next night, since she would be staying one more day, on company time. 

Not a big deal, as we have had their company here many *many* times before. I go to look her reservation up, and notice that it is nowhere to be seen. I inform her that while I can create this reservation, she needs to have the company she works for send me the appropriate CC Authorization form. 

This is where she got sour and told me that she should already *have* a reservation, and that I need to just take the card. I inform her that under no circumstance will anyone at this hotel take that card without an Authorization sent to us. She raises her voice in that all too familiar manner and tells me, verbatim, ""This is *ridiculous!* No one else has *ever* made me give them that form! I want that room set up *now!*""

With a slightly raised voice, full of DETERMINATION, I asserted my meager dominance over the wild Karen and ~~threw a pokeball~~ firmly told her that I can not accept it legally. She ended up storming off, muttering under her breath about talking to my manager, before stepping into the elevator and leaving.

 I told my GM what happened, and since they are still a bit new to how we do business with this company, I told them what we require. The next night (I'm on Audit), I was talking over the day's information with 2nd shift, and I get this extreme pleasure of seeing that we contact her company, and they *declined* to pay for her room. Needless to say, she was more polite to me this morning upon checkout, having learned her lesson through paying another chunk of her own money to stay with us.Just a short visit from a Karen",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I worked 3p-11p last night. It was just a weird day. It started when some Greek guests checked in. They said they were here for their anniversary. The husband immediately says asks what we're going to do for them. I'm standing there blindsided and a bit offended that it's my responsibility to stroke their ego. Whatever. The boss was standing right there. She wrote a note, and we're probably going to do a gift card and bottle of wine for them. Anyways, they come back down about 2 hours later asking for dinner recommendations. I frown slightly because I never eat out, and that's my least favorite question. The wife immediately grabs the managers card. Great.
Next, a construction group thats been staying at the hotel... one of their guys broke his phone screen, and I spent an hour playing technician trying to help him get data transferred to the new phone, because I've got a little bit of experience doing that.
The last thing that happened that sort of ticked me off... a guest calls down from his room angry about the wifi. I immediately try to assist him getting his laptop set up to the internet so he can watch a movie, and he doesn't let me get more than 5 words in. He swears up and down, then says ""f*** this"" and hangs up.

When I first started in hotel, within 2 weeks I'd had my first call to the police over a guest threatening to use their handgun on another guest. That drunk (gunless) guest was easier to interact with than the people I dealt with last night. It really irritates me how peoples kid mode turns on as soon as they walk into a hotel. No logic, no reasoning, they just shut their brains off when they walk through those doors. Can the guests look for their own dinner recommendations? Yeah! They're 80. They've eaten at more restaurants in more countries on this planet than I have. They've got smart phones, but no, they're lazy and entitled. Construction guy won't listen when I say, ""your screen is broken, and this isn't going to be an easy fix, you'll need a technician"" and wifi guy won't calm down long enough to let me fix his problem.

Anyways, I get home and go to bed. The whole night, I'm dreaming about those same guests, and this time they're coming behind the counter! It's time for a beer.This happened last night",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
" On one quiet evening, while at the front desk,  
I saw a static black object on our security Cameras monitor in the loading area,  
for some reason, I went immediately outside to check.  
And here it was...a black briefcase....It was very heavy for it's size,  
lots of papers and a macbook can be seen from the edges.

I took it right in the office, and put a note  
to review the camera later, if no one claims it.

Couple of hours later, I admittedly forgot at that point,  
a middle aged man comes in the lobby \[an interior hotel\] and just sits by the window  
not a single word, just zoning out

  
After a little while, as he's passing me by leaving he utters  
"" *I messed up*"", ""*I messed up big time*""

  
I asked him why?  
he said he was suppose to deliver his boss's briefcase, and in it are important  
original copy papers, payrolls and the boss laptop along with about 8k in cash.  
he was one of the company's drivers

  
"" *I must've dropped it when I was unloading, and someone took it, we will never find out..*  
*there's just so many people in and out of here..I have to make the call, but I don't know what to say*..""

I told him to hold on for a sec, and came back holding the briefcase..the man's face..was speechless  
overfilled with joy, smiling to almost tears, thanking me over and over,  
he even reached out to try and hug me from behind the desk..

As I was concluding my shift ready to leave,  
the man came in, reached out and put in my hand $200, he told me to buy myself something nice,  
he was still in tears..I don't know what consequences he would've had to face if it was indeed lost..  
but I still remember his sincerity in thanking me till today.A Happy Tale from the Front Desk, for anyone feeling under",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I frequently describe my shift as 90% dull boring routine, 9% annoying problems, and 1% Pure. Raw. Terror.

Ahh, but that's *my* shift.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of what happens when that one percent lands on *someone else's* shift. Don't get your hopes up, I still had to deal with it.

So... I've not been sleeping well the past week. I have *finally* managed to get some decent sleep. I am *out*. Very very *very* asleep.

Too asleep.

Nothing quite like blearily looking at one's phone and realizing that you have slept through two alarms and your shift starts in five minutes. Bad words are said, but I'm out the door in record time

There will be no tacos tonight.

I am about halfway to work (and realizing I'm wearing yesterday's shirt, ugh) when I am passed by a firetruck. I will admit the rather selfish thought that at least I'm not whoever needed them.

You can see where this is going.

I come in and sure enough, that truck is parked in our hotel portico. Yay.

I am *way* too tired for Action Hero Skwrl. I'm still waking up so Lucky I've Got Pants On Skwrl is gonna have to deal with it. There is a trio of firefighters and an assortment of large metal implements.

Ah. It's the elevator.

We *just* had the damn thing serviced and inspected last week. And of course the fire department wouldn't be out here unless there was someone in there. So yeah, at least I'm not the one they're here for, but it's still something I need to deal with.

The gal on shift, 'Lisa', normally only works weekends. I've seen her maybe twice before now. Fortunately, she seems to be doing okay with the situation. Good. I have had coworkers who fall apart if we run out of staples, so a cool head is a fine thing.

All in all, everything is being handled. The firefighters are Trying Various Things to get the door to open. Turning the power off and on, trying to find the release lever with a slimjim, that sort of thing. The emergency elevator service has been called (you have *any* idea how much those guys charge? *YIKES*).

So not a whole lot after that. Sit around, talk with the firefighters, hand them my phone to speak with the manager, etc. There is some continued frobnication of the various components, but we're mostly waiting for the tech to arrive.

I've assembled something resembling a decent meal by raiding the breakfast supplies when there is a THUNK-clack! and the door opens. This surprised the firemen, as they actually hadn't been doing anything at the time.

I am of course ready to apologize profusely, but the former occupant just wants sleep, and heads to the door. Here's hoping she doesn't go full Karenasaurus tomorrow.

So how's your night going?

"So I work night audit at a Lariot extended stay hotel.

A couple months ago we had a guest that had been staying with us for a couple weeks. His card had been declining for a couple days, and he was over his limit. We couldn't get in touch with him, either. So the manager had security go enter his room to see if he was there. Security knocks on the door, and states his presence. No answer, so he goes in. The room is a total mess. Mud everywhere, dog smell, and an empty box aquarium sitting on the living room floor. No sign of the guest. Security comes back and reports what he saw, and that no one was in the room. So we lock the guest out until he returns. The rest is irrelevant to the story.

And then yesterday, maintenance goes to check on the pool, which is closed and tarped. We're switching pool care providers, so he had to do... something to the pool? Idk, I just work here. Anyway, they find about 20 goldfish just swimming around in there.

Now, I can't prove anything, but if I had to wager, I'd say that this guy had dumped out his aquarium *into the pool*. I didn't make the connection until I was talking with security earlier about it.

Some people are wild, man.

Edit: Our GM took one home with him to keep as a pet xD he named it Chip.

"I know we are all indoctrinated and pressed into fear and submission of corporate but I had it up to here with them and their greed and this oversell feature. 

We have had some guests tonight who had to be walked to another hotel and they were understandably furious. Every hotel in a 20 mile radius is sold out and it is unacceptable that their reservation is not honored. Especially if they made it well in advance. 

The guests were naturally inquisitive as to why this is the case. I tried my best to use the corporate lingo and runaround fluff speech but I had enough with the deception toward these tired, lied to and deceived guests. I pretty much told them corporate oversells the hotel to avoid lost revenue from no shows and that shiny stone members get preference as well as those with 2 or more nights. I told them it is horrible policy and deceitful and needs to end and I would be just as mad as them. My last guest was a shiny stone and I could not give up that room. I told them this as well because I had to! It’s part of the policy and they asked me straight up. Of course I offered them every recompense in the book and I was thankfully able to find a room elsewhere and they were nice about it and understanding of the predicament corporate places me in. As a night auditor, I don’t understand why I’m placed in these managerial situations and decisions but not getting manager pay. I made the decision to tell them the full and unequivocal truth and I stick by it. 

Am I in the wrong for spilling the beans and should I be fearful of corporate getting mad at me for telling the truth? I tell them to shove it. They make 2 million dollars a month which I’m sure equals to 1 million a month in profits and this nickel and diming is sick and preys on the ‘little’ people.

"Hiya.

I've had the following conversation three times now, and person I commented on with this convo told me to post it.

Quite often I get walk-in guests who book online travel agents right in front of my face, or out in the parking lot, or sometimes even on the way to the hotel AFTER calling me and asking about price and availability.

The hilarious irony is that we offer price matching.  If they just waited till' they got to the desk and showed me their phone, I would match any price they show me for a room in my hotel.

But, anyway.  This has happened three times now, almost word for word.  They come into the lobby, demand their room 'Right now!!'.  The following conversation then usually ensues:

-----+-+-------

""I'm sorry, sir, I don't have a reservation for you.""

'But I just booked it and paid for it.'

""Unfortunately, that reservation has not entered our system yet.  Therefore, again, I do not have a reservation for--""

'BUT I JUST BOOKED IT AND--'

""And, again, sir, I cannot give you a room without a reservation that is active in my system.""

'BUT--'

""SIR.  You are welcome to enjoy our restaurant while you wait.  However, there is no reservation for you at the moment.  Regrettably, our lobby and our pool are for guests only.  Now.  Is there anything else I can help you wi--""

'YOU CAN GIVE ME MY DAMNED ROOM'

""Sir, at this point I am going to have to ask you not to speak to me that way.  Now.  Would you like to book a room with me, or would you like to vacate my lobby until your booking comes through?""

'I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER.'

""My manager will be more than happy to speak to you when they return in the morning.""

'THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE--'

""Sir, I have already asked you not to speak to me in that manner.  You are aware of your options.  Do I need to call security today?""

-----+-+-------

Two of the three guests have then, steam blowing out their ears, proceeded to the restaurant. One of the times this happened past 11 PM.  Our restaurant closes at 11PM.

He then screamed at me,

""SO I GUESS I HAVE TO WAIT IN MY FUCKING CAR FOR LIKE AN HOUR?!""

To which I got to reply,

""Actually, sir, it is our hotel policy that there are no unregistered guests on our property after 11PM.  May I recommend the Denny's 3 blocks south?  They have excellent service, and are open all night.""Apparently I HAVE to post this. =P",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Every now and then, when there's a bit of a slow down

spend 30 min telling me how we are a scam, and it didn't say any tax online,  
and we stole her money...she's gonna""call the corporate"" and have us all fired

"First time poster, long time lurker.  Obligatory warning.  This just happened yesterday, and made me chuckle.  Cast is Me &amp; Gramps.

Gramps was walking from the elevators past the desk with his grandkids and one of their parents, holding one who was having a complete meltdown.  He asks us:

""Which way to the pool?""

To which I respond, across the Lobby, to the left, just past the &lt;name of bar&gt; Bar.

"I thought it'd be fun to share. Might not be a fun ~~story~~ rant. If anything you might be as frustrated as I was. 

*Technically* I'm front desk since I am part of the front line. My official title is a glorified service rep with a lot of designations. Sort of like ""operations expert"" which really means that you do a lot of stuff outside of your job description without being paid for it. 

Quibbling aside, I'm at my station. The first person that customers see when they come in is often me and they tend to make a beeline towards me. Even if my coworkers greet them or even declaring that they could assist them.

A customer walks in. Asian. Mid 40s. She's been here twice this week alone. As I am the only available representative, she comes to me. I recognize her. 
*(internal moaning)* 
You see, she's been having problems with her online account for this business. *But what does that have to do with you?* Excellent question but corporate has decided that front line staff should be able to resolve online issues despite us having an online related department. (Coincidentally that department is also another department. Isn't this company efficient?)

So here's the rundown of the issue. Standard stuff. Customer is unable to access her account when at home but is able to within the confines of this business when we had personally reset her password on two occasions this week alone. She refuses to call our online support number. 
C: ""but it just *stops* working when I get home. Here let me show you!""
*the customer attempts to enter her password on her phone. It says incorrect*

Me: ""okay, I'll go ahead and reset your password""
So I reset her password and I watch her put in her new password. And I tell her
""do you want a memo? Maybe if you write it down..?""
C:""no its okay. *it's a very easy password.* ""
*(internal yelling)* 
You don't say. So before she leaves I make her log back in in front of me. Surprise, she can't log back in. 
""it must be your system"" she had the audacity to say. 

We repeated this step again. She couldn't remember what ""new"" password she had made. 
 I wonder if there's a problem with her account. A lock that's there that I don't have authorization to see. So I reset the password again. I log in on my work computer just in case.
It works. She's just something else.

So I made her a password with her. A password we both know. It had 6 characters, 4 of which were sequential numbers (5678). You would think this is where this adventure ends however she exceeded my expectations and was unable to log in. So this is what it's like to be a disappointed father. Her excuses and blaming our system certainly didn't help. 

Maybe I messed up. So I try the log in myself on my work computer. It works. *maybe it's her phone! I hoped.*

I logged in just fine. There isn't a priest in the vicinity to check if her fingers are cursed. 

In the kindest customer service voice I tell her that there is nothing wrong with our system (nor I) and point out the things that are working in hopes that by the process of elimination she figures that maybe it's her. Maybe that's too much expectation for someone that **owns a company.**

She eventually left. It was anticlimactic and I took a sip of my coffee and greeted my next customer.It's your fault that I can't get into my account.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

There are normally two people who manage the front desk, but one could not make it. So I stepped in to help. The person I was working for speaks Spanish, the other person at the counter does not. Neither do I. What we both forgot was that the spot I was covering had a little sign that says ""hablo espanol."" Well in comes a gentleman who looks very... well, not to be stereotyping he just didnt look like a Hispanic gentleman. More caucasian in my opinion. 

He looks at the two of us. I am Filipino, but I admittedly look very Hispanic and get mistaken as such very often. My partner at the counter is very very white. He comes up to me and starts speaking Spanish. I was instantly confused and thought ""okay this guy just thinks I'm Hispanic. Innocent mistake."" 

M = Me, P= my partner/ other desk person, G= this Spanish-speaking gentleman. 

Me: Uh.... sorry, no habla espanol.

G gives me a funny look. P gets a panicked look and tells me I need to take down the sign that says I speak Spanish. P says sorry to G.

G continues to say something in elegant, fluent spanish. 

P holds up a finger and tries to ask him to wait a minute. She then, in front of G, calls for a coworker who also speaks Spanish.

G watches her do all of this, then as soon as she hangs up says ""oh I speak English"" and then proceeds to explain why he was there in elegant, fluent English.

It then quickly becomes apparent that G is at the wrong location and he goes on his merry way.

"First off, I want to be clear that I am not shaming this woman. I spoke with her several times and genuinely liked her. I think we would probably be friends.

Our Night Auditor sets up and cooks breakfast at our hotel, and covers until about 6:30am when the morning person gets there.

This young woman, looked very healthy, wearing a crop top and pj bottoms (with ripped abs showing), came down for breakfast. In no particular order, she ate:

An apple.

An entire bag of pancake mix, which makes about 20. (obviously they were cooked when she ate them)

6 pieces of buttered toast.

A bagel.

A plate of scrambled eggs.

10 pieces of turkey sausage.

8 Egg white omelets.

Bowl of cereal.

Bowl of oatmeal.

2 cinnamon rolls.

Drank 4 cartons of milk.

I'm thinking she was carb loading for a workout or something? She's possibly a marathon runner?

She stayed in the breakfast room, I watched her eat, she didn't throw any of it away, she literally just sat and ate and ate and ate. Then, I guess while digesting, sat and watched tv for a while. She didn't go to the bathroom afterwards, a couple people thought she might be bulimic and was going to purge. (I know this isn't a direct sign either for or against bulimia, just trying to give as much info as possible) When she left, she smiled and thanked me, and went to wake her family up. They were down shortly after and checked out.

I am just really impressed, that's all. I can't finish 2 pancakes in one sitting! I did have to go and cook more food, which was a little meh, normally I don't need to after the initial cooking.

"Mini Rant incoming.   
Me = Me  
D = Dickhead

So this is just about 10 mins ago. I'm checking in a pyrite member who wants to be on the first floor, which we unfortunately have booked up already, since it has the lowest room count of any floor since the lobby takes up a good chunk of my property.   


Me: And did you have any floor preference sir?  
D: Do you have anything on the first floor?  
Me: Unfortunately all of our king beds are checked in, I can see if I have a different room type.   
D: Can you? I don't really care what room type it is I just hate going up.   
(Checks)  
Me: I'm sorry it does look like everything is currently occupied or dirty.   
D: Really....the ENTIRE first floor is booked.   
Me: Yes sir, did you have any other preference?  
D: Well, if not the first then the highest you got, if I'm stuck in the elevator I at least should have a view. 

So I check, and the only room we have open on the 4th floor is one of our King Accessible rooms, literally the exact same, except the shower is a roll-in and the walkways are about 4 inches bigged to accommodate a wheelchair. So, since he just said he didn't care what room type, I follow his request and put him on the highest floor. 

2 minutes later and he's back by the front desk.   
D: You know nobody wants a fucking handicap room right? Why would you put me there?  
Me: Most people don't have any issue with those rooms but I'm sorry about that sir, you said you wanted something high and didn't care about the room type, so I followed your request.  
D: Well move me, I ain't no fuckin &gt;!cripple!&lt;  
Me: Sir the rooms are the exact same, the only difference is there is a bit more room and the shower doesn't have a ledge by the door. But I can move you. All I have left is the second floor, is that alright with you.   
D: You've never had ANYONE tell you that they don't want a handicap room?  
Me: Not after saying they don't care about the room types no. Like I said the rooms are practically the same as any other room.   
D: Oh bullshit. I'm sure the ADA would love to hear that they are exactly the same.   
Me: Here are your keys sir, have a good night.   


In truth, I have only ever had 3 guests in my 2+ years of Hospitality ever complain about being in an accessible room, but the ones that do complain HARD. I don't get it. No one is calling you handicap, it's a room, that the law literally dicates must be the same or better quality as ANY OTHER ROOM in the hotel. All you are doing is sleeping, grow up.

I wanted to reply when he asked me if anyone had told me they didn't want a handicap room ""Only the insecure ones"", but I like my job unfortunately.The only difference is the shower, grow up.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello all! I’ve got lots of stories from my 5+ years in hotels, but I’ll start with a little one that just happened today. 

I work for one of the big chains in a nicer property that has a lounge for the “shiny members” (I saw that in a different post and I like it so I’m going to steal it now.) 

So 3 guests come in and check in, they all add their reward numbers to the reservations, and the third guest asks “Do I get access to the lounge?” and I very politely told him that no, unfortunately he was one shiny level away from having access to the lounge. But we could add it to his reservation for about $20 if he would like. And his friends were the same level he was, so that wasn’t helpful to him either.

He looks at me blankly, then says. “So you don’t want us to stay here anymore, then?” 

I was a little confused, and just smiled and said, “Well, no. Actually if you stay /more,/ then you’ll have access to the lounge.” I apologized again (because that’s my habit) and asked again if he would like to add the lounge for $20, to confirm he didn’t want to. 

He flatly said, “No, we’ll just stay at [RIVAL HOTEL CHAIN REDACTED] from now on.”

I just smiled and continued making his keys without lounge access and said “Alright, if they’ll let you into their lounge then that’s fine.”

“Oh they will.”

Alright dude, I hope you find peace. And maybe an extra $20 to spare.Maybe if I threaten to stay at [RIVAL HOTEL] I’ll get my way!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

So this time around, it was a Chinese person, showing me a Chinese OTA. The thing about Chinese websites, as you may know, is the firewall limits contact with the outside world. Their bookings are never instant and it has been the case that we are completely sold out and they still say we have rooms available.

So I said to the customer: I can give you the same price as the agent, and give you your room immediately. If you choose to book via the agent, you are absolutely allowed to do that but I can guarantee you it will take AT LEAST ONE HOUR to get your reservation. 

They sucked it up and booked with us.

But what was so annoying was how stubborn the customer was.

Is that building still available?

FDA: Lemme check, no.

Customer: Is that building (points to same building) still available? 

FDA: I just told you sir, they’re fully booked.

Customer: Repeats question

FDA: Are you expecting me to change my answer?

Customer: Repeats question

FDA: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HOW MANY TIMES DID I TELL YOU THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS SOLD OUT FOR THE NIGHT I TOLD YIU ABOUT THE OPTIONS WE HAVE FOR YOU. DO YOU WANT THESE ROOMS OR NOT!

Customer: dumbfounded

In the end he ended up staying with us. But I’m just so confused on how he thought the answer would change...UPDATE: I had another one of these OTA nutjobs in front of me!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My boyfriend and I both work the front desk at two different hotels. We took a mini vacation to Orlando for the weekend to visit a theme park and stayed at a beautiful resort he got a great employee rate at. 

One night we’re dining by the pool and there are a few kids swimming and playing in the area. Then from around the corner we see a few ducks waddle our way, likely trying to grab a bite of our meal. Our waiter groans as this is a likely scenario for him while I resist the urge to feed the little dudes. 

All of the sudden I hear the unmistakable shrieking of wild eleven-year-olds. “DUCKS! DUCKS! DUCKS!” they screech while chasing after the poor things. The ducks, being completely startled, jump into the pool to escape. The kids jump in after them and for the next few minutes I watch in disgust as these kids go from one end of the pool to the other chasing after, splashing, and tormenting the poor things. 

I thought surely a parent would say something, but nope! Maybe the staff? Too busy with other guests. When I heard one of the hell-spawn scream “BLOCK THEM! THEY’RE TRYING TO JUMP OUT OF THE POOL!” I’d had enough. 

I got up and walked to the edge of the pool and shouted. “GIRLS, GIRLS! Stop torturing those animals! They are clearly trying to get away from you!”

They kind of blankly stared at me (probably embarrassed) and immediately let the ducks escape into the bushes. I went back to my meal and they continued to hang out for a few minutes before moving on in the direction of another pool. Hopefully they didn’t encounter any other small animals along their way!Can’t stop working, even on vacation.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A guy walks in inquiring if we have a lounge for shiny members.  We don’t have a lounge  as we are a select service brand so we tell the guest that we don’t have lounges at our brand.  

He proceeds to ask us to call the hotels in our area that may have it and ask them if he and his peers can be let in to their lounge so they can use the space until their next meeting.  We attempt to call the hotels nearby and no one is having it.  

How lounges work is that you have to be a guest at the hotel with lounges and is only accessible to elite shiny members.  

This guy isn’t staying at our hotel and we don’t know if he is staying at any hotel in the area.  

He continues to ask us to call the Milton brands because he is also an elite shiny member with those brands.  We attempt and all the responses we got were that he has to be a guest at that particular hotel. 

He starts going off how as an elite shiny member he should be able to access the lounges even though he isn’t staying at these hotels or ours.  He states he is going to contact corporate about this.  

We are all looking at him confused at how he is acting butt hurt he can’t get something for free.  

I don’t understand the entitlement of some guest that mostly travel for work.  Most guests aren’t spending a penny of their own money at the hotels, most if not all the money they spend is expensed back to their company.  Why feel like you are owed the hotel employees unborn child  because you spend your company money at our brands.I’m a shiny member in between meetings in the area, let me use your lounge",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I had just finished checking a guest in. When he walked out the lobby, I looked down at my hand and noticed my pointer finger was bleeding. I must've torn some skin right around my nail on something and not even noticed. There was blood on my keyboard and a little on my shirt.

I immediately went in to panic mode, hoping I hadn't accident gotten any on the key packet or the, god forid, the guest himself. Almost right after I realized what had happened, the guest game back in to the lobby, noticeably angry. I prepare myself for what's about to come. The first thing he said was ""Are you FUCKING kidding me? I can not believe you just bled on me"".

It had gotten on the key packet and a little on the palm of his hand. I actually had no idea what to say. I tried to explain but he kept cutting me off, going on about how disgusting that is and demanding to see a manager (of course, it was late at night when no management was here). He was livid. Constantly yelling at me while other guests are here trying to check in or passing through the lobby. Honestly one of the most embarrassing experiences of my life. 

When he finally let me talk, I gave up trying to explain and told him I'd comp the room for the night. That was enough because he was a super shiny elite member. I tell him he can speak to the GM tomorrow but all I can offer tonight is to comp the room. He finally just storms off with my GM's business card in hand.

I wasn't there the next day (thankfully) but apparently, the guy came down to make a scene again with my GM. He ended up getting like  50,000 points, free breakfast, a free 2 night voucher to stay at our hotel again (which he insisted he would never use because he'll never return to our hotel)

When I talked to my GM about it, he was SUPER understanding. He understands things like this happen and life just happened to bite me in the ass that day. Regardless, it was all a mortifying experience. 

(I should say that I understand fully why the guest was angry. That's pretty gross TBH. I just wish he could have been a little more understanding about my side as well. Shit happens and in this case, was unavoidable)That time I bled on a guest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Honestly this has to be one of the more silly ""I need a cheap room so give me a discount"" attempts Ive had in a while.   


The sports team from this weekend have gone home and our wonderful (quiet) business clients are steadily trickling in for their stays this week. (Yay!)  


In walks a walk in as I come back from filling up my yeti cup and asks if we have rooms available. I do for one night and I tell him the rate (119+ tax. Not bad for a steady week of check-ins) He then feeds me a story of how we always ask him to stay with us by giving him cheap rates (wha?).   


I put on my CS smile and simply state that I would need to verify that with my manager before I could give him such a discount. I could give him the mild shiny discount but anything less then that I would need to check first. He asks if anyone else is here and I state Im the MoD; sorry sir but that's an expired ""Get out of jail free"" card.

"Seriously, this blows my mind still. I’ve recently quit my FD job at a hotel I LOVED, and a slight part of me is wondering if I’ve made the right decision. 

Some backstory: my hotel is under new management. I got thrown into an FDM position in December, and the bar manager is supposedly the new AGM even tho it was never officially announced by the new GM. 

I’ve never cared for the new AGM since day 1. She trained me when I initially got hired at the bar, and some of the first words out of her mouth were how she’s the best bartender in town and that she purposely makes drinks stronger because it gets her more tips. To me, that’s theft. But it was never my place to say anything about it. 

When the new management took over, my feelings about her had gotten back to her, which is a whole other stupid ass story. I sat down with her and apologized to her, but I also told her I felt like she didn’t like me either and that’s why I may have been awkward around her. But this bitch, instead of maybe saying “I’m sorry you felt that way” or whatever, instead said “well I’ve been searching for your apology. I’m a very professional and approachable person...” UMM LOL OKAY? She’s not really approachable by the way, she talks like she’s permafried and has a resting bitch face like the world is sour. But I did what I had to do because I was really excited about the new management and the future of the hotel. I wanted to move forward

Cut to Valentine’s Day weekend. My husband and I had a plan for a couple of months to go out of town and visit his sister and her boyfriend. I requested the time off at the beginning of January, well before new management was a whisper in anyone’s ears. I wasn’t actually supposed to come home until Monday, but I told my husband we need to come home a day early so I could be at these important leadership meetings on Monday mornings. So we leave Sunday morning and I actually had to call the hotel because the schedule I made had gone missing, and I mentioned to FD1 that I was on my way home. 

230 rolls around, 30 minutes before the second shift comes in. FD2, ugh this guy. I feel for him. But he hasn’t been reliable since he’s started, and he got the job because he’s best friends with AGMs boyfriend. So anyways, his car breaks down on the way to work. He calls AGM and lets her know because he saw that I was out of town, otherwise he would’ve called me. AGM then texts me asking me to come in because my other 2 FD workers (FD3 and 4 if you will), FD3 had church and FD4 wasn’t available. 

I basically had to tell her twice that no, I was not coming in. I felt like a HUGE asshole for it. Really I fucking did. But I had also requested a day off at the beginning of the month that I couldn’t even take because of these new  leadership meetings. By the way the “meeting” that day consisted of me eating a hot dog, sitting there for about 10-15 minutes waiting, going around to the cold pool for a quick announcement, and watch the new GM jump in.. 

Monday morning, I run to my hotel to clock in before going to the meeting, and FD1 tells me that FD4 (the one who simply couldn’t come in) actually did come in around 430. I go to the meetings, see AGM, and tried to apologize to her and told her I felt like a dick. This bitch wasn’t having any of it. 

This whole situation lead to an argument between me and AGM: that as FDM, I should’ve handled it or had been willing to come in. WHICH I WOULD’VE! But the call didn’t come to me.

What also blows my mind is that there WAS coverage. I’m sorry, but Jesus will forgive you FD3 for missing one night of church, and FD4 was supposedly also a couple of hours away. I say supposedly because FD4 already has strongly expressed to me how uncomfortable she is working Sunday nights because it’s so dead. SO WHY would you ask someone who requested the time off, who’s ALSO a couple of hours away, to come in instead? 

The way I see it, is that it’s completely irrelevant what I was spending my time off doing, or where I may have been going to or coming from. If someone tells me they’ve requested some time off, as long as there’s coverage, they’ll have it. It’s none of my business what you’re doing on your time off, you could simply need a day for your mental health. I don’t care. You get that whole day and you won’t hear anything from me unless the hotel is burning down. 

AGM even tried to say “well I’ve had to do things for work when I’ve requested time off” which is just crazy! No one should have to do that. And even if work has to follow you home, you have the right to turn your shit off for a few hours and take a break. 

I didn’t quit because of this one situation, but this was strike 3 for me with AGM and I just can’t work with her. Am I overreacting?? I just felt like my requested time off wasn’t respected by anyone, and I would NEVER ask someone to come in if they’ve requested the time off. 

My former coworkers might read this but I don’t give a fuuuuuuuuuuck.Would you ask a worker to come in when they’ve requested the day off?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I work the 3-11pm shift at my hotel, and the primary night auditor is NOTORIOUS for staying 30+ mins after her shift on the clock to either ""finish things up"", or ""I needed to pass things on"" and my GM does not want ANYONE to go into overtime unless she says so.

So my managers solution. Extend my shift to 3-11:30PM every night so now the night auditor works 11:30-7AM to cut her hours back 2.5 hours to leave room for her lingering on the clock. At first I was like okay that's dumb but at least now I am getting 2.5 hours overtime instead of her. (doesn't really solve the problem but I wasn't going to complain about extra money on my paycheck). Well now THIS week my manager cut me a shift. I only work 4 days instead of 5.

I'm just so confused why we have to make up this stupid schedule just so ONE person doesn't go into overtime. Like right her up, threaten to cut HER 1 shift since she cant help but go into overtime. There is no other employee that stays on the clock THAT LONG and THAT CONSISTENT.We ""created"" a new shift so ONE employee doesn't go into overtime.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"One of the things I absolutely DREADED about working weekends, especially evening/overnight shifts, was knowing I was going to have to deal with bratty kids disturbing the other guests and really just being obnoxious because their parents rather just get shit faced than spend time with them. And it's not like it's the kids fault they're being shit heads, I would act out too if I thought my parents hated me enough to 1) pick up a fifth and a case of beer first thing after the game/competition/whatever the fuck 2) get so fucked up they have to be carted back to their room 3) let me roam the halls/parking lot in an unfamiliar town without knowing who else could possibly be staying in or stalking the hotel (which, NEWS FLASH, sex trafficking is kind of a major issue, especially at a hotel off one of the main routes). 

I was so sick of seeing these irresponsible parents get messed up, and then when I have to call them to get their kid from doing something bad or keeping their 2 YEAR OLD from wandering off into the parking lot because they left their doors open to go in between rooms (and not ONE parent noticed the baby was missing), I'M THE BAD GUY FOR ""NOT WATCHING THE CAMERAS"". It's not like my job requires me to, you know, DO MY JOB and check people in, get linens, do paperwork, general maintenance when something breaks, etc. No no no, my job is apparently to just sit at the front desk and baby sit everyone's kids for free.

"Hi all! FD supervisor here at a fairly upscale hotel and conference center. 
 
My FD agent and I had a new experience tonight, two guests walked to check in, my agent went through the whole spiel and when he asked for her ID she froze and said she didn’t have one, her license still had her maiden name on it and anyway it was back home. 

He asks if she has any kind of ID and she proceeds to show him a picture of her birth certificate on her phone! (Of course, the birth certificate still has her maiden name on it). He lets her know that unfortunately that is not a valid form of identification and she tells him that it’s state issued, to which he responds that it’s still not a photo ID and he can’t accept a picture of an ID. 

She then huffs and proceeds to dig her drivers license (the one she said was at home) out of her purse and tossed it at him.

story 1. one night. around midnight. it was slow and I had left the front door unlocked because our was sitting in his car just outside the door. (an actual sheriff officer in his police uniform and police car. Well a guy rushed into the office. bent over and acted like he was out of breath and his legs were hurting. I claimed that he just ran from the hotel next door. Now to get from there to here. you have to run around a fence and down a small hill. less then 5 mins if you ran. Well he claimed that he was trying to be a nice person. he picked up this young lady at a gas station who needed a ride to her room. Well when they got there. he got out and was walking with her to her room. When a guy came out with a gun. robbing him. He also claimed that they shot at him a few times, but I nor the officer herd any shots. The office had came into the office by thin and herd all of this. he looked at me and we both looked at each other thinking ya. we know what you were really doing. after a few min. he claimed that one of the 2 cars that were driving away was his. he left the keys and his wallet in the car. the office took off after the one we thought he had pointed to, but lost it. when he came back. the guy said no it was the other car. Well during this time the office was gone. he had left our hotel and walked back to the other one, but came back before the officer did. Well more officers arrived and they had talked to a woman he claimed was her who was walking away from that hotel. nothing happen. After the officers left. I let him is the hotel phone to call his wife. Waking her up and trying to tell her to just come get im with out telling her to much about what was really going on. He looked like he was not looking forward to that talk with his wife. lol

story 2. (shorter then the first) had a guy check in. told him he room was going to be on the back side of the hotel (exterior hotel) well after about 5 min. I get a call from him saying that the key was not working for the room, and the person for the room next to his was also having trouble.. Well I told him I would be right there. made a new set and walked thru the laundry room to the back. When I got there. there was no one there and the other room was occupied and the curtain was closed showing the people were in the room. I when back in and after another 5 min. he called back. I told him I went to the room and no one was there. He said he was in front of the room next to the snack machine. That is the thing. we do not have a snack machine on the property. Then I realized that he left the property and when up to the other hotel. lol he was lucky. with the type of people they let stay there. it is not the type of hotel you want to knock on the wrong room.

"Okay so I guess this isn't really a big long tale its just mostly a common annoyance I deal with every day. So we just opened up our restaurant and bar last month on the 30th (YAY!). Everything's great the only downside is since we have no room down here to build/add restrooms. They are all on the second floor. I don't know whats so crazy about having bathrooms on a separate floor than the lobby. Ive seen hotels with all sorts of layouts.

Every day I get alot of:

""What? The Second floor really!?"" 

""Why did they build them on the second floor??"" 

""That's weird""

""I'll just hold it.""

I'm just confused cause its not like I am asking them to go down the street to use the nearest restroom, you LITERALLY just walk up a flight or just take an elevator.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged that every hotel has, or has had at some point, at least one Mr X. 
Mr X is *that* regular guest, whose dreaded call comes when you least expect it, at 4pm on a busy day, with a nonchalant “I’ll be here around 10 tonight”, which makes the entire team sigh in unison : “oh no, *not* Mr X!”

Our Mr X not only always reserved at the least minute and did not take no for an answer, but he also haggled prices like his life depended on it, demanded free upgrades to a specific type of room, and exhibited all around terrible behavior. He would regularly go out a couple of hours before CO time on the day of his departure and tell the FDA “he’d call us to let us know if he extended or not”, leaving his things in the room, and of course we were supposed to hold the room until his majesty deigned to call. I actually had his things removed once because he hadn’t called at 3pm, and when he came back in the evening he threw a hissy fit because “if he hadn’t called to let us know he was leaving, that obviously meant he was extending his stay”. 

He was unpleasant to the housekeeping and breakfast staff, was pretty dirty (wrappers on the floor of the room etc) and generally pretended to be a nice person until someone disagreed with him, or dared to be taking care of another guest while *he* had needs to be attended to (the indignity!), which is when he would flip his lid. You know the type. 

Mr X had managed to extract a comp stay from our management because of an extremely shady “lost piece of luggage” complaint (supposedly we’d lost it while we were keeping it for him, supposedly it was very expensive branded luggage, etc). He then proceeded to not show up for the comp stay, which meant we lost a room during high season, then called one week later to get his comp stay at a new date, saying the original date hadn’t been confirmed and it was our fault for misunderstanding him. Management gave him the second date comped as well.

Now, as you can imagine, I’d been dreaming about blacklisting Mr X for ages, but no dice. We’re a small property and management has a pretty loose policy on rates- as long as you’re inside budget, upgrades, comping breakfast, etc, which is good in some ways since our FDA have a lot of decision power (we have a very competent front desk team), but our worst regulars know this and will try to take advantage of it every time. Mr X was coming fairly regularly and giving management that sweet no commission piece of business; in addition of how difficult it can be to actually blacklist someone. 

Until The Joyous Day of Reckoning, that is. 

During his comp stay, Mr X was staying in the same room with his ex wife and their toddler, who they were having a custody battle about. We found this out because Mr X’s other, adult son came to FD in the evening to get a second room for the previous Mrs X “just in case they had a fight”, which should have alerted us. 

During the night, all hell breaks loose and they start fighting, screaming, throwing things at each other etc. The NA, who has plenty of experience and takes shit from exactly no one, calls the police, but they don’t end up doing much except giving them a warning since it’s a mutual domestic dispute and there is no actual injury. 

The next day is a Saturday, which means no management, which means I’m in charge (I’m FOM, but since it’s a small property and we’re always understaffed, I work a lot of FDA shifts). I call our GM who tells me I finally get the pleasure of throwing him out. Guy has done his usual shit, gone out the room and told us to hold it until he confirmed he would extend, so I call him on his mobile and tell him that we won’t charge him for tax or extras and he can take as much time as he needs, but all of his things need to be out of the property by the end of the day and he won’t be staying with us again. 

Ensues:
- screaming
- insults 
- threats 
- demands to speak to the GM (as well as strong implications that he wants to talk to a man, I’m a rude, insignificant small fry and can’t tell him what to do, etc)

I say nope to all the above as politely as I can manage. He ends up coming back, luckily considerably subdued, and exits with family and belongings in tow, fighting with his ex all the way to the door. 

The comical afterword of this story is that he keeps calling periodically over the following months asking for a room and gets told every time that we’re fully booked, until the GM finally gets him on the phone and tells him that the breakup is final and there’s nothing he can do to get us back.The ultimately satisfying tale of Regular Guest X",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Anyway, since I was annoyed at this and at the last meeting, I left my manager a long assed letter with things that I would love it if they addressed. I'm happy to say that she incorporated the entire thing into the meeting. 

I've been at this for far too many years, I've picked up some tips and tricks along the way, I had to interject with corrections on some of the other things that were being discussed and apparently stumped everyone with some of the things I taught them. (Not to toot my own horn because most desk clerks get shitty training, but everything I know how to do in this system I taught myself and I seem to know more than my higher ups.)

Then it happened. We finished up the meeting, I was showing everyone random things on the workstation and my manager pulled me aside and asked me to write the training manual.... I need to learn to shut the hell up sometimes. 

I've ended up writing the manuals for every property I've been at but no system has ever been the same so it's like starting from scratch every time.Open mouth, insert foot.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have been at the property I currently work at for about a year and half now and generally have not too many major issues. Yesterday unfortunately was not one of those days:   
   
 Group of parents from an in state college were here following their sons and daughters around to their meets. All they like to do is sit the lobby and get wasted. Under Virginia law any alcohol that is not purchased on site can’t be consumed in the lobby as it’s considered a public space.   
   
 “§ 4.1-308. Drinking alcoholic beverages, or offering to another, in public place; penalty; exceptions.

 If any person takes a drink of alcoholic beverages or offers a drink thereof to another, whether accepted or not, at or in any public place, he is guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. Public place means any place, building, or conveyance to which the public has, or is permitted to have, access, including restaurants, soda fountains, hotel dining areas, lobbies and corridors of hotels, and any park, place of public resort or amusement, highway, street, lane, or sidewalk adjoining any highway, street, or lane.""  
 

I inform the leader of the group that this can’t continue to happen and if it does you will be subject to eviction. I normally tend to give a few warnings but it still continues to happen you will be tossed.   
 

He says “Okay, we no better it won’t happen again and the drinks will be put up.” Not even 15 minutes later, guess who is behind a column grabbing beers from his backpack?  
 

Politely informed him since we have had this issue numerous times I have but no choice to ask you to leave. He then had some very nice words for me and then actually left with not too much more of a fight.   
 

This group has also been informed that they are no longer allowed back at the property per the GM and Sales Director.   
 

I am not risking my job, our liquor license or the huge fine that comes along with it. Not worth it at all.   
 

Anyone else have any issues regarding the same?

"A snowy morning in my small mountain town, and a quiet night audit for a weekend with several large tours in-house, but it's never that easy, is it?

Our pool is closed from 10 to 8 since there's only one person on  during graveyard, but last night our pm shift gave a guest the OK to one of our guests to use the pool room to exercise at 4am while her family was asleep.

Of course, when one person is in the pool room after hours that means other guests decide that they can use it at any hour too, and at 5 our towns resident sex worker wanders into the lobby, having clearly just come out of the hot tub, to grab some coffee. She was just wearing an oversized button up shirt, but it was long enough I didn't feel right saying anything. Until her guest came into the lobby a few minutes later wearing just his swim trunks, old man hairy chest bared to the fluorescent lighting of the lobby. 

He asks her for his shirt back

She undoes the button 

I prepare myself for her chest to be out

I prepare myself to ask her to put the shirt back on

I silently thank the gods she's wearing a bikini underneath 

Its never that easy

In the worst timing for a wardrobe malfunction, taking off the shirt causes the shoulder tie to come undone

A family walks into the lobby to check out, and her chest is bared to them.

Luckily the guy was at least semi classy and covered her back in the shirt, and the family was understanding, but holy shit.

"So I heard this guy came in to the hotel and only booked with us today, paid in full for a week+. 

This guy, like the title states, is at reception. Currently he’s listening to music and “singing” (more like talking the lyrics out loud). He has given me a 20 minute lecture about the recent incident in my town which involved an attack. To add to that note, the victims of the said incident were apparently on a 6 week coma which he also went through. He’s also pointed out to me that after I give birth, I’ll also be in a 6 week induced coma. 

After that he asked me about the names of my baby, noting that I should hurry and choose because it’s definitely a boy but if it’s a girl that’s okay too. - more to add later on his current tirade.

"Hockey team weekend. 92 check outs. More than usual but nothing we can't handle. 

We have a very small parking lot, and parking is not included in the price, so when people come in with two cars each, it fills up very quickly. Luckily we have a backup: we rent the parking lot next door from the office across the road, and it's not far from the hotel. There's us, a shoe store next door, then the lot. 

Mr. Asshole comes up to the desk and smacks the parking pass for the other lot on the desk. 

MA= Mr. Asshole   CW= Co-worker

MA: ""You're gonna comp the parking right? Because we had to park over there.""

CW: ""No sir, it's still our parking lot.""

"So here I am starting my shift. I'm printing reports and doing my thing and down comes a young couple. (not super young, but I'm getting old and they're younger than me.) 

Dude: Cool tatts man! Where'd ya get it? (I have a rather nice sleeve if I do say so myself and I wear a polo.)

Me: Thanks, I got it when I lived in Texas!

Dude: Oh, didn't get it around here?

Me: Yeah, no. Not around here, none of the shops around here are all that good.

Dude: Oh... Do you like music?

Me: I DO like music.

Dude: Cool.. I like music too.

They're either drunk or slightly stoned (legal here)

I don't normally post things outside of bitching, but it caught me off guard and it was slightly cute. We also have the drag queens in house and my rather steady chick that the casino pays for coming in tonight. It might be a tolerable evening..Sometimes I like the drunks",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Last night, we were sold out and had almost 150 check-ins which is INSANE for our sized property. It was the most I've ever seen in my 2 years working here.

Anyway, it had been ridiculously busy, non stop. I had a line of 5 people that I was trying to tear through as fast as possible. A woman who had been standing in line for like 5 minutes gets up to the counter, I ask her for her name, and nothing comes up. I tell her this and she just rolls her eyes. She says ""well check again because I know I have a room here.""

I tell her I need a confirmation number. After another round of eye rolling, she pulls out her phone to look for it. Thankfully, she was able to find the confirmation number right away (we all know how frustrating it is to wait around while a guest digs through their phone for 5 minutes looking for it). I put the number in and, of course, she's supposed to be at a different hotel a couple miles down the road, also the exact same brand as my property.

Obviously that wasnt going to be the end of our conversation. The first thing she said after that was ""then move my reservation here. I honestly cant believe you're being this difficult. If you had bothered to check, you'd know I'm an *elite member*"" I'm super annoyed at this point. I tell her we're sold out so I cant offer her a room here. She then says ""but I DO have a reservation, you just refuse to honor it"". She just couldn't understand that just because she had a reservation with a brand, that doesnt mean she can stay at literally any property under that brand using the same reservation number. And of course she mentions her *elite status* like that's supposed to make a room magically appear.

After she went off about that, I had no idea what to say. I finally just say ""ma'am, theres nothing I can do for you. I'm going to have to ask you to step aside so I can assist the guests who actually have reservations with us"". She gives me one of the bitchiest looks I've ever received and says ""wow. Well you have just been so much help"" (very condescendingly and sarcastically). She just storms out the door.Guest goes to the wrong hotel, gives me hell because I can't do anything to help her",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is mostly just a rant. On almost every one of my shifts this homeless man comes in to warm up. Normally I’d have empathy for him, maybe he just is in a rough place, but he’s always drunk and always making weird/sexual comments towards me. I am a pretty small young female so things like this do unsettle me a little. He came in today with some other people and wanted to get a room (this hasn’t happened before). This is a small business and I do have say in who I want to rent to, and if I get any uncertainty about renting to them I can tell them no. I told him no, I did not feel comfortable renting to him. I don’t know why this was surprising to him, but he got all upset. Tried getting my name. Said I was discriminating against homeless people. I mean I wouldn’t feel safe with him here. I love my job, but stuff like this just sucks.The regular homeless man",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So here in Florida we get a season of snowbirds and if you are one of the major cities (which I am in one) there is also Baseball Spring Training. So from about mid January to about Easter, give or take a week, our hotel and many around us Sell out and our price go from $250+. 

So of course we get calls and walk ins looking for rooms. Some days about noon we may still have rooms, but by 6pm or so we are sold. And that's when people get desperate, they either get attitudes or start pleading. I understand the frustration, but at the same time it baffles me how people travel. 

Most of the time these scenarios do not get to me, I just think tough luck bud, but not my problem. But the one that gets me every single time, ""Are you sure you don't have a spare room?"" Like dude my job is to sell out this hotel, I get bonuses when I sell out the hotel. Why in God's name would I keep a room vacant? Or have I forgotten about that one secret room that is sold to weary travelers at midnight, the one between 416 and 418 (we have evens on one side of the hall and odds on the other).

I don't know why but this one question just always gets under my skin and I have to take a breath before replying. Typically I just repeat what I said before they asked, but sometimes is just a hard No.

"So this story still makes me giggle even now. These guests check out with me in the morning and I’m so excited to hear about what other escapades they have had since they checked in Friday night, but this one has definitely stood out for me.

I’m on the night shift and it’s about 3am. I’m on the desk now after coming early to help in the restaurant, and I’m just processing paperwork. I hear the doors open and I just hear a loud voice exclaim ‘but with your sandwich!’ and instant intrigue hits. They come up to the desk and ask if the bar is closed - in our hotel, the night porter served after the bar staff leave at 10 so technically the bar never closes for residents. Grabbing the keys I direct them down to the bar and down we all go. 

Now for the fun part. 

We get into conversation as I’m pouring them pints of beer, and I soon find out the story of what happened with this sandwich.

These guys have been out in the city and of course when you drink you get hungry. They go to a kebab place and order food, ordering themselves an Uber at the same time. They get their food, the cab comes, and get ready to leave. It’s at this point that the driver tells them they’re not allowed to take food in his car. The one guy says ‘no problem’ and gets rid of his food, but the other guy sneaks it into the car and says nothing until they get back to the hotel. 

This is when he pulls the sandwich and the fries out of his jacket, waves it in the air and gives a loud cry along the lines of ‘hahaha I had food with me all this time!!’ and in the heat of the moment the sandwich and the fries are both launched at the ground by Mr Drunk in his attempt to stick it to the man. It made a huge mess, but it was hilarious all the same.

Turns out we were both big fans of School of Rock, and it was at this point I said to the guy he should have got his friend to record it, play it over the ‘well you’re not hardcore, unless you live hardcore’ and post it to YouTube. 

I think ‘Mr Schneebly’ would have been proud.Two guests stick it to the man with a chicken sandwich",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Cute older couple walk in the lobby, past me, to the elevator. About 20 minutes later, they come to the front desk. 

Cute elderly lady: EL Me: ME

EL: ""Excuse me but your elevator wont take us to our floor. Our room is on the 4th floor but it only goes to up to level 2.""

ME: ""Oh, I'm sorry but we only have two floors. May I get your name so I can check your room number?""

They hand me their key packet, same as our hotel, (but it is the same for entire brand I work for). Sure enough, their key packet says room 4-something. I again ask for their name, look in the system. Dont find them anywhere. 

ME: ""I dont see a reservation under your name. Is it possible you could be staying at X, Y, or Z properties?""

EL: ""No, we are staying here. We checked in right here. Same lobby, same bar, same fireplace. We were just in our room a few hours ago.""

I obviously know they aren't staying with us, we only have two floors. And I hear guests say all the time they have stayed at the same chain &amp; the lobbies all look the same. I asked them to take a seat while I figured it out for them. I called the other hotels in town, (we have three different chains of our hotel's brand that are on the same street plus another of our brand on the other side of town) and they, sure enough, had the wrong hotel. I explained, printed out directions to their correct hotel and let them know the front desk agent at Z property is waiting for them and will assist them when they arrive. 

I have had this happen more than once &amp; usually the guests are yelling at me, swearing that I am lying to them. (why would I purposely tell someone they aren't staying with us, when they in fact, are?!) Thankfully, this older couple just chuckled,  apologized and went on their way when I explained it all. The husband even fell back to say to me ""I knew it looked different but she was insistent!"" 

Also, we are a small property. Two floors, one elevator. One entrance. The fact it took them 20 minutes, apparently riding the elevator up &amp; down before they came to the front desk just melted my cold heart.

"A long time ago in a hotel far far away I angered the hospitality gods and they sought retribution in the form of the worlds greatest detective. From here on out known as Detective Idiot or DI for short. DI was like any other guest before the gods decided we should share a special moment in hospitality guest relations. I did not check him in and he was just a name and a room number until he needed something because of course he did. 

It started off simple enough, DI called down to report his lights above his bed didn't work. I had the misfortune of being maintenance whenever maintenance left for the day and so up I went. The lights above the bed have their own switch on the side of the unit for convenience sake and indeed this switch did nothing. After DI and myself both nodded in agreement this was the case I went to check the breaker to tick all boxes before asking if DI would like to move rooms. 

As the breaker box was all fully on and we didn't have replacement bulbs for those specific lights at the time DI did indeed want to move. I called down to my coworker and had them prepare the keys as DI prepared his things. I handed DI the keys and directed him to his new room down the hall, all was well. (It wasn't)

In the time it took me to ride the elevator back down and reassume my position at the desk, DI had already called down to report we were 0/2 on working bed lights. ""No fucking way."" I replied to my lovely coworker who was now laughing as I shook my head and turned around to head back up. Keep in mind, the entirety of both rooms were fully functional as intended, besides these tiny little reading lights attached to the bed. After i've entered the room DI has a newfound annoyance in his greeting. ""You know I just...I just dont get it, how do the rest of the lights work and these ones don't."" 

This time around I did what I should have done the first time, remembered I know this property better than the guest. After flipping on every light switch HUZZAH the bed lights come on. I chuckle quietly and explain to the guest the rooms have a master switch that allows you to turn specific lights off but others are turned on/off manually or are attached to the other switches. Surely DI would see it was just a funny little mishap and the lights now work, we could both go our seperate ways. I had just offended his entire bloodline and every moral he had ever held dear in his life by flipping that switch. 

Much like an encaged primeate who has just discovered a new toy fell upon their enclosure DI looked upon this supposed ""master switch"" with great intrigue. After flipping it on and off a few times to see what would happen he decided that he was not wrong but in fact whoever designed such a contraption and all the employees who were complicit in duping him from basking in the glorious warmth that is the headboard reading lights were wrong. 

You see, the master switch had to be flipped down to be on and up to be off. Whenever it was flipped up a small nightlight would come on to presumably be able to see it in the dark. DI had deduced that this makes no sense and the engineers who designed this were out to spite him however many years ago these switches had been installed. While he proceeded to give me a lecture on light switch design and I was inclined to agree this design was silly, I couldn't help but begin to scream in my head ""YES, BUT DO THE LIGHTS WORK OR NOT?"" During my inner monologue he says something that I don't know how to take. 

""You see, i'm not an idiot. The lightswitch is flipped upside down."" 

Its only in retrospect I realize he did not find any humor in the situation and probably did not appreciate my failed attempt to receive what I thought to be a joke. I hid my smirk quickly and proceeded to endulge him on the rest of his tirade. ""No sir, I do apologize if the switch was confusing and I do see your point. It is odd that it was designed that way."" Translation: Asshole, the lights work. I get it, you don't appreciate how easy of a fix it was. Enjoy your lights and let me leave. 

He then proceeded to inform me of his problems with the particular brand while allowing me to bask in the glory of his status. ""And can you put me down for no housekeeping. All housekeeping at [redacted]'s are scum."" I cant speak to all [redacted]'s but i'm once again inclined to agree with him to a degree. Housekeeping fucks everyone over at least once but its a shit job for shit pay, what'cha gonna do. Its at this point I finally calm DI down enough to make my escape and hurry to the front desk so I can politely inform my coworker that DI's issues have been adequately solved. (Read: Shit on him for wasting my time) 

If you think that's the end of this saga you haven't worked in hospitality long enough. This post has gotten seriously long and I just needed somewhere to vent for the day. If people are interested i'll post the remainder of the story another day.

Mind that your cut out time its 3am, you have to check in on the same day of your reservation, because our system doesn't reinstate reservations. And since we are busy, once your reservation is automatically canceled, your bed might get sold. 

And today we are sold out.

This lady comes, saying I paid for it, I can check in at whatever time or day of my stay I want.

It happens to me a lot, people just thinks the rooms are going to be waiting for them with an open door if they don't even message or call the place to say they are indeed showing up.

"So I was working in the restaurant tonight as a favour because the restaurant manager was near exhausted. Our kitchen is open for food between 6pm and 9pm on a Friday night, and we do our best to make sure all guests are aware of this to avoid any issues. 

It’s 9:30, I’m polishing glasses and tidying up ready to close and move upstairs when this group of three come in asking for food. I politely apologise and say our kitchen closed at 9, and then went on to suggest a couple of nearby restaurants that my still be serving food (to which they kept interrupting me) and local places that deliver to the hotel. I start to take their drinks order and one lady says to me ‘but we’re residents of the hotel, are you sure you’re not serving food?’, and I again politely explain no we’re not serving food at all after 9pm. Our chefs have both gone home at this point, and I’m not qualified to cook safely so I can’t even make for them a sandwich. 

It’s worth considering Fridays we have a local business group that come in to the restaurant and have an early breakfast meeting. Our breakfast chef came in at 5:30 to prepare for it, and he was doing a split tonight so he left at 12 and was back in for 6. So, as bad as I felt for Karen ‘being in a meeting’ and not being able to have the chance to eat, my sympathies lie more with the chef who has done split shifts for the past three days in a row.Karen is upset that our chefs have to go home at some point",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So this is a short one.

We had a guest walk in, and we actually had been talking to them. We suggested a deluxe room for them and they thought it was the cheapest room type. Nope. It’s absolutely not. 

As we were talking they wanted to book a superior room. I said “Sir we only have one room available” and they’re like “OTA says you’ve got plenty available!” 

Me: There’s no way OTA would be wrong.

Then he just books it, right in front of me, on his phone in the OTA. I tell him he’s going to have to wait for his booking to come through, maybe 10-15 minutes. Customer goes on rant about how he’s already paid and that sort of bullshit, and I just respond with “you could’ve... you know... just paid with your credit card in the front desk and I would’ve given your room right now. But you adamantly refused to.”

Turns out, the rate they paid on the OTA was MORE EXPENSIVE than our walk in rate. (Ours was 1993 per night local currency, they paid 2100 per night. Its not much, but it’s satisfying)

"Good evening, lovely denizens of the desk. Are you comfortable? Did you do all your check-ins? Good. Then let me tell you about a guest who got reverse Uno'd by the policy he was attempting to invoke from the dredges of the policy manual like some cult leader trying to raise some all-powerful undead god, only for it to backfire in his face.

Our story begins with of course, an entitled guest at a hotel too damn small for a person of this shiny, top-tier status. With big titles comes bigger entitlement! He's been here so long I've seen his hair measurably grow, for reference of how long this guy has been here. Now, being a top-tier with no end-date in sight for his check-out, he gets real comfortable. Does all the annoying, but relatively harmless stuff that Kyle/Karen guests do. Says he knows the policy, but then fights me on everything to house-keeping policy, points awarded to his account, the check-out time (our current story), everything.

The thing about this guy and how unpredictable he is comes from the fact that he checks out, and almost immediately checks back in. He says he's here for work but he's in the room all day. I suppose it's computer work, but still it looks like rewards farming to me. Oh well, not my worry.

Then, the day finally comes that this guy is going home. And look, not another duplicate reservation made at 11:30 in the morning? My lucky day. Of course, he calls to push his late check out past the actual time it's supposed to go. He tries to request an extra 30 minutes.

Sorry, no can do, I reply into my telephone with a forced smile. Max check out is 4 pm (4 hours after our standard check out, thank you), housekeepers gotta leave. This is a small hotel, we don't have 24/hr service.

""You know, you really don't know the policy,"" he informs me with an exasperated sigh. ""As a \[redacted\] level member, I can have \[redacted\] help-line call and give me my 24 hour stay. You can't force me out.""

I blink a little. 24 hours, huh? You wanna play hard ball with me over 30 minutes? Okay, smart ass. I'll show you the policy.

""Of course,"" I reply congenially. ""You're more than welcome to call the \[redacted\] line and request the same time to check-out as your check-in time, let me see your last check-in...Oh! I see you checked in two weeks ago at...9:30 a.m.""

Top-tier shiny member, we love you so damn much we let you check out and check right back into the same room every single time you wanna extend your stay. We're kind. We don't have to let you do these early check-ins, but you give us such headaches by trying to force late check outs that we just do it at breakfast for you so that you don't have attitude with us or the poor housekeepers. And now you've tried to one-up me without even checking your hand, you absolute buffoon.

""So unfortunately, from the time you checked into your room from your last stay has already passed,"" I say. ""I can offer the max 4 o'clock check out. After that, it'll be a day charge of half your daily rate. We do apolo--"" oh, he hung up.

"Apologies for format on mobile yadda yadda. Work overnight and oh boy was tonight just one those nights; the ones where you want to run away and hide in a cave from society. My fun moments:
1. Had a guy get pissy and scream he would RUIN me and yelled ""You bitch!""  As he walked out because I refused to rent him a room as I felt uncomfortable (should have said I was sold out, but I was half awake so big derp moment) This was after he had spent the last few minutes saying he would stay at another hotel and trying to get my last name. Gee, wonder why I felt uncomfortable?
2. A guest who came down to tell the tale of the noise which sounded like a hospital cart missing a wheel rolling on wood. Apparently heard last night at 2a and 4a. Still no answer to that one
3. Drunk guy who kept trying to hit on me and stated ""you're really good at diverting conversation.  I can see I'm making you uncomfortable but I'm going to keep talking to you to see how far I can go."" I wish that was hyperbole.
4. Guest who seemed to think we changed over our day at 8p like the banks and so, even though I had told him we were sold out (actually were at that point) he thought making the reservation would make the room fairy appear and he could check in. Dude, no. That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works.

"I work for a chain shmotel, unfortunately my grandmother passed away so I’ve travelled states to be at her funeral. I get a 40% off employee discount so I just went with the closest location to where I need to be for the funeral. It’s in a college town in southern/midwestern USA so it didn’t seem to be bad at all. 

And it’s been crap since the jump and I feel like I can’t complain or say anything since I’m an employee for the same brand but my god wtf. For one, the rooms are 45.99 plus tax a night here. And yet at check in the manager told me it’s 39.99 with my discount. I only needed to e most basic one bed room. We talked but yeah he’s like that’s the price....whatever I’m not trying to argue I’m only here for one night so oh well it’s still way cheaper than the prices are where I live. 

So I check in and they’ve put me in a room with all the extras like what the fuck they clearly asked and I clearly said no to those kinds of rooms. The place is run down the stairs are literally crumbling away , concrete just coming off in chunks and some steps have been replaced with just straight up wood boards. None of the lights in the room work, except the one overhead light so whatever , then none of the freakin plugs work except the one by the sink. The tv is saying there’s no signal to it, there’s no freaking hot water??? 

I called well in advance to reserve the room and asked for downstairs they said no problem at all, get here and nope none even though the hotel obviously isn’t even close to capacity. Whatever. So I’m sleeping and get woken up a 2 am to some random guy pounding on my door, I don’t freakin open up, I look out the peephole and then out the front window and see him going down the line banging on doors so I call the front desk and he’s like ‘oh so he’s knocking on someone else’s door now’ and I’m like well yeah...but he’s also yelling and gesturing and flailing and cussing at some people in cars downstairs? Idk what’s going on but it doesn’t seem good and literally the guys like, oh well I’m sure they’ll work it out ?!?!?!?!?. So I’m just kind of like.....ooooookay. 

I hang up and I’m like well I’m fucking awake now and my flights in the morning I guess I’ll go ahead and shower and there’s no hot water??!??? I ran it forever literally 30/40 minutes and I’m just sitting in there the whole time checking it with my hands and yep nada , zero hot water. So I call the desk again and I’m like I’m so sorry to complain yadda yadda but there’s no hot water and of course he’s like wel did you u let it run and I said yes I didn’t want to bother you so I ran it for 30/40 minutes checking the whole time just to be sure and there’s just none....I hear a teeth sucking sound and he’s like ‘oh....yeah’ followed by the longest fucking silence. So eventually I’m like ‘oooookay, well I’m not here long so I don’t want to bother you to move rooms, is it possible you have an empty room I could just use to shower’ response:‘ huh.....’ LONGEST SILENCE EVER. Hmm well yeah , I guess. Silence. I’m like okay so I’ll come to the desk then? Followed by ‘yeah I guess’ 

By the way it’s freaking freezing in this part of the country, I’m the furthest point away from the desk, it’s fucking 2:30 am. So I run up there, get the key from this guy who’s so freakin rude and just can’t be bothered to even exchange a word, run back, grab my shower crap, go 10 doors door, go in and NONE of the lights work in this room but there is hot water. So I shower and then run through the freezing cold with wet hair back to my room. There’s been people screaming and arguing in the parking lot, shady guy out there doing his thing, what I’m positive is a drug dealer driving in and out constantly, and just in general bad news going on and I’ve been so freakin paranoid about the rental car they gave me at the airport because it is a nicer car and every time I’ve come here the other guests have just been staring me down. They gave me a room facing a forest on the back of the building where there was nowhere to park the car nearby. Idk man there a bunch of other little small things about this place that are just falling apart and in disrepair but I honesty want to leave a review to warn other people but I feel so bad because I know how it is working for the same company but I mean come on it’s ridiculous and they way the staff have treated me from the jump, all I can think is how I and my co workers respond to similar things at our property, and it just blows my mind to be treated this way. Idk. I can’t wait to get out of here


Edit to add I forgot when I first checked in I went to wash my face and the drain like plug thing is missing from the sink and there was a wet cigarette butt shoved down there. And they only had one towel in the room. So that was nice too.I’m conflicted",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Exactly as you read. I was the manager on duty that day, i finished my morning shift probably 10-15 mins over my end time, handed over the days incidents and matters to the next manager on duty. 
It was a Sunday afternoon and each sunday the hotel hosts an afternoon tea for the grey set. This started after my finish time. 
All's well when i left. I come in the next day and i hear an older lady had a heart attack and died at the afternoon tea. My manager calls me into her office, i assume to ask if im ok etc., Nope fuck that. She actually says with all seriousness ""why did you leave so early yesterday, we could have used your help with the medical emergency, (other manager) struggled to cope"". I was SHOCKED. I bluntly said ""are you serious? How was i to know someone was planning on having a heart attack and dying an hour after my finish time?!"" She responded ""well if you could try and make a habbit of staying back a little incase we need help"". I noped out of that and walked out. Finished my shift exactly on time that day....Lady has heart attack, dies an hour or so after my shift ends in hotel cafe - manager: ""you should have stayed back incase things like this happen!""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have had multiple guests over the years I have worked in hotels ask for things.  So many homeless people or just those down on their luck looking for a free room or a free cab ride to the other side of town.  People ask for free phone chargers that other guests may have left behind, free laundry service, and other random commodities all for FREE!

Today a potential guest walks up to the desk.  He reeks like cigarettes and has a nasty sickly sounding cough.  Being pregnant and not wanting to catch his germs, I kinda scooted away to talk with him at a distance.

He wanted our cheapest room available.  I tell him that I will need to see a Credit Card and ID.

He has ID, but no CC, so I tell him that there is another hotel on the other side of town, who will accept cash as payment, but it's the only one in the whole city that will do it.  He wants me to make an exception, I tell him no.

Meanwhile he's open mouth coughing over the whole desk and reeking up the place while I have other people coming in to be checked in.  I tell him there's nothing I can do for him, and I have guests to help.

He starts pulling everything out of his pockets and putting in on the germ-ridden counter.  Maybe he has a secret credit card?  It's a bunch of paper and envelopes and cigarettes.

After I check in the other guest, this guy asks me for the phone number to the hotel I mentioned.  I write it down and give it to him.  He calls, tells him his name and phone number and walks off.

He comes back and asks if there is someone who can give him a ride.  I tell him that I can call him a cab, but it may be awhile because I just called a cab for an actual guest and they estimated a 40 minute wait. (We are in a relatively smaller city, no Uber or Lyft or anything like that)

He is irritated and asks how he is supposed to get over there? (How the fuck did you get here to begin with dude?)

I remind him that I can call a cab.  He asks if I'm gonna pay for it.  Uhhh no, it will be less than five bucks, if you can't afford that, you can't afford a hotel room that is gonna ask you to put down a deposit.

So in comes the guest that I called the cab for (which has also been an issue during his stay, but that's another story)

He asks this guy for a ride and he says that he doesn't have a car and is taking a cab.  The guy asks if he can take his cab.

I really don't know what was going on with this guy.  He seemed out of it, but not on drugs, just generally out of touch with how society functions.

"Yesterday this happened about 30 minutes into my night shift. The previous person had explained to me that we had a guest have issues with their door but it had been taken care of. All he had to do was come down to the desk and pick up the new keys.

11:30 comes around and a man walks out of the elevator looks at me and yells ""Send maintenance to fix my fucking door right now."" I will label him douche bag.

OP- I am sorry maintenance is gone for the night but how can I help you? Who are you?

DB- Mr. \*\*\*\*\*\* in room \*\*\*. I told them to fix my fucking door earlier and they did not! What the kind of service is this! I am so fucking pissed right now!

DB- Give me his card and write down your name. You don't seem like your trying to help me. Is this how you treat all the \*\*\*\*\* members! Its been more than 8 fucking hours and you guys haven't done shit.

I am just quiet at this point trying to not let him get to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I proceed to hand him my managers card as well as his new keys for the room and tell him ""these should work"". AND THIS MOTHERFUCKER takes out his business card and throws it at me saying ""have the manager call me in the morning"", starts walking away but his wife says we still have the old keys so he tosses them at the desk. I think this was the most I have been tested at the front desk and let me tell you guys I saw fucking RED. I can deal with assholes cussing and yelling but once you disrespect me like that, I draw a line. I go to the back office and just try to calm my breathing down and I even had to go to my car and take a hit before continuing my shift. Just felt like venting this out. Thanks!

"Hello fellow Front Office Associates, here's your Junior Night Supervisor from a Sharriott airport hotel to tell you a wonderful story of my crappy GM.

TL;DR is located at the bottom

Bring it back to last Saturday. I'm receiving stand-up from my PM MOD &amp; she tells me this.  ""A guest called earlier around 18:30 and complained that an associate ""barged into his room while he was changing"". The pm mod immediately apologizes to the guest and says we will investigate. She even gets housekeeping supervisor to call up and talk to him since based on his description it did involve a house-person.

The PM manager does a lock read (any tapping of a room key is tracked on the lock) and we see that no associate entered on Saturday, however on Friday about an hour after he checked in (he arrived at 12:30, housekeeping key was tapped at 13:30. PM MOD tried to call the guest to inform him but didn't get a chance to tell.

For context: Front office/ hskp do this program called S8s. Essentially to anticipate guest needs. So if your profile says u prefer foam pillows over feather, we would place foam pillows on your bed to make you feel welcomed.

So now it's 230am Sunday morning, middle of my shift, and he comes to check out. I explain the lock-read to him and hes not having any of it. He keeps cutting me off and essentially accusing the hskp ~~associate~~ ""perpetrator"" (his words) of just breaking into rooms and stealing shit. I tell him that's not the case and that he was there to deliver the foam pillows as per your \[2nd from the top shiny\] elite profile"" . He then tells me that  the pm mod and hskp supervisor are ""idiots"" for not handling situation better.

I told him id have the exec hskp investigate and get in contact with him personally via email.  He then demands to be fully refunded with 80,000 points for the two nights he was here. (For reference our hotel is categorized at 25k per night)  I told him we'd give him 10K (which he doesn't deserve tbh).

I emailed the exec hskp and CC'd the rest of my department supervisors since I was gonna be off Sunday night

So Monday night i come back and on Tuesday morning I speak to my FOM.  This is what i hear.

So come Monday morning. Before the exec HSKP could even sit down and investigate, our dictator GM goes to FOM &amp; FDM and says ""why didn't we just refund him, its a clear safety concern. And our FOM puts her foot down and says ""if it was a real safety concern why didn't he call down immediately after the hskp left his room. Why wait until 30 hours later to complain."" She continues, ""Let the exec HSKP do her job first and investigate""

So nothing happened Tuesday, i was off Wed night, so come Thursday night into Friday morning I see my FOM and ask for a follow up on this guy.  She throws me a box of tissues and tells me this

So the exec hskp emails him after following up and says exactly what i did. The associate was there to deliver the foam pillows. She also clarified that the associate had followed standard procedure and knocked 3 times and then entered. The guest was had the door closed in his private bedroom (he was in a suite) He emails back saying ""the guy didn't have any pillows in his hand clearly you don't know facts.  She replies ""hi sir, our foam pillows are located in the closet of each guest room. He went there to swap them out for the regular pillows so your pre-arrival would be more better, we were unaware that you checked in early""  So then he sends a long email via central customer care to the GM and FOM saying ""none of you guys are aware of the facts and how things operate. You hire people who are unaware of reality and facts and lack customer service skills. Everyone I've spoken to, including that \[direct quote ahead\] ""condescending night clerk with an attitude problem"" (that's me!!), to your head of housekeeping who blindly defend associates while they try to con other guests.

So after all this, after a HSKP doing his job correctly, calling him a perpetrator,  after directly insulting one junior supervisor, two supervisors and a member of the executive team... our GM gives him 40,000 POINTS!!!  My FOM &amp; I were both pissed.  And that's all she wrote.

TL;DR: A super shiny elite guest complains an associate ""barged into his room"" and felt unsafe, 30 hours after it happened, insulted 5 staff members, demands 80,000 points (just over 3 nights worth), was offered 10K by me,and our GM caves and gives him 40K instead.

\*\*Semi unrelated, this is about the 4th time our GM has overridden one of the Front Office leaders, if you want any more stories let me know.\*\*

"Another tale from the crazy night audit lady! 

The other night, a couple comes in to rent a room. Our rooms are running at about $100. I tell them this and the guy paying tells me he found the room online for $60. I do my own looking (we aren’t allowed to take people at their word or use their phone as reference) and the lowest rice there is $80. I tell them this and guy still tells me that it’s $60. His girlfriend then points out he selected a hotel that sounded similar, but was not our hotel. So, he takes the $80 rate and goes to his room. If this was the end of the story, I would not be writing this, I assure you.

Not even an hour later, he comes back down to the front desk carrying the sheets from his bed. This is how the conversation goes: 

Me- you guessed it. DB-guessed it again!

DB: These sheets have shit stains on them.

Me: *not even looking at them yet* Ew. Let me move you to another room, cause that’s gross.

DB: No, I wanna check out. That is disgusting.

Me: You want to check out? No problem. *voids the charges, checks him out, and hands him the receipt.* There you go. Have a good night!

DB: What is this?

Me: You wanted me to check you out, so I did.

DB: No, I wanted to leave. I want you to move my girlfriend.

Me: So you wanted me to move your room? I already offered you that and you told me to check you out. 

DB: No! I wanted to check out and you move my girlfriend to another room! I don’t want to pay for this cause there were shit stains on the sheets!

Me: I can either move the room or refund the room and check you out, sir. Those are the only options. *He actually has no options now, because I can’t reinstate his reservation since the audit had happened in that hour.*

DB: Fine! I’ll get the health board on this! They’ll shut you guys down!

Me: Of course. Have a good night!

He storms back off to the room and after about 8 minutes with no sign of him or his girlfriend, I call the room and let them know they have 5 minutes to vacate the property or I will have the police remove them. I stopped being afraid to call the cops a while ago.

After they left, I finally checked out the sheets, no shit stains. Looked more like another type of stain pertaining to bodily fluids.

But regardless of their efforts, one guest complained about his room (that was redone by a inspector and GM), 3 cancelled reservations, and the inspector and housekeeper were fired. (Rightfully)

"This literally just happened.

drugged out homeless person comes into the lobby, starts screaming, throwing one of our computers, kicking over tables and spilling a drink all over the floor. People are scared in the lobby, guests, kids, myself included. I call security and when they show up all they do is politely ask her to leave and keep their distance. They cant do anything they say. What the fuck, is the point then of having security if I don't feel secure then? We call the police, they say they are responding to other emergencies and show up 45 minutes later. 

In that time, she terrorized guests, destroyed our equipment, created a mess in our lobby we have to clean up and what does she get? Well, she said it herself. ""You cant do nothing to me, I'll go to jail, get a bed, free meal, be back tomorrow, I don't care!!!""

I've started carrying my pepper spray with me but this shouldn't be like this, I shouldn't be scared to come into work and feel like i need to do that. I know I shouldn't because I could be written up for carrying a weapon, but there were fucking children in the lobby and I would rather be fired for defending myself and others than let harm come.

I go through the checkin process delivering impeccable customer service even though I really shouldn't have, but I'm working on improving my departments Scores, so customer service mode is permanently activated. I have Chad insert his CC into the EMV reader for the deposit of RT+Inc of $50.

"I have wondered if this story would fit here for a while, but I think if fits well enough as it is hospitality related. Back in the mid 2010's, I was a supervisor for a company that managed parking for my state's fairground and expo center. Part of the responsibility we had was managing a string of campgrounds attached to the location. 

Every year, the fairgrounds hosted (and still does host) a gigantic horse show that lasts for 3 weeks officially, but about 4 weeks with setup. We would have around 200 RV's, campers, and live-in horse trailers in the main campgrounds alone, and we were filled to capacity in all of the backup spaces in the fairgrounds proper. Part of my job was managing those camping areas. I would check that people paid, take complaints, assist people with finding spots, and issuing camping permits. 

It was about 2 weeks into the show when this all went on. It was about 10:00pm and I was sitting and chatting with a city police officer enforcing a closed street as part of my nightly run through of the massive property. (fairgrounds take up both sides of the street and the road is closed down during major events.) After a few minutes of talking to him, I got a call from the show's stall office. A guest had a vehicle that was blocking the hitch to her camper and she needed to leave. Pretty unusual issue, but nothing that I couldn’t handle. The stall office gave me her space # and I asked them to have her meet me there. This is where the fun begins.

 I started to leave when my cellphone rang again. State police (fairground is state property, and has a patrol office with officers on duty) called me about the same guest. She had flagged down of their patrolling officers and gave them the same story. I let them know I was aware and was heading to the location. At this point, I am 10 feet from the officer I had been talking too and had yet to get my golf cart started to head that way when a truck pulls up alongside the officers booth. It was the same guest. She gave the officer her whole song and dance, so I waved her down and told her to head to her spot, and I will follow behind. At this point I figured she needs to get out of here pretty seriously if she is flagging down cops after being told we will help her. 

I finally get to her spot, and there is a car slightly blocking in her camper. I went ahead with the tow, and called a tow truck to move the vehicle. As I am getting the offending truck moved, the people that own it come over. They are a little worried seeing their car being moved, but I explain what's going on and let them know that they won't be charged anything for the relocation. The woman who needed to leave parked her truck with the front end facing her camper hitch (first red flag), goes inside it, and shuts the door. Realizing something was up at this point, I hung around the campground for about 30-45 minutes before I saw she wasn't intending to leave.

I went back to my office and started filling out a form so I could stick her with the fee for that entirely unnecessary tow. It was about 10 minutes later, when I got called again. It's the state police. The woman had started harassing her neighbor, yelling at them, and telling them to get out of ""her"" space. Now, the RV spaces are pretty big, and during shows like this, we usually put 3 people into 2 spaces, as there is more than enough room for it. I headed up and talked to the guest being harassed, while police tried to talk to the crazy guest. Police got the camper door slammed in their face, and they decide not to peruse it after talking to the guest getting harassed. The poor harassed guest decided she was just going to leave, as she was only going to stay for another night and didn't want to be near ""that psycho"" as she put it. I offered to move her to another space, comp this night etc. but she just wanted to go home, and I didn't blame her. I gave the guest a ride back to my office (as it was a bit of a far away), got her checked out refunded, and went on about my shift. 

That's when the police called me again. It had been about an hour since I checked out the guest that wanted to leave, making it around midnight when I received this call. The crazy guest had gone out to the main power box, and unplugged the 5 other campers plugged into the box (1 box per 4 spots, and another guest had come in and pulled into the vacated spot). I went out to talk to the officers that were already there (same ones as before) and we ended up calling one of the show organizers to come over as well. It resulted in a little impromptu conference between me, my manager on speaker phone, the police supervisor on duty, and the show representative. 

We came to a series of decisions. State police wanted her off the property. We and the show agreed. My manager decided we would not be refunding her, and the show would back us up on that. With the way camping worked there for big shows, we would sell camping as if you intended to stay for the rest of the show, and would refund you the unused days when you checked out, so that could have cost her anywhere up to $315 if she was originally planning to leave the next day. As for the cherry on top, it turns out that the crazy guest was a member of the horse association that hosts the show. I found out the next day in a follow up meeting with my manager that the horse association decided that her behavior was unacceptable and she was removed from the group, and banned from any of their events and shows.

"Night auditor.  This big ol' facepalm happened a couple nights ago.

Dude comes down around 2 AM, on his phone, pacing back and forth.  I poke my head out the office and ask if I can help him with anything.  He says,

""Naw, I'm just really trying to find my girlfriend.  We left the casino and agreed to meet back at the hotel, and she says she's in the lobby but ... ""

Both of us look at the empty lobby.  I say what he's thinking:

""...clearly she's not.""

""Right."" He says.

I tell him that I'm here if he needs anything in specific.  The conversation continues, I get to hear his side:

""Babe?  ...  No, Babe, I'm in the lobby, you're not.  ... No, babe?  Babe?  ....  Babe.  No, babe, I'M in the lobby.  ...  ... Okay, honey, I am literally standing where you paid the bill for our hotel room.  Ya.  I'm standing here, with the night clerk ... Yup, I am staring at our car.  So, where are you?  ... No.  Hon, we can't BOTH be in the lobby.""

At this point I suggested to him that perhaps she is in our south building.  He walks down.  Comes back.  He's still on the phone.

""No, I don't know where you are either.  ... Nope.  ... Ya know what?  Just stay where you are, wherever you are.  I'm gonna come find you.  ... No, I'm not driving.  Yes, I know, I know.  ... Because, I'm gonna find you and get you back here before you wind up in China or something.""

Dude takes off on foot.  I guess, just starts visiting hotels.  Returns 45 minutes later.  On the vestibule phone, he says he found her at The Sandman, a property about 10 minutes south of us.  He leads her, a very pretty, blonde, drunk lady, towards they elevator.  As they walk, he asks her,

""So.  Does this look a bit more familiar?""

""Yeah..."" She replied, dreamily.  ""Ya know, I wondered why my room key wouldn't work...""

...I'll bet you did, lady.  I'll bet you did.

"Stupid guests keep on surprising me, even after 3 years in the industry.

A guest calls down to me and complains that the room is too cold. And I work in a certain part of the world where it is quite cold now, so I understand that people coming from warmer areas need high temperatures to feel warm and comfortable. 
So I grabbed with me a small heater. We have many of them because we always get a “I’m-cold-call”, and I proceeded to knock on the man’s door. Not surprisingly, an obviously annoyed old man opened up the door and rushed me to our termometer. He told me that it was not working because it couldn’t be set higher than a certain degree, but I explained that unfortunately it is supposed to be so. However, some rooms are actually colder than others.  I then plugged the heater in the wall and said that the room soon would be warmer, while also explaining that I wish I could give him another room but that we are fully booked and I literally have no rooms. He got very annoyed and it seemed like he thought that I could magically create a new room for him. If the last room I had was a suite, he would get it to make him happy. I then said that he can come and get a better room tomorrow, he just kinda kicked me out of his room and on the way out, he said: “I think you gave very bad service, why don’t you just give me a new room?”, I answered with “I’m really sorry, but we are fully boo— 

*slams door in my face*

I couldn’t help but laugh on the way down and telling my colleague about this. Sometimes people are just so stupid and can’t even understand something as easy as: when you are fully booked, you have no rooms. Unless if you want to overbook and maybe have to turnaway another guest. Either way, someone is gonna complain 😂 thanks for reading!We were fully booked and I got told that I showed bad service because I couldn’t magically build a new room",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Not from the front desk but work in the hotel bar and restaurant.

There are people that expect too much, but 9/10x that seems to be a team member from another sister hotel. Like wtf? 

Tonight, we had to close our restaurant an hour early for maintenance. Well, we were *supposed* to. So at 9pm the chef starts his clean-up and I start my stocking at the bar. The bar wasn't closed until 10 but I only had regulars there and they were comfortable. Then, at 9:10, the front desk woman brings an order over from a room that housed a team member, her husband, and her teenage daughter. Granted, the FD woman KNEW the restuarant closed at 9 tonight, but she's such an incessant people-pleaser. Throw everyone under the bus to make herself look good, etc.

Oh well. The order has been taken, so I'll deliver it with 20% grat, as usual. Cool. 

Only, the woman and her man came down about 20 seconds before I was about to bring it up (~9:35) and says they're gonna eat it down here. At my bar. So I can clean it up and tend to them. Okay.

They order 2 top shelf drinks that require real mixology. I'm actually cool with that, I don't get to show off my skills in this bar usually as its a bunch of highballs and bourbon-on-the-rocks. So I mix them 2 PERFECT cocktails. Extra garnishes, perfect ratios, even a little extra liquor because they're (or, she's) a part of my company. They say they like them.

The kid shows up and eats her good 30 mins later. I have to reheat it which completely kills my chef's expert cooking, but whatever, she's happy, I'm happyish. At this point I only have 2 people at the actual bar, a regular and his friend. When I saw her finishing up I offered them last call. This is about 11:15 when the kitchen was supposed to close at 9, me at 10. They oblige and now I'm just waiting on this family. The Team Member's husabnd tries to hand an unsigned receipt back to me (throw it at me) saying ""ROOM"".

Uh, no?

""SIR, yeah, you have to SIGN your receipt. I don't know you. Also, you're SUPPOSED to fill out the tip and total line, as well as your room number.""

...how tf can I charge it to ""ROOM"" without you fcking telling me...

Anyways, I got $2 on a $67 order, which included two premium drinks from me specifically that they watched me prepare AND a discount on food. This is typical of team members. Fucking why???

I've stayed at a few sister hotels but only 2 that included the bar and restaurant and I ALWAYS tip 20% and if it's room service eith 20% grat included I include some cash bc that's not taxed. What is wrong with these people?

I know this ended up being kinda long, so thanks for reading. It was half rant... but surely we've all encountered entitled team members?

"I just found this sub and I worked as a night auditor many years ago and I have several stories from that time. 

Late at night is always get people coming in late at night expecting to find cheap deals. I could only give a Max of %10 off in the system for anyone so I always have really high prices then gave them regular prices to seem like it was a deal. Anyway I man pulled up and came in asking for the cheapest deal I had. And after telling him my normal high price then telling him the best I can do is the actual regular price. His exact words ""So if I send my daughter out back with you, how much will you take off the rate?"" I politely told him that is not something to say, and he awkwardly laughed it off and said he wanted a room. So I start the reservation for check in and he motioned out to his car and his wife and daughter get out and come in to the lobby. His fucking daughter was not even a teenager. She was 10-12 at most. When they came in and I saw how old she was, I pointed out again that his ""joke"",even if you can call it that, was not acceptable to be telling people. His wife then jumped his case, apparently he's made these jokes before and his wife knew exactly what I was talking about and ripped him a new one.A dude tried to use his daughter to get a cheaper rate....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Two ladies return to the hotel late at night.

One wants to be sure her keycard works, so asks to have it remade.

No problem.

I start logging into the system, when she decides she also wants a snack from our Grab&amp;Go area.

No problem.

She sets a granola bar on the counter as I ask her for the room number, and to confirm a couple pieces of information on the reservation before I make the new key and charge the item to it.

She gets the wrong room the first time, eventually correcting herself.

The information matches and I hand her a freshly written key.

""Can I have my granola bar back?"" She asks tiredly, and I notice that it is no longer on the counter. 

""Neither of us touched it."" Her friend, who has been silent up to this point, states.

The first lady looks confused, and puts her hands in her coat pockets about to maybe declare she didn't take it, where I'm sure her hand wraps around the wrapped granola bar, because I heard it.

Her face changes into one of exhausted embarrassment, and she mumbles, ""I'm really tired.""

"**TL;DR**: Guest brought and escort and the escort didn't have valid ID. Escort suggest they go back to her place to get her ID, but the guest refused. Trying to force the guest to either go get the escort's ID or go somewhere else, we informed the guest he would be charged an extra night in a different room if he really wanted us to let the escort in without ID. The guest paid, we checked them in, they said they would never stay with us again. It has been a year and four months and they still haven't returned.

So, as per my previous posts, I'm a night auditor, which is perhaps, the most soulless, position in the hospitality industry. Not only are we destined to not see the light of day, rather, spend our lives dwelling in shadows, forever running from light, but we are also destined to see some guests in their less than stellar moments. Usually guests are aware of them being in such a moment and will quite hastily comply with the night auditor's preposterous demands such as ""Sir, please keep it down, people are sleeping in this hotel"" and even ""I'm sorry sir, but you cannot smoke in the lobby, please go outside."" as well as many others humanly impossible requests.

Alas, some guests really do enjoy dragging their feet, fighting out a battle they cannot win, even when you explain it to them that it is over and you have the high ground. There was once one such guest, and as per my previous stories, it didn't work out too well. Now, luckly this time the night auditor had his colleague with him, there were no shouting matches and the night auditor didn't have to threaten placing a call to the local constabulary about a drunk and disorderly guest. But boy, oh boy was he drunk and disorderly!

See, I don't know what it is about business trips, but apparently it is good practice to take your business partners out to peruse some more exotic meats, the kind that walk and talk and if you pay their asking rates and treat them nice, will even confort you from the dire feeling of loneliness you're experiencing from being away from the missus. You see where I'm going with this, right? The guest brought an escort!

As is our procedure, we quite cheerfully greeted the guest, despite him having a very pungent smell and putting up putrid clouds of what smelled like two days old roadkill marinated in cheap whiskey Then we turned to his escort, and asked to see her ID. By this point, dear reader, you must've figured out that she didn't have her ID, who knows, maybe she forgot it at her one actual pair of pants back home because, well, skirts don't have pockets and even if they did, it would probably just slow her down. And this is where everything started to go wrong.

See, Mr. Lonely Businessman was not having any of it, and right off the bat stated ""I paid for the room, so I can take up whoever I want and you can't do a thing about it."" Being an experienced creature of the night and a shrewd hotelier, our hero (or perhaps villain?) kindly informed the lonely businessman, that things did not work like such, and as per hotel rules and for security reasons, she had to provide valid ID. We even went as far as to try and nudge him in the right direction by telling a very peculiar story about an italian man who had his passport stolen by an escort, who was now threatening to tell his better half about his unsavory adventures. This, sadly didn't work, then again you can't quite reason with some drunk people, especially horny drunk people.

Alas, his companion and soon to be entertainer did try to de-escalate the situation by suggesting that they could take a cab back to her place so she could get her ID and they'd be back in a jiffy, but she was also met with negative responses. By this point, Mr. Businessman is slowly, but surely turning the tide of this battle, not with his intellectual brilliance, but rather the overwhelming power of his rhetoric (In other words, his foul breath). Seeing as things are not going to go anywhere and in order to prevent the situation from getting even worse, our beloved hoteliers hatched a cunning plan which would surely give them the upper hand from a tactical standpoint, and informed the guest that if he did want to go up to a room with his escort, without her presenting ID, he would be charged for an extra night and he would have to pick a different room (so as to not risk getting his belongings stolen).

Bear with me, most people, even drunk horny people, will usually come to their senses (somewhat) when money is involved. In this case, since the hotel was about 3/4 full, a night would be about 6 times what the hotel would normally charge a guest for bringing an escort. Surely after hearing this, our shrewd conquistador wouldn't mind getting a cab with his female company to go get her ID. However, in a totally unexpected move, worthy of being immortalized in the anals of the front desk's logbook, the guest grumbled loudly, pulled out his credit card and said ""charge it"". Seeing as their plan backfired on them, the night auditors, unable to manuever themselves out of their own trap, did just that, charged the card, had the escort fill out her check-in form, and gave them a room far away from the other rooms.

Surely this is the end right? Well, no. Not sufficiently happy with this tactical victory, Mr. Lonely Businessman started to gloat about it and even taunt the night auditors. ""I've been staying here every two months for the last 4 years, you guys are toast!"", followed by a ""Seriously? Did you seriously need to charge me for another room? Was it really necessary? Not cool, man."" and as for the coup de grâce, ""I am never coming to this hotel again and your manager won't be happy about it!.

Gasping for air, our hero hurriedly gave the foul smelling creature and his unlucky escort the key to their love nest, hidden away at the end of a hallway on an empty floor. After their quick departure, he set about chronicling the events in the logbook, and asked his aide to make a note on the guest's file ""Guest is extremely rude"", however, two discoveries were made. The first, being that the guest used a corporate card to pay for the room, and as such, would surely be asking for a invoice. The second? The guest already had a note saying he was quite rude on his file, detailing his last stay where he threatened to never come back again.

Not one to be content with being bested in a trial by combat, our hero set about drafting the invoice,  and making sure that in some unremarkable place within this invoice, it stated ""Hotel stay for Ms. Escort"". The guest would not see it, perhaps even his company would not see it, but it didn't matter, as the guest had quite gently put it ""I own the damn company who booked my room you jackass!"" but the night auditor would not let this defeat go lightly.

The next morning, the front desk manager called the night auditor and asked what happened. After being regaled with this tale, the manager explained that it was not the first time they had trouble with this guest and that hopefully this time, the guest would follow through with his threat to never set foot in this hotel again.

So far, it has been precisely, 1 year and 4 months since the guest last stayed in the night auditor's realm, which was precisely that fateful night. In the end, Mr. Lonely Businessman showed himself to be not only a shrewd businessman, conquistador of hearts, master tactician, but ultimately, a man who follows through with his threats.

"Okay so...

I haven’t been in the hospitality industry long, I also work at a very “budget brand” hotel.. I like to think it’s decent.. I feel like your getting good value for the rates (currently.. how high our nightly rates go in the summer is ridiculous idk why anyone would pay that).

So we had our quality audit today.. I don’t know how common that is in different hotels but I would assume it’s standards, someone coming and inspecting the condition of the rooms your renting. 

Well there are a few things that if they are messed up you instantly fail your audit. Obvious stuff like, the door locks have to function... no exposed wiring... fire alarms... window locks.. etc.. very obvious stuff that if you don’t have it’s a safety and security issue. They also check that your FD is knowledgeable about the area very simple stuff...

We failed.

All because one room which was not supposed to be rentable had a busted door latch. This is something we all knew about and was supposed to be in the system as unrentable but for some reason.... was not. So of course everybody started throwing the blame on different directions. I am the MOD so I shit all that down, said the blame wasn’t on anyone except for me and the GM. The rest of the audit was great, the auditor even said we had the cleanest rooms of any in our region, that our FD absolutely demolished all the attempts to trip her up. We did phenomenal! But that doesn’t matter because we failed.... obviously I’m bummed... I spent 14 hour at the hotel last night making last minute attempts to clean and somehow between me my gm my hhk and maintenance we missed this... we’re not gonna let it bring us down and we’re only gonna improve. 

BUT! Of course it ruined my day... and I was fortunate enough to have to work the evening shift... and it went horribly! A guest that stayed last night came in demanding a refund because the room smelled bad, and wasn’t cleaned. I asked the very simple “did you inform staff last night?” And got the “I shouldn’t have to inform staff I’m telling you the room was bad and the customer is always right” and I hit him with the “sorry to hear that, unfortunately this is a hotel, you are not a customer you are a guest... there’s a big difference” and went through that whole thing, basically told him to take his tweaker ass off my property as nicely as possible. If there’s a problem with a room I give people an hour which our policy is 15 mins. If he woulda said something at any point anyone would have moved him to a new room... it’s winter we got rooms for days...

Then right when I was ready to end shift... my NA has literally walked into the lobby I get hit up by Karen... 

“We haven’t received housekeeping at all during our stay” 
“I’m so sorry ma’am let me look into it for you, oh it looks like my housekeepers tried to get in to service but your husband had told them no service”
“You dirty freaking lier! No ones been to our room my husband wouldn’t have turned it away this place is fight! I’m calling corporate and I WILL be getting a refund!!”
“Ok, there number is right there on the wall. have a good night” and I started printing off my end shift paperwork

“Are you really gonna ignore me now???”
“I’m sorry, I thought we were done. I assumed you just wanted the corporate number, what else can I do for you?”
“I want your name!”
Literally wearing a jacket with my name on it... my name tag on the opposite side of said jacket... and a big old sign right behind me with my name “manager on duty
“I’ll give you my card!, anything else?”
“ I want your managers name!”
“I’ll give you his card!, anything else?”
“Yeah I want my refund!”
“Call corporate.”

I really like working in this industry, but good god I hate this place I’m at... everyday there at least one bs thing that’s gotta happen...I’m sick of it..Total rant you won’t be able to follow...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"While we were during the slow season at the hotel with about 5 - 15 check-ins it was fine to be alone because we were sitting at a cool &gt;25% occupancy, and I never really felt like I saw most guest besides checking them in. Now we are picking up to averaging about 65 - 100% every day (only hit that 100% when we have a big group coming in).

I went from literally sitting in the back office watching videos on my phone, stuffing my face with whatever sounded good on Postmates, to not being able to take a lunch break, or any break at all. Waiting for a second of peace so I can put the ""Front Desk Agent Will Return Momentarily"" sign up and run up stairs to ""try"" and go to the bathroom. I say ""try"" because I'm usually full of anxiety and KNOWING the second I walk back downstairs there is going to be a line of people. 

We have a mid shift from 10 AM - 6 PM which helps with the check ins. But I think the real problem is after the guest are checked in. If we are around 75%+ we should ALWAYS have 2 people at the desk all night, mainly because most of those people that checked in now want Pillows, Blankets, Towels, Need the Wifi Password, Calling to ask General Questions, ect. It is alot for one person. I am checking in a guest, and having two people calling me at the same time, putting them both on hold only to have them hang up and call me back a minute later asking me, ""WhY i PuT tHeM oN hOlD sO lOnG!?"" ...With two people it is great because you can both take a call/check a guest in or what I like to do is take turns so no one is answering majority of the calls or checking in majority of the guests.

Honestly I am getting a little burned out, I am fine and peppy until about 7pm which is my usual lunch break time (I use that to get a great meal in, and watch a you tube video or a 30 minute episode of a TV Show. It's a great way to kind of shut my brain off and relax for a uninterrupted 30 minutes). Then when 9pm hits I can sense my mood and demeanor change. I will say everything with my customer service voice but my expression is more blank, emotionless, tired. By 11pm I am begging to go home, using the last bit of my energy to explain to the night auditor about the night, to pass on any notes and to change and FINALLY GO HOME.

"I just found this sub and I worked as a night auditor many years ago and I have several stories from that time. 


I came in one saturday night and was told there was drugs in the office because a guest found it in their room and 2nd shift didn't know what to do with it so the GM (that was home) said to just leave it in the office for her to deal with on monday.

So this is what happened....

A guest that had been staying with us for almost a month found a bag of drugs and other drug ""stuff"" under her mattress, like almost in the middle of it. The only reason she found it was she was hiding her medical pot under the mattress. She was staying at our hotel because she was getting specialized cancer treatment in a different state and her home state had legal medical pot but not our state.

Anyway so I wasn't comfortable knowing that there was hardcore drugs just sitting in the office so I called a friend of mine who is/was a local cop and told him what our guest found in her room and he said just wait for him and he's come over and let me surrender the drugs to him and no one would get in trouble. Let me add that I didn't rat our her pot, all I told him was about the hardcore stuff found.

So he gets there later, thankfully he was on duty that night to help me out with this. He puts on protective gloves and opens the bag and starts looking at what's in it and he figured out it was meth and the amount in the bag was upwards of $3k worth (a dealer bag apparently) he said some dealer was pissed for forgetting that in their room lol.You found what under the bed?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

So at my old hotel we had a snack closet area next to the front desk for guests to buy stuff instead of having a vending machine. The freezer in this snack area was never filled by management so I usually put my grocery bag frozen dinner in the back of it since I was the night auditor.

It was a hungryman frozen dinner, and one night I notice a guest go in there and walk out carrying my grocery bag. I meet him at the elevator and politely inform him that he has my lunch to which he obviously denied it. I told him it was on camera showing him stealing my lunch,which it was. He started getting VERY upset that I was accusing him and threatened to beat me up. I told him he can give me MY lunch back or I can have the police remove him from the property. It was then he threw the first punch.it was a bit of a brawl but I managed to knock him out and I put my lunch back and called the cops.blah blah blah the cops remove him and his stuff and I ban him from the property.

First post here, please be kind.

One of my staff just checked-in a honey moon couple into the room they booked. They called me (duty manager), furious that they didn't get an upgrade for this special occasion. TBF there was a written request on the booking saying something like 'please make our stay extra special as it is our honey moon'. Cool....

Why don't THEY make THEIR stay extra special themselves by booking a larger room (a suite or else) is beyond me. Did they get a wedding ring half price because it was a special occasion as well ? wtf is wrong with these people ? Since when is getting what you paid for an insult ? We (the hotel) never promised any extra service for honey mooners (partly because we don't want them btw) so why the hate ?

Well congratulations !!! Now that your now wife knows how much of a greedy fuck you are, I'm sure your stay is extra special.

"Slow night at the hotel I work at. Just a 79 room hotel with a generous cancelation policy of 6pm day of arrival.

"I don't really know why I enjoy reading this sub so much. I've never worked in a hotel or anything like that. Maybe it's just because I really enjoy staying in hotels. I try to be a good guest and mind my own business and not be any trouble, because there's almost never anything worth causing trouble about (although I did post here once before as penance for being an officious prick to a front desk worker, and I don't want to repeat that).

I used to travel for work 7 or 8 times a year, now down to 2 or 3. There was one hotel I used to stay in a lot, a very nice one, in suburban Washington D.C. Great staff, great rooms, right in a downtown area, right off the Beltway. I always enjoyed staying there.

Except for the time they lost my car. Well, not even MY car - it was a government vehicle I was using for the trip. I was checking out and I handed the FDA my slip to give to the valet service. ""Here's the slip for my car.""

She peered at her computer screen. ""Uhh ... we don't show that you have a car with us.""

A sense of creeping dread started to wash over me. ""Well, I gave the valet service my keys when I got in last night. I have the slip right here.""

She looked again. ""No, I'm definitely not seeing anything. Are you sure you left the car here?""

I showed her my slip again, and she shook her head again. The sense of dread was quickly turning into anger. ""Tell me you did NOT JUST LOSE my GOVERNMENT vehicle. Which I gave to YOUR VALET SERVICE LAST NIGHT."" There was nothing else the FDA could do. She called the valet manager, who looked for my keys in the key box. Nothing. The poor FDA called the manager. I was so angry I couldn't see straight, but I tried pretty hard to keep it together since it still wasn't clear what had happened. Left unsaid was the worst-case scenario: theft.

The manager, the valet manager, and I ended up looking on all four underground levels of parking. We found the car. Now we had to figure out where the keys were. They put in a call to the valet worker who had taken my keys to see if he had accidentally taken the keys home or something else. In the meantime I tried to not explode with a complimentary breakfast buffet. I wasn't really hungry. The manager assured me that if the keys couldn't be found, they would hire a locksmith at hotel expense to come out and make a new set. That didn't make me feel any better since I would still be on the hook for the original keys and the government-issued gas card attached to the key ring. Without the originals, I would probably not be allowed to use a government vehicle again and was facing other probable write-ups.

About two hours later, they found the keys on the floor of some other guy's car, where the valet had accidentally dropped them.

The manager apologized profusely and gave me like a million points on my hotel rewards account. I wasn't rude, but I probably was not extremely gracious either since I just wanted to get home at that point.

Next time I had to stay over in the area, I stayed at the same place. Same great hotel with the same great rooms as always. But the valet service was gone and the underground lot was now self-park.The Time the Hotel Lost My Car",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work as night audit for a mediocre hotel chain. We are right off the interstate along with two other hotels. Every year, our hotel and the hotel across the street from us (Nights Out) sell out entirely to the local military institute. The hotel on the hill behind us, let's call it Joho's only sells some of their rooms because they find the cadets to be too rowdy for them. 

Well, this time of year they have their winter formal. This all happened on Valentine's weekend. Because there are so many cadets they let the upperclassmen have theirs on Friday and then the lowerclassmen had theirs on Saturday. Friday went okay, other than a cadet had to be taken back to barracks after getting seriously ill. So the colonel jokingly said not to wake him up at 3 AM the next night.

So, of course, all hell broke loose at 3 AM on Saturday. It's my first winter formal with them, so I was not prepared AT ALL. Suddenly the two security officers sitting watching the cameras check their phones and rush out the door. I asked if something happened at one of the other hotels and they said yes. Shortly after a deputy and the colonel from across the street pull up out front. And a cadet comes jogging over from our back parking lot. They talk and then the cadet comes in and asks to sit in the breakfast area until the deputy comes back. The deputy and colonel leave, and then the colonel comes back five minutes later. He comes in and starts questioning the cadet.

What I eavesdropped from that:

The cadet's girlfriend was on the balcony when she saw a car drive over the side of the parking lot and crash on the hill of the Joho's behind us. So her boyfriend calls 911 and the colonel before running across the street to help the car. It was another blindingly drunk, underage, cadet who we will call John. He helps John get out of the car. John rips his own shirt off and goes running down to the road. The cadet barely stops him from getting squished by a truck. John runs off into the woods, starting the search currently going on.

It's at this point that I hear footsteps on the roof of the lobby. A loud bang. Then nothing. I look out the window but see nothing. But I say something to the colonel anyways. So he runs outside, runs back in and gets the first cadet. John had jumped from the roof. He was okay. The roof he jumped from thankfully was just over a story high and he landed in bushes which is why I couldn't see him. Just our lobby roof and not the four stories it could have been. He was not trying to kill himself, but trying to get away because he knew he was in trouble.

The EMT's come out of the woods to help him. His face and knee are busted and he's on the brink of being hypothermic. So I run and get a blanket while they bring him into the lobby. I called my boss because I have no access to the cameras. 

The state police get involved because he was drinking and driving. And last we heard John was kicked from the institute.

The thing that bothers me is that the school rents out the hotels for these kids to drink knowing half of them aren't old enough to drink. They make them check-in before security comes, and then they won't let them leave their rooms so they have plausible deniability and can say they must have brought the alcohol before security got there. Because the students pay for the rooms the school doesn't have to monitor what happens inside. These kids have been in such a strict environment that when they get an inch of freedom they take five miles. 

Tl:dr Military university freshman gets drunk and crashes his car. While running from cops jumps off a one-story roof and can't run anymore.Winter Formal From Hell",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"If you read my other posts, I mentioned my current GM isn't the best and I suspect she is trying to replace all the staff she hired with the old supervisor. Well, today I got a ""write up"" for a day I didn't work, for an incident I tried to fix but wasn't allowed to.

So what happened? I missed the meeting room which should have been set up the night before I worked or at least reminded about if PM was unable to get to it. It's both the PM and Night Audit's job to make sure the room was ready for guests. Well, it so happens the night I worked I got distracted by guests checking in super late (like just before roll over at 2 am) so my usual night schedule was mixed up and I was already late on breakfast set up along with pre-checkout. I am also doing NA because I was forced to and had already (from the moment I was hired/during the interview) mentioned that I rather not do nights because I tend to struggle with the first night if things don't go with routine, plus life happens during the day and I can't balance my schedule with nights.

Anyway, on the day of the ""incident"" I actually remembered to check our meetings folder and noticed that there was a meeting scheduled for the evening. Half asleep as I was, I informed the current supervisor that I missed the meeting room and offered to stay an extra 30 minutes to set it up properly if it wasn't already. Well, one of our Laundry Ladies flies out of the back going on about how horrible it was that I didn't get the meeting room done, and how I need to be talked to, and it's the end of the world, etc, etc...

Well, the supervisor at first began to agree with me to let me just set up the meeting room, the Laundry Lady just goes ""KisaTheMistress doesn't deserve overtime for her mistake! I already ask [maintenance] to help *me* set it up. She will just have to talk with [current GM] tomorrow."". I just tell the supervisor it's no big deal if I don't put down the half hour, since it was my mistake . But, Laundry Lady was already texting the GM about the *horror* she witnessed, so my supervisor just got a text telling her to tell me just to go home for the day.

Now about 3 weeks later, here I am pulled into the office after another stressful NA I didn't ask for, and finally 'talked to' about the incident... except I had talked already with the GM about missing the meeting room and how AM/Laundry seemed perfectly fine with setting it up themselves, like 3 days after when I got the chance to talk with her and apologized for the mistake.

The whole time I'm sitting there and my GM is saying she told me to get it done the day before... the day I didn't work... I tell her I didn't work on that date I worked the day after, she said she didn't care, it was *my* job (even though for the past 3 days both the other NA and PM could have got it done, according to the meetings folder) to set up the meeting room. Then she began vaguely threatening me with my job, saying ""your super awesome at taking constructive criticism and you don't have to worry about losing your job or anything... unless this happens every time on your shift. Not saying it will or I am expecting it to, since your good at correcting things right away. Don't lose any sleep over this, it's just going to sit in your file. Three more and your suspended, but don't worry about losing your job right away. Your doing great here!""

I have the full conversation recorded and with me denying I was ever told I was specifically told to have the meeting room set up on that date. Also, explaining why the supervisor wouldn't let me correct my mistake. (Which she claims I said the meeting room wasn't my ""priority"", when I only said I wasn't able to get to that part of the shift right up until the supervisor arrived and we were talking about something that reminded me of the meeting room. I never used the language ""priority"" with her.)

This GM doesn't investigate incidents, nor ""remembers"" conversations when it's convenient for her. She also rarely works and is hard to get a hold of if your NA to discuss problems. Hell, I suspect she wrote me up only because I refused a shift last week because of my other job and I wasn't willing to cover a shift with only 5 mintues of warning before said shift.

Fuck this, I'm recording this crap and as soon as I can snag a fulltime (or part time, she forced me on casual despite promising 32 hr at least at time of hiring), I am going to compile a full report and send it off to both her boss and Labour &amp; Standards for investigation formally. I should at least get my $250 she owes me because she ""forgot"" my scheduled raises until another employee noticed and complained, yet refused back pay.

If she's already threatening me, I know exactly where this bullshit is heading and I need to make sure I can get a hold of my lawyer to clean this up, in case it hits a fan.

(Sorry if this rant doesn't fit, but it seems to be a theme of poor management and pattern I've observed from her/past poorly managed places.)And so it starts.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My hotel seems calm and friendly but sometimes late at night we’ve got some shady characters, I’ll start with what happened when I got on shift this afternoon.

I clock in and and while the first shift gsr is doing paperwork they tell me the info on what’s happened for today and mention that the police are currently ‘talking to roomXYZ’ , says it like no big deal, not sure what it’s about they haven’t said anything to us about it. So I’m like okay, it happens, and this is around 1 pm broad daylight could be nothing. So first shift leaves and it’s just me and my manager. A little while later my manager is like come watch this. 

She rewinds the security footage from outside that room today, and at first she’s upset because we see people walking out of that room and they just keep coming. Seriously it was like watching a clown car, at least 8-10 people come out and we’re like wtf. Now myself and the night auditor have been telling my boss they’d been causing mild issues and were shady and up to something for days by this point. So all these people keep coming out of this room and are just hanging around the cars parked in front of the door. And then we see (at least) 5/6 different regular looking cars swarm up on the area.

It was seriously so well coordinated my boss is like this looks like something out of a freaking movie. All these cars move in at once out of nowhere, and one of the guys outside bolts back into the hotel room. That’s when 10+ guys in plain clothes get out of these and run up with guns drawn and start grabbing people and putting the guns to their heads and I’m like OH SHIT ITS A FUCKIN GANG WAR OUT HERE WTF. 

Turns out it’s all undercover police lol it seriously looked fucking wild on camera though, and I’m glad it happened because something was definitely really wrong with that bunch of people.

SO

That happens, meanwhile I’ve got a guy come up to the desk that had checked in last night. He had checked in for only one night and it’s well past check out, he’s no longer in the room. Has all his stuff out, rooms been cleaned and re-rented to a nice couple. So at first I’m like oh okay you wanna check in for another night. This guy.

This guy has shoulder length hair and a drug rug sweater, a dog and a backpack and I had checked him in the night before, seemed to be a traveling hippie type from up north. Was nice, a little stoner if anything lol. So when I see him today I’m not thinking anything.

And then when he gets to the desk he lays across the top of the desk and looks up at me and his eyes are all glassy and he’s telling me his brain doesn’t work and he’s about to pass out and something about a confirmation number but he is just straight up out of it. We don’t have a reservation for him and he doesn’t wanna check in and it’s just weird and awkward because he’s not even on the same plane of reality as the rest of us right now and he starts saying shit like I know you get this folder(??) all the time but you’re just so beautiful etc. to be honest I don’t even remember what exact words were exchanged cause the guys just. Gone.

So I’m like cool, he must be trippin on acid or something because of the look in his eyes and the stuff he was saying and how he was acting. So he leaves the lobby with no incident and I walk back and let my manager know what’s up and she’s like ‘oh no’ kinda like dang what a shame. She’s like let me know if he comes back. So he does come back and its a little more frustrating this time and he just still is all over he place not comprehending anything etc. 


So he leaves again and my manager walks out ( she was on the phone and we’re not to disturb her while she’s in a phone call so I didn’t get the chance to let her know while he was at the desk) and is like was that him? And I’m like yeah so she walks out and sees him in the parking lot and goes to talk to him, comes back and is like yeah that dudes way gone, I told him he had to leave (but nicely) and he agreed.

Well

Buddy comes back about three times being the same way

My boss gets to the point where she’s like if he starts to be too much of an issue tonight, call the police if you can’t handle it.

She leaves for the night

Dude comes back multiple times AGAIN AND AGAIN

At this point it’s night time, he’s saying shit like I just got a room an hour ago I’m like buddy that was YESTERDAY he’s still just completely tripped out of his mind but now he’s less tripped out, zoned out and harmless, and starting to get more and more aggressive, confused and ridiculous. So finally one of these times I’m in the parking lot telling him he needs to leave yet again and he starts screaming and cussing me out and another guest who was outside an older man is trying to calmly get him to leave with me and he’s hollering the whole way but walking off the property. 

Well awhile later and he’s back AGAIN and I tell him to leave AGAIN and he’s angry and I’m finally like fuck this I walk inside and call the non emergency police and they send someone. Mind you I didn’t call them before because it would seem like dude was gone with no sign of him but bam an hour later he’d show up again. So I call he police they say they’re sending someone, as I’m on the phone with him I see he’s like trying to get into a random room now and I’m like Jesus Christ. 

So when I get off the phone with the police I look up the where dude was and he’s gone. But his dog and backpack and still sitting right at the door he’d been trying to get into (she was a good dog bless her heart) so I’m like shit where’d he go.

SO

I lock the lobby and go to the stairs right by the lobby, going up to the second floor (outside walkways) so I can get a better view of the property and see if I see the guy anywhere. I get to the top of the stairs and low and behold he’s right freakin there trying to get into another random room. So I say (nicely) hey man, what’re you doing? 

This man looked up from the door at me with the scariest fucking dead eyes , I can’t even describe that look to be honest once he looked at me I was immediately like oh shit I’m in trouble and it was a split second, I said that, he looked up, and then he started to rush me. 
So I instantly starting running backwards away from him and I’m like what’re you doing?!?!? As I’m running and he gets closer and this is all happening really fast, at the same time in my peripherals I saw a police car turning into our property and I’m running from the fucking guy and he’s chasing me and I fucking flew down the stairs and he’s right behind me and right as I hit the bottom of the stairs the cop is jumping out of his car and I’m flying past the cop and the cop is running the opposite way and I’m just like THATS THE GUY and the cop grabs him from behind me and i just kept running, I just bolt to the lobby and I’m like WHAT.THE.FUCK. 

I mean seriously that wasn’t some kind of weird situation, that was me running as fast as my feet could take me and the guy barreling down right on me desperately trying to fucking get me. 


Right then the night shift girl walks ima nd she’s likes what the fuck happened?!? She was pulling up right as the cop was too, from the other direction and her and the cop both had plain view of me running from this guy on the second floor and down the stairs. She’s like when I saw you I was hoping you just laid he dude out you should’ve just started fighting and to be honest it was that kind of situation. If I didn’t think I could make it down to where the cop was in time then I was going to have to fight this dude because he was definitely coming at me to hurt me. If I hadn’t of called the police earlier and them show up right then I would’ve had no choice but to fight the guy. It’s just insanity.


It’s just crazy to me we have to deal with stuff like this. Every night I’m the only person on staff in the entire hotel. It’s just me. And it’s like that for all of us gsr’s. Only one person on staff, and at night housekeeping etc. is long gone. And crazy crap like this or drug dealers or tweakers etc happens and we’re solo here. My boss only hires young pretty girls for the desk too because of course it’s better for reviews or some shit idk. But it’s insane. And apparently all the shit and situations that happen don’t happen ENOUGH for corporate to spring for us to have a night security guard. Like seriously? We’re also not allowed to lock the lobby up at night and use the bulletproof window. I’m just like okay so what you’re saying is it’s basically the Wild West out here and I better start carrying a knife to work?!?

We have faithful regulars and bless their fuckin hearts because they know how it is and often make sure to tell us if ANYTHING happens that they will back us up and come to our rescue at any time, they also often come by the lobby at night just to check on us. I even had one regular call the police once because I wasnt at the desk at night and she couldn’t find me for a worrying amount of time. (Someone’s electronic door key reader thing went out and I was desperately trying the emergency keys to get them in their room) but goddamn it’s good know that at least SOMEONE would notice if I was gone and something had happened to me.


Sorry for the book, rant for the night over , thanks for reading.

Also, I’m sorry if from my retelling it doesn’t seem like the guy was dangerous and ridiculous but he was it’s just hard to remember every exact thing that happened because it was so much today. But trust and believe that dude was insane on drugs and a huge problem. I’m not so good at conveying it accurately I apologize. And also my boss wants us to do this, if we see an issue like this we are SUPPOSED to go out and confront it etc. , not call the police until we absolutely have to, which is insane but what can you doI got chased today",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"So one day I am working front desk at my hotel, mind you, shitty hotel.   So I get a call from a guest ""you gotta come down here, someone is threatening to shoot someone"". I am thinking ""well that is the exact reason I should not go there."" but to be sure I enter the hallway and  20 people in the hallway, every guest is there and were like ""you need to call 911"" I'm like ""why didn't you?"".  Anyways, pull out my phone walking to the office.

""911 how may I direct your emergency?""

""I work at shitty hotel, apparently one of my guests is threatening to shoot other guests""

911: Did you see the gun he intends to shoot them with?

Me: No, I hope not to

911: ok, are you sure there is a threat?

Me: well apparently at least 20 people witnessed this

911: ok, we'll get around to sending a police officer there.

Me: thanks?

\*30 minutes later\*

A Police car shows up around the time the guy that is threatening to shoot people happens to be walking to the office.

Police Officer talks to this guy, I am expecting the police officer to come talk to me next, nope, he is fine, he gets in his Crown Vic and drives off.

Afterwards I call the non-emergency line with my manager ""WTF? why didn't your guys even talk to me?""

""fine we'll send someone out""

So when the PD shows back up we know this guy is gone, give them a room key and all they find is a BB Gun, we were lucky that is all it is, but I feel like the local PD failed us.

We added him to our Do Not Rent List and that was it.

We were right on the line between Sheriff and Police Department.  Calling 911 got the Police but technically the Sheriff still had jurisdiction.

Awhile later some high ranking member of the Sheriff department came to us and asked if we would provide them with a room for them to do surveillance.  ""yeah sure, this room doesn't have working water, but come down here when you need it."" and so on.

They gave us their number for when we needed it and it was faster than 911 and got more results.Useless Police.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I am sure everyone on this community has had to deal with the backlash of giving somebody a complimentary upgrade and them being annoyed at you. Well this was a new one for me...

I am working the night shift at my property, not audit we just close late, and we had 4 check ins left at 10PM. Luckily 2 of the 4 arrived just as I was going to close the pool and the third had called back saying she was minutes away. The guest who was still headed to our property was originally booked in one of our standard rooms by suckspedia. When she arrived I told her that she got a complimentary upgrade from the basic room to one of our suites. She gave me a weird look and I was expecting to be yelled at because the basic room was her absolute favorite and she only wanted that...but she started complaining stating that she had originally booked one of the suites, not the basic room. I explained to her that its not a problem since we didn't charge her extra for the room change and we put her in a room that she wanted. But she insisted on having me sit there for 10 minutes while she fished through her email trying to find the original confirmation to show me that she booked the suite (that once again she was going to stay in anyways). Well ten minutes pass and I have already written notes about the interaction in her reservation since my manager is insistent on having us document every single interaction we have with guests. Well low and behold she found the email and what did it say you ask? Well of course it said ""You have reserved a \[standard room\]."" She went red in the face and was explaining how it was her companies fault and she only wanted to stay in the suite and she was going to pay extra to have one of those rooms. I told her again that we gave her a complimentary upgrade to the suite so she was going to be in one regardless...

"I've worked and helped out at a couple hotels and have seen some odd reviews. But, the strangest ones have to be when they complain about what news channel is on during breakfast.

I first heard about this being a thing last year from a coworker who saw a review from someone complaining about Foxy News being on during breakfast, but I wrote it off as a one time wack occurrence. 

Then recently I saw a hotel I used to work for get a low score simply for having Seenn on for 2 of the guest's stays. He said everything else was good, but he was outraged it was on for two consecutive stays and insisted there was no remote available to change it (even though I know we kept the remote in the lobby and my old GM responded there is in deed the ability to change the channel).

"In the 90s I was a front office supervisor at a busy downtown 5 Star hotel in a Northern Canadian city. Each summer our city had a festival for street performers. It ran for about 10 days, and was held in a city park only a block from our hotel. As tourism was not one of our larger segments, summers were often slow, and sales would offer the street performers a group rate. I initially questioned whether we wanted to have this segment of traveller stay in the hotel, and whether they could really afford it, but as I found out they were not only exceptionally nice and well mannered people, but that street performing at festivals was also extremely lucrative. Some people pulled in $1000 a day in tips.

I’m sure it was an opportunity for these folks to stay at a much better class of hotel than they normally would, and it was enthusiastically received, resulting in us being sold out for most of the 10 day stretch. I was on a 3 to 11 shift one day the second day of the 10 day festival, things were slow at the desk as we were sold right out; 313 out of 314 rooms. Housekeeping, bell staff, room service, and F&amp;amp;amp;amp;B were, as to be expected, hopping.

The 314th room at this hotel was called The Royal Suite room 2510. It was a luxuriously appointed room, that was three times the size of a normal room, and was two stories tall, with floor to ceiling windows. It connected to the Ambassador Suite that contained a Murphy bed and a corner King suite on the other side that were on the same floor and, via a sweeping circular staircase to the Ambassador Suite on the 26th floor.

The Royal Suite itself however, did not have a bed or a bedroom, when it needed a bed it was sold with one of the connecting bedrooms. It did have a dining room table for 12, and a very large sectional sofa that could seat at least a dozen people around a 50 inch projection screen TV. By rearranging the furniture, a space could be created where you could set up a small theater, or U-shape with some A/V so you could use it as a small meeting room, that was often utilized as a meeting space for smaller, but higher end, event clients.

Only once in the five years that I worked at this hotel, did I see the entire four room complex rented out. It was when a extremely well-known piano playing performer, with a penchant for weird eyeglasses stayed in our hotel. We had to bring in a dismantled grand piano and set it up in the Royal suite, and have a piano tuner come in, however that is another story for another day. The cost was $3500 a night, a substantial amount in the ‘90s.

But I digress. We rarely sold the Royal suite as a bedroom, although in extreme cases we sometimes would put a rollaway in there.

So we are working the evening shift, and we only had a handful of departures and arrivals that day, and they were already in, so I was surprised when a fellow approached the desk, said he was checking in, and handed me his confirmation number. Skeptical, I punched in the confirmation number and found that he did, indeed have a reservation, sadly it was for 7 days ago. He’s already been charged as a one night guaranteed no-show, but in those pre-Internet days, you really only saw your credit card statement once a month, so he probably didn’t even know about the charge yet.

I could see in the reservation segment code fields that this reservation had come from a travel agent. Again, those days were pre-Internet, they were only two ways to book a hotel room; through our central reservations number, or through a travel agent. The TA’s had access to our rack system, and could see availability, and could make reservations directly. Those reservations would still need to be vetted by an actual reservation agent and transferred into the system. On this reservation the dates were either transposed (June/July error) or just outright incorrect.

This could have happened at the TA level, or when it was moved over. No way of knowing until Res opened the next day. Either way, here was a fellow standing in front of me, expecting to stay here for over a week, and did not have a room. I had fielded a couple of calls from other hotels that evening inquiring as to whether we had rooms so I knew they were full too. The city was SRO. 

The fellow was understandably upset, although more of the circumstances then at anyone in particular. He was coming from a similar street performers festival in Germany, and had been travelling for two days, he didn’t have much fight left in him. I decided I would give him the Royal Suite, and put a rollaway in it, he was paying our rack rate of $119.00 not the group rate of $69.00 so it seemed fair. The group block was filled, so I couldn’t even offer him that rate.

I told him all about it, and also about the rollaway bed, which he wasn’t too keen on it first, until I reassured him that it was exactly like one of our standard beds, it was just on wheels. It wasn’t like the cot our parents had for company that was 2 inches thick. I reassured him that he would get a good nights sleep. I checked him in, his departure date was 10 days away, and I told him we had occupancy in about three days and I would move him to a normal room type at that time. I sent a note to the FOM to see if we could get the GNS charge either refunded or applied to his current stay.

It was the standard of the hotel at the time that about 10 minutes after check in the switchboard operator would call the room and make sure that everything was satisfactory. The switchboard was right behind the front desk and we could often hear the operators conversations, especially if the door to the back office was propped open which we always did. I heard the operator making a call and addressing the Royal Suite guest, and by the sounds of her responses he absolutely loved the room.

Due to in-house requests housekeeping was backed up and as such it took about a half an hour for them to get to putting the bed in his room. He stopped by the desk about two hours later on his way to the pub, and gushed a little more about how awesome the room was, and how comfortable the bed was. We had a happy guest, and we had a 100% sold out night! Everybody was happy.

Three days later, occupancy fell to the high 90s, but I did have a  few standard kings available, so I called him with the intentions of moving him to a room with a real bed. I offered to have the Bellman come up and assist him in moving to a standard king size room, which coincidentally was on the same floor he was already on, and he could have that room for the duration of his stay. About seven days at that point. 

He said he was happy to stay where he was, the bed was very comfortable, and that hotel room was bigger than his house. He was extremely happy and didn’t want to go anywhere! He said if it was all the same with me, he was perfectly happy to stay exactly where he was for the duration of his stay. I told him I would check, and if the room was not booked for anything else he was welcome to stay there. I put in a quick call to both Sales and to Banquets who would often schedule meetings for that space, but not tell rooms about it, but it was free and clear. I called back to the room, left a message telling the guest that we would not be moving him and to enjoy the rest of his stay. I also told him our front office manager had agreed to apply the GNS charge to his current stay.

All in all, I think this guy made out pretty good, especially for someone showing up for a sold-out city with a week old room reservation! I never heard another word out of him, and he checked out on a shift that I was not on. 

In those pre-Internet days the channels a hotel had for feedback were pretty limited. We had comment cards in the rooms, and that was about it. Occasionally, if someone was very upset they would contact our corporate office in writing, at that time our HO was in England. Even less frequently an extremely happy guest would also contact them. These comments would be forwarded to us via teletype machine, and be part of an about 100 page report that we would download from them every day during the night audit shift. High tech for the time!

So about three months after this guests stay, the flag report shows that he had written corporate to complain bitterly about the substandard conditions he was forced to ‘exist’ in during his time with us. Calling me out by name he singled me out as the villain, who forced him to stay in a room that, horror of horrors, didn’t even have a real bed! And then I made him sleep on a cot, in his words, worse then the bed I had to sleep on at boys camp when I was eight years old. The room was trashy, dirty, outdated, poorly decorated, nothing worked, etc, etc. I made no offer to reduce his rate, and he was overcharged because he was not offered the group rate he qualified for. He was demanding his entire stay be refunded to him.

We reported back the actual facts to corporate, ultimately they denied his claim. I remember it came up at the front office meeting, and we all just shook our heads at the audacity of this guy! We all agreed that we would file it under “no good deed goes unpunished” and try not to let it destroy our collective faith in humanity.Royal Suite Upgrade",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I get to work at Midnight, and at around 12:20 I get a call from one of our rooms.  The Gentleman on the line says that his wife wants to check out.  I tell him that since they've now effectively used the room, I can't refund their room charges, only the deposit.  Policy is that if you're in the room longer than a couple of minutes, you ain't get your money back.  Saves time with all the people that come to to fuck then try to get out of paying and hour later.  


Anyways, guy says he'll tell his wife and hangs up.  About 5 minutes later they come down to the Front Desk, say they want to check out, and that they want their money back.  I tell the lady that's not possible.    


She does not take that well.  


I expected that, but what I didn't expect is what came next.  Her and her husband start fighting, (more her than the husband really, he's relatively calm) he says lets just stay here because I don't want to lose a hundred bucks, she keeps going off about how she doesn't like it hear.  Its not a fancy place, but its clean, I haven't heard any noise complaints, etc.  I'm not sure what her problem with the property is exactly, but she's fuckin' adamant that she does not like it here, to the point where she's both in tears and yelling that.  Meanwhile I put the refund through on our debit machine, and he just stands there staring at it instead of y'know, putting in his card.  The thing times out while he waits and finally turns back to his wife, trying to convince her to stay.  


A cab pulls up for them, and she starts demanding $50 bucks from the Husband if he stays because she paid for the room but wants to leave, claiming she gets him deals all the time???   I'm just flabbergasted at this point.  She leaves the front desk lobby, and he goes after her to talk more.  I hear her say some heinous shit, followed up by ""y'know I love you right?""  


After a bunch of screaming and crying from inside the cab (this poor cabbie) the husband comes back in, and says he'll take the deposit refund.  Of course, now would be the time for the thing to start randomly spouting communication errors, requiring a lengthy reboot, which prompts the wife to come back into the lobby to see why its taking so long.  I explain, she angrily replies with ""what are you, gay?"" (da fuck?)  to which I respond with a diplomatic 'ma'am, that's highly inappropriate, and then get told to fuck off.  


The refund finally goes through and they leave, and I could not add them to the blacklist fast enough.  


The funny thing is, right as he was leaving, the Husband said that he though she was so mad because the nearby bar carded her, and wouldn't let an obviously late 30's early 40's woman drink.Confusing Karen",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Working a 7-3 shift, my day was already going horrible due my horrible co worker screaming at me in front of a lobby of people eating,  because I changed the tv channel to the news, which is policy to have on in the morning , and he felt “triggered” by the news, yeah ok fuck off dude,  ANY WHOOOOOO

I was stocking some coffee cups, and I received a call and it was the guest from 308. He sounded odd. I asked if he was ok, he said, “well I found a bag of urine in the drawer”........wha....what....

I asked what he meant, because he was due out that morning, and how the hell do you not notice a horrible smell like that upon entering the room?!
He said it was a bag of urine and there was more stuff in the room. I asked if it was for sure urine, he said yes, it looks and smells like urine. 
I asked what else he found, he said he found a blue toe nail, a single piece of blonde hair, and there’s lipstick on the toilet. He casually brought up refund and a free night. He wasn’t screaming or anything, just jumped into “I want free”, I told him I don’t get to decide that, only GM and front desk manager do. He started reallllyyyy pushing it. I told him I’ll ask. He also booked through a booking agency and we don’t refund booking agency reservations ever. We don’t charge the actual guest, we charge the agency. 

It didn’t feel right. It felt sketchy. He talked weird, typically if there was an issue like that, I would be screamed at, he wasn’t screaming at me. It didn’t feel right, and it really made me uncomfortable. 

I asked my head housekeeping about this, and her eyes went wide and said bull shit. Apparently, she re checked the room yesterday.  If a room shows vacant on her sheets and it’s a arrival for the night, she’ll go in and re check the room and make sure it’s all set and nothing was forgotten; as well as turn on the low heat for the guests. She said the room was perfect and none of that was in the room when she checked it for his arrival. The woman who cleaned it said that was bull shit as well, and they would remember something like that. Especially, if a bag of urine was found, we consider that a bio hazard. 

I called my GM and informed her about everything, as well as what housekeeping said. She said go into the room, take pictures, look at what he found, take somebody with me to have another witness. She also said he will get no refund, he can have a room move, but no refund. 
I called his room and informed him I need to go up and look at his claims. He said “no that’s not  needed, take my word for it and give me my money back”, I told him none of that will occur until I look at his claims. He sounded very nervous. 

I went up with the maintenance man, we looked around the room; the room is trashed. I just looked at my maintenance man with a straight face and mouthed why, because he is clearly going to get charged an extra cleaning fee! I asked where the bag of urine was, he said, “oh the bag of tea is over here”, he changed it to tea. He said urine. Two very different things. I called him out on the random change of bag substance, and he nervously laughed and said, “no you misheard”, no dude you said urine, I asked you on the phone multiple times if it was for sure urine, you said it smelled like urine and was yellow, like urine. I asked about the lipstick on the toilet. He said it was on the pillow, not the toilet. I called him out on that too, he just laughed and showed me the pillow. So, I like make up, I know what a lipstick smudge on a pillow looks like, the dude took a stick of lipstick and put lines down the pillow with said lipstick. I just stared at him and said well then. I asked about the hair, he showed me it, I picked it up and it was piece of doll hair. I asked about the toe nail. It was a fake nail you get from the store for temporary use, and it was not blue, it was nude. He also informed he stepped on it, that’s how he found it, I asked where he found it. I’m not sure why he was standing behind the couch to look for a fake nail but he did. He also had just gotten out of the shower when we entered the room, there were spots on the big full body mirror in the room. He claimed they were there when he entered the room. I don’t think he expected me and the maintenance man to touch the spots, but his eyes went wide because they weren’t dried marks. They were obviously fresh, it was like he shook the water off his head, and the water from his head landed on the mirror. 

I told him he will be hearing a call from me downstairs after I talk to my GM. He again began demanding a refund. My maintenance man this time told him it’s not for us to decide and we left with pictures of everything he claimed. 
I told the GM I think he was trying to get a free room, and she said he was but failed. The head housekeeper was in the back yelling and cussing, she was pissed. My GM said offer him a room move, no money back, let him know we know he’s lying, and to check the new room before going in case he tries this again. 

I called him and told him we can offer a room move, that’s it, no refund. He said alright, and thanked me, however, I didn’t say I know he was lying, I didn’t want to start conflict. He called me back 5 minutes later on the phone with the agency he booked through , the man from agency said he needs approval of a refund. I asked what the hell is he talking about, and the 308 dude said I would give him one. I told him I never ever said that, and I would never give approval for a refund without a manager approval, and the GM, the woman that runs the property, did not approve of any refund. 

He started yelling about how we’re a disgusting hotel and that he will get his money back, I told him he can take that up with my GM and he is more then welcome to come down to the lobby and get her work card. He yelled he would and would be coming to the desk to give me a piece of his mind and hung up. 

It was about 2 hours later, my housekeeper called and asked if he left or what. He left without giving me a piece of his mind or getting the card for my GM. Head housekeeper said everything he claimed he found in the room was gone, besides the trash he left behind and the lipstick he put on the pillow.Never thought people actually tried to get free rooms",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So this is like super old, but I've just been thinking about it for the last couple weeks because wow was it dramatic.

So, backstory on this is that we had this girl working morning shift (we'll call her Annika because her accent always made me think of Russia despite her not being Russian) that had been hired by our previous FOM right before she finally left the company. She'd been working on getting everything set for her to leave for months, which led her to hiring a bunch of staff that were not great at their jobs by the end because she just didn't care (I think I've got a post on this subreddit somewhere that talks about our auditor who was hired during this time). Annika had claimed to have previous experience working in our brand as a manager (we'll call it Shmilton) and that she knew the operating system.

Events shortly after she was hired seemed to prove otherwise (such as letting someone in without any form of payment because ""well she said it was supposed to be on points, can't we just call?""). At the time, I was working part time as front desk and part time as the weekend am driver (that is 4am to noon) and we were scheduled to have two people on morning shift at all times, plus the driver.

Now, our good friend Annika was not a fan of driving the shuttle, despite it being listed as part of her job. She wasn't really a fan of a lot of things (she wouldn't even acknowledge the housekeepers when they said hi to her), but she was especially not a fan of the shuttle. In fact, one week before the pivotal moment that would cement her future at our company (or lack thereof), she proceeded to get into a screaming fit with the only manager on duty (housekeeping, hilariously) about me going on lunch without checking with her first. Despite there being no shuttles scheduled, a second person on the desk, and my sixth hour fast approaching. Then, when the housekeeping manager told her to suck it up, decided to not do that.

When someone called for a pickup from the airport (about five minutes into my lunch), she decided to call me and have this wonderful exchange.

Annika: We've got someone at the airport.

Me: Cool, I'm on lunch.

Annika: So you're not going to get them?

Me: No. I'm on lunch.

Annika: \*huff\* Fine. \*click\*

When I came back from my lunch, I discovered that not only had she not gotten the guest (who called again to complain about waiting thirty minutes for his ride), but she also lied to the other morning shift agent about having received a call at all.

Oh, and also she was fired a week later for stealing wine from our sales office, getting blazingly drunk on shift, and then driving the shuttle. Fun times.Can I tell you about the worst GSA we've had so far?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So over this entire shift, I've had my confidence in my position shaken by one individual, and a lot of people here. I've been doing some self reflection, and I'm not so sure about what I'm doing anymore. But every time I think about it, it comes down to one thing: I wasn't made for this job.

That's the truth of the matter, I've always been isolated, and to say I'm not empathetic is putting it lightly, I've always been a very cold and distant person, looking through my last posts reveals as much. Interacting with others isn't something I'm good at, whether it be 200 or 2. In fact, I dread whenever someone comes through the door, I hate whenever things go wrong, I can't talk like a normal person, whenever someone has an issue, I'm as relatable as a robot, and whenever I get mad, It's obvious, the facade is transparent, and it's a wonder I made it this far with such a transparently fake face. The pressure of every mistake, coupled with how little I know is weighing down on me. Every shift I fear I'll be scolded for something wrong, and tonight is no exception. This job started out as such an easy job, but it just goes to show that a small hurdle can derail a train. I remember that after I hit the first month mark, I already wanted to leave, I assumed that it was because I didn't like the place I was working in. But I was wrong, the constant fear wasn't from the hotel I worked in, it was because of my pathetic customer service skills, If I was a Fallout character, my charisma stat would be 0. I plan on talking to my boss, I want to know if there's another position I can fill in that doesn't have my interacting with the public.

I remember when I first posted my story here, someone said ""Maybe you're just not cut out for Customer Service"". I hate admitting I'm wrong, but all the people who told me that were just predicting the future. In the end, they were right, I wasn't made for Customer Service jobs, so maybe it's time for a reality check. Thanks everyone for everything. I might return as a person who recounts tales second hand, but I think my time as a Night Auditor is done. I give myself 3 weeks max before I actually leave, unless I somehow manage to convince myself to stay. But I feel like I need to be honest with myself, this job is hell, my sleep schedule is shit, my work ethics are trash, and I'm not good at one of my primary functions.

I guess that's all I had to say, it feels better to get that all off my chest. Thanks for reading if you did.I Think This Might Just Be It",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Not the hotel industry, but I've worked almost every other front desk imaginable. I've been an executive assistant, operations/facilities manager, served my time in retail hell, blah blah blah...worked with attorneys, in mental health, at small family-owned firms, for the state, you name it. A lot of the folks in this sub feel like kindred souls in one regard or another. Generally I am excellent at what I do. I am also a total doof at times and have basically learned to own my mistakes because sometimes, just sometimes, even Karens can understand that you're merely human trying to do your best.

Earlier I responded to a post in r/tifu and thought ya'll might appreciate this. Mobile user, first time poster, hope all goes well.

Years ago I worked front desk at a substance abuse recovery center, aka rehab. Incoming calls were quite emotional to say the least. So-and-so is ready NOW, do you have a bed? It was a private company so no insurance equalled about 24K USD for 30 days. Having to explain that to a person in crisis is shit. Luckily we had a great list of referrals and again, generally, I'm on point in chaos. Empathy went a long way in that job.

One gentleman called trying to set up an appointment for his daughter. I ask his name, he tells me. I ask his daughter's name, he says, ""Lisa, same last name."" I LEGIT SAY, ""Your daughter's name is Lisa Lisa?"" Awkward pause, then me again: ""Well, that was a pretty stupid question, wasn't it?"" He says, ""Yes."" Period. And then laughs. He was about in tears before that so at least my derpness lightened the mood. The conversation went on in a professional but more relaxed way. 

We are people. They are people. Remembering and/or acknowledging this isn't a bad thing.

"I’m the guest service manager for a hotel chain that’s a brand new hotel; 5 months open. 

As a guest service manager I deal with guest issues. That’s easy. 

What isn’t easy is the kids. 
You would expect most parents to continue parenting even while at a hotel but these people think that we are babysitters. 

I got a call from my maintenance manager about kids in the work out area which you need a room key to get into. I went in to find two kids on the treadmills boosting it to the fastest speed. Their parents were nowhere to be found. 

Another kid went up to my beverage market cooler, took both hands and dragged them against the glass of the door. Parents? Nowhere to be found. 

A group of families were in town for a middle school basket ball tournament. They were from my hometown and we kicked it off. Where were their kids? The pool. Splashing and roughhousing. Personally I witnessed two kids trying to drown a third. I told the parents who were getting all liquored up and they acted as if I just killed their buzz. 

3 kids were in the lobby with their parents two feet away from them, kicking a soccer ball around my lobby. I spoke to them and told them not to do that and to take it outside (where there’s less things to break) the parents glared at me like I just spanked their kids. 

I hate kids and the parents who think that just because they are in a hotel means they don’t have to discipline them. 

This is probably why I don’t have any kids. None that I’m aware of anyways. 

Until next time.

"This morning right after breakfast I (breakfast attendant and occasional FDA) was putting in my food order. Our usual weekday agent was off and our general manager was covering the desk.

We are an extended stay Charriott brand that is pet friendly. Many of the hotels in our brand charge a per night pet fee, but we charge a flat rate (the property in a nearby city charges $25/night and we charge $100 flat).

So a woman walks up to the desk to check out. She is overall pleasant and says she enjoyed her stay. Then my manager hands her the bill and she went from 0 to Karen real quick.

GM - General Manager

K - Karen McKarenstein

K: So I have a problem

GM: Oh?

K: I stayed at (same brand in nearby city) and they only charged me $25 for the pet fee, but you charge $100. Why?

GM: So Charriott only requires that we are pet friendly, each hotel's pet fee is decided by their managing company. I know (said hotel) bases their pet fee on a nightly basis but we do a flat fee because it saves more of our guests in the long run.

K: But I was only here for one night. I didn't know it was $100 for just one night.

GM: Yes, and as our website states, as well as the pet policy you signed when you checked in, we have a non-refundable $100 fee.

K: Well then. You need to write down your name, your manager's name, your manager's phone number, and the customer service number because *I* will be taking this up with *THEM*.

Y'all this was the moment we've all been waiting for. Watching a Karen be put in her place so nicely that they can't comprehend how badly they just got owned. No seriously, I need you to read this like you're explaining something to a really cute but kinda dumb little kid. You know the voice I'm talking about.

GM: Well, ma'am, I am the general manager so you'd be taking it up with me no matter what. You signed the pet policy which clearly stated our fee was $100 flat and non-refundable. I see you booked online, which also states that our pet fee is $100 flat and non-refundable. And if you'll see this sign behind the desk, you'll see that it is clearly posted here that our pet fee is $100 flat and non-refundable. This was not a hidden fee and you had plenty of chances to cancel your reservation if you had a problem with it. I would have been happy to waive any cancellation fee for you, even. I cannot, however, refund our pet fee since you agreed to it when you signed the pet policy.

She didn't say anything, she just grabbed her receipt and stormed off. I had to bite my tongue to keep myself from laughing out loud as she did. Karen McKarenstein called to complain about an hour later and asked for the manager. Surprise surprise, my GM reminded her that he was the manager and she hung up.

"Hey guys, just need to rant a bit. 

So I am the FOM for my property. I started here about 9 moths ago. Up util a few weeks ago, everything had been going great. Our area manager basically came in and decided that titles/roles/duties and job descriptions were changing. 

Instead of me JUST overseeing the Front Desk and Breakfast personnel, I'm now assisting with the sales department. Which, to be honest, in this industry, I WANT to go the Sales route. I was excited for this! Yes, it's more work, but it's worth it in the long run! Right? 

Wrong.

Today, I come in to work the 3-11 shift. I'm covering for one of the FDA's who's mother just passed away. Definitely understandable and had no problem covering. I called my AGM, told her what happened and that I would cover the shift. She informed the GM of the situation so we could send flowers as she's one of the BEST FDA's I've ever had working under me in this career. The only problem is, today was supposed to have been one of my sales days. Granted on the ""sales days,"" I follow up with the whole two leads I have right now, train with the sales manager, and then the rest of the day I'm doing my FOM tasks because there's not much else going on in the sales department. My sales manager acted like this was fine and dandy until I actually came in for the shift. 

About 30 minutes into my shift, she's pulling me into the back office because she wants to have a meeting with the GM, AGM, and I. Okay cool. No problem. I prop the door to the front desk open so I can still actively hear/see the front desk, but still be a part of this meeting she wants to have. 

Everything starts off fine. She wants to come up with a new ""process"" for how the front desk handles meeting spaces and groups. Okay cool. She starts going over everything that has been done in the past. I see people coming to check-in so I step back out to the front desk and check-in about 5 people. 

I go back into the back office and all hell is breaking loose. I rounded the corner and my sales manager yells at me and says ***""We didn't need you when we hired you and we sure as hell don't need you now! You don't deserve to work here and you're a piece of trash! I hate sharing MY office with you!""*** 

.... what? 

Please note, that when this shift happened a few weeks ago, she moved into MY office. Not hers. She came in RE-ARRANGED MY DESK AND EVERYTHING ON IT. Because it was not how SHE wanted it. Me, trying to be the bigger person, just brushed it off. Okay whatever. I need to know everything she knows. I'm never in here anyways. Even though it bothered me, I left it alone. 

She then proceeded to say that I ""***could not be trusted with her belongings.""***

""Again .... what?""

She literally sat there for a solid 15 minutes sitting there saying every mean and derogatory thing that she could possibly think of towards myself. My GM kept trying to cut her off and stop her and my AGM just sat there with her jaw on the floor. 

Apparently I've not been doing SOMETHING right. What that is as of this moment, I don't know. I come in, do my job, and go home. I'm a very private person who doesn't let personal and professional instances colliding. I do tend to keep to myself and handle things that need to be handled, but holy hell. What the ff\*\*\*ccckk?

My confidence has literally just been shot into the ground. ""We didn't need you when we hired you and we don't need you now,"" really freaking hurt. I have NEVER done anything to this woman and she literally just went off like I was some piece of dirt on the bottom of her shoe. 

My GM came up to me later and asked if I was okay. I told her that I was so upset that I was ready to walk out and quit. All she said was ""I understand."" and walked off like she did not care at all. 

My AGM relieved me from the desk so I could smoke like 5 cigarettes real quick because some of that going off from the sales manager was directed towards her. She left in tears and I'm not going to lie, I sat there and cried while I smoked.

"I work for our local city at a lot of different buildings, but most are at the front desk as a receptionist. If this isn't the right place for this let me know!

This happened a few days ago but none of us can believe the balls on this guy.

**Background**

At one of the buildings I work at, there are 3 distinctive areas. Area 1 is an auditorium for performances, lectures, movies, etc. Area 2 is a bunch of rooms that are used for classes like the wine and paint nights, or kid classes during the summer. Area 3 is for exhibitions that travel through the area or are from local groups. It can be a little annoying as each area has different costs and they don't cross into other areas, like buying a ticket for a movie doesn't get you into the exhibition (which I have lots of stories of). Our current exhibition is an art exhibition from a local artist. The artwork is composed of items not usually used, clothing, tree branches, candy, etc. It's... interesting.

We do have patrons though who donate to the building and get different perks with the level they are. The top level, Platinum Patrons, donate a minimum of $500 to the building and get lots of perks, like free admission. When I started, I was informed to always be extra nice and bend the rules a bit for the Platinum Patrons. Keep them happy, keep them donating.

**Story**

A gentleman walks in and demands entry. I ask if he happens to be a Patron. He grumbles a bit, giving me his last name to look up in our system. I see he's a Platinum Patron. I give him our normal speech about the art exhibition, as we have to tell people it's a look don't touch exhibit.He asks about photography and I give him our normal answer, yes but no flash. He walks off and I go back to work.

About ten minutes later he comes back to the front asking if we have a step ladder he can use. I had absolutely no idea because I have never been asked this. I told him I didn't but my training about making Platinum Patrons happy, so I called a different staff member and dropped it was Platinum Patron. I let the Patron know we were looking and we would get back to them. He wondered off and the staff member called back and said no to the ladder, city safety wouldn't allow it. When Patron went to leave he asked about the ladder and I told him we didn't have any he could use. He left for the day and I thought nothing of it.

About a week later he was back. I was busy helping other Patrons with tickets to an upcoming film festival but my coworker helped him. I didn't really notice what was going on but he left and came back in dragging something. The patrons in front of me left and my coworker says a Platinum Patron brought in a ladder. We popped over to the security monitor and there he is setting up an 8 foot ladder in the exhibition. I quickly call my boss who started to freak out. She and the two people in charge of the exhibitions come out and are power walking into the exhibition. We sadly don't have sound on our security and the angles of cameras aren't the greatest so we weren't sure what was being said. Roughly twenty minutes later he left with his tail between his legs. I asked the exhibition coordinator what happened and she told me not only did this guy have the balls to bring in his own ladder, he thought it was no problem to redirect the lights for his perfect shot because he wanted to photograph it for his wife as a prank valentines gift because he intended to buy the piece of art for her. Problem was, we can't sell it to him as we don't own it, it's on loan, and the artist is unreachable for a few weeks due to a vacation. When asked why he thought we'd be okay with him bringing in his own ladder he said something like ""You just said I couldn't use one of yours, not that I couldn't bring my own""

"We’ve all heard it. Every complaint. Every smallest perceived slight blown up out of proportion. He saids and She saids. Alternative Facts. I’ve heard them all. 


Tonight I got a whole new kind of complaint. By a friend of a guest who isn’t even staying here. The guest themselves did not complain but their friend call and I had over 10 min of my life wasted with this bitch. 


WTF lady?! You aren’t even here!  You can’t get a discount for her! I kept putting her on hold hoping she’d give up. I head desked so hard.  I can’t with these people. Help.

"Have you guys ever noticed that when you have a hiccup with a guest during check-in, it is very likely that things will continue to spiral out of control from there? I mean, that's not what we -want-. We want to nip it in the bud and let the guest have a nice rest of their stay, But NO. Lady Fate likes to sh\*t on people in threes it seems.

This past Sunday was literal Ragnarok at my hotel. Valentine's weekend combined with multiple hockey teams was not a fun time for any department. We had 87 check outs on Sunday morning (we are a 100 room property) and things just went to hell from there. Not enough housekeepers,  breakfast area WAY over occupancy even though we opened up our meeting room to accommodate the rush, the usual slew of late check out requests, etc.

Well, when I show up to pick up the pieces on Sunday night as the resident Sun-Thur vampire, my FD supervisor looked like she had been through the ringer. Apparently our Exec. Housekeeper had been out of town this weekend so his supervisor was working. And she dropped like, everything? Including all four of our studios.

Queue very important client who is with us for the week and had reserved a studio because they have more room and a wet bar. Said client checked in with my supervisor, all was well before she came back down and calmly stated that somehow she had been given the wrong room type. Supervisor checks log, sees that morning shift had **CHANGED HER ROOM TYPE** to a standard double queen and dropped the studio.

(???)

Supervisor is panicking because she knows who this woman is and all of the studios are dirty. Housekeeping is gone for the day. BUT ALAS. There is a handicap studio that was available. Important client agreed that it would be fine, takes her new keys and goes up. She calls from the room less than five minutes later.

The housekeepers had forgotten to put in the towels and soap for the bathroom and the woman was understandably pissed at this point. My supervisor apologizes and offers to bring up the items. Client declines and says she WILL be moved to a clean, 100% completed room. Supervisor pre-inspects a smaller, but still nice King studio and moves the woman into it. FINALLY, IT'S OVER.

Spoiler alert; it wasn't.

In an effort to nip this chaos storm in the bud, my supervisor made a new dummy reservation to hold the handicapped studio for the important client the following day so that it would not be reserved by someone else. She puts a very concise note in our message system that all we have to do is change the room number and type in the EXISTING reservation and move her the following day. Delete the dummy reservation and call it done.

Well, no. My second shift is uh... not an efficient kind of guy. And that's being kind.

He blows past the notes, doesn't see it (I assume) AND CHECKS HER IN TO THE NEW RESERVATION. Which placed two authorizations on her company card.  The old room was even still checked in when I arrived. My OS has a VOID AUTHORIZATION button (thank god) and I hammered it so hard when I saw what happened. Probably still going to hear about it in the morning, but at this point, someone wants this poor lady shafted by the hotel. Cest la vie.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: To everyone who is going to say that creating a dummy reservation seems like a weird way to hold a room, I'm 98% sure our supervisor doesn't have access to our OS that let's us block rooms or take them out of inventory, so that's how we do it. Could this have been avoided? Oh yah, totally.When it rains, it pours.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A past guest came in at 10PM on a Sunday and his first words were ""I want to talk to the owner."" I informed him that no one else on site but me so I could try and help.

He huffed and puffed and showed me his CC statement with the preauth we did on his CC from last month. I checked his folio and informed him that the hold was released the day he checked out since he paid cash, and that it usually takes some time for it to appear on his statement but he should contact his bank/CC company anyway.

Nope. He got irate and said that we ""caused him problems"" because his wife saw the transaction on their JOINT CC and that he thought we wouldn't charge it because he ticked the option to pay at the hotel. I didn't know what to tell him besides that 1. The hold has already been released so there's quite literally nothing to do here and 2. We reserve the right to put a hold on every reservation's CC as stated in the fine print and that preauth is a very standard procedure pretty much everywhere. He argued some more, and in a bolder move demanded that the reservation be deleted (???) but there was nothing else to be said.

Finally he left but not without telling me to make sure that the owner calls him back and also to make a note in the system that we are not to give out any info lest his wife calls. Like, we're not allowed to do that anyway but DUDE. Talk about shameless???

Anyway it's your fault for cheating lmao. On a joint CC no less. My owner can't help you and neither can the bank. Enjoy your divorce I guess??

"I'll start by saying that I love what I do. I've been in the hotel industry for over 5 years now, I went to college to do this, and I love my job. It's my hopeless co-workers that make me want to leave this hotel. 

I seem to only ever work with two people; the old man that shoved me (morning shifts) and the girl with zero confidence (evening shifts). Today was the cherry on top with her. 

I was on the phone taking a very long call (""can't you do any better on the rate?""), and when I finished she said ""I'm going to clean a two bedroom suite for someone"". Um, why? She said that the man was having surgery tomorrow and ""didn't think he would sleep because of all the street noise"". He wasn't even facing the main street, he was in a room in our small hall facing the side street. 

She also works in Housekeeping--and Breakfast--and offered to clean a room on the quiet side. That already kind of ticked me off because if there isn't another room clean, there isn't another room. But because she's Housekeeping too she knows how to do it, so it's not the end of the world. It's not busy tonight so I'll survive for half an hour without her while she cleans it. 

It took her 2 and a half hours to clean it. 

I sent a message to our FOM to let her know what was going on because I'm livid. When I said it took her that long to clean it she replied ""seriously?"" so at least she's on my side about it. 

This girl also never wears the proper uniform. We're in QA Season so it wouldn't look good if they came in and she's not in uniform. 

My FOM usually makes me Supervisor on Duty when I work with this girl and the other newer people, so I'm supposed to be enforcing the rules. My GM said she's going to be cracking down on uniforms now, and she said if someone isn't in the proper uniform that they'll get sent home. Even though I'm the SOD I can't send her home. 

I won't even go into the mess that was yesterday with this girl and the Trainee, who pissed off Housekeeping on a busy Sunday morning when there was no SOD.

"Years ago, I was a valet at a small Midwestern hotel and casino. (Some of you may remember my previous post involving a claim I drilled a hole in a car. Good times.) Our valet booth opened up to a spacious lobby with the casino to the left, a hotel to the right, and an escalator straight ahead that lead up to two restaurants and a bar.

New year's Eve, 2004 or 2005. The casino rented us all tuxedos; we were expecting two thousand people, but due to inclement weather, we ended up with around 400. Part of the way into the evening this woman comes in - well dressed, the very epitomy of grace and class. She weighed ninety pounds soaking wet, and, with her husband and friends in tow, rode the escalator up to the lounge area.

Time passed. Very few people were leaving due to the party; very few people arriving due to the weather. A few hours go by, and suddenly, a sherrif's deputy pulls up to the door in a cruiser.

A word on our security; we had regular 'check ID' security that could not touch people, and we had agents from the IRGC on site. The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission kept agents there to handle bigger stuff, and these guys didn't fuck around. Well built, plain clothes, former leo or military. They carried cuffs and could make arrests.

At any rate, the deputies come up to the door and waited. A moment later, one of the IRGC agents was  literally carrying the woman down the escalator. She's screaming and yelling and fighting, threatening to sue, saying her rights are being violated - all while being incredibly drunk. They had cut her off upstairs and she got 'flip a damn table' angry. 

As they approached the booth, she somehow manages to wrench herself away from him, turns viciously, and kicks him square in the testicles.

To his great credit, no pain passes over the man's face, despite clearly having received a kick to the jimmies. In what was one of the fastest motions I have ever seen, in an instant she's on the floor and he's cuffing her. He then passed her off to the deputies and they hauled her drunk ass to county.A surprising arrest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"So normally I'm the one who's upbeat and jolly, but tonight I'm beat down and pissed off at my fuckhead of a manager. This is kind of a rant, so buckle up.

A few weeks ago, my boss switched from weekly scheduling to biweekly scheduling. While I thought this was a good idea at first, I'm finding out that this isn't the case. Two weeks ago, tonight was barely a blip on the radar. Tonight, I'm drowning in a pool of check-ins, housekeeping issues, and a lack of staffing.

I walked into my shift to the front office racing around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. Our Slopera system only gave Housekeeping half the rooms they needed to clean (fucking Slopera...), so they were rushing to clean rooms. And remember that little fact of me drowning in check-ins? What had been 28 a couple weeks ago jumped to 96, and I was the only one on shift. And the best part? Of our FDAs, two were out of town on their days off, the guy I was replacing couldn't stay, and my FDM skipped town yesterday out to Demon Louis. So it was just me. Our operations manager couldn't stay, and HK wasn't trained on Front Desk, so I was literally screwed.

Is it weird that I'm thinking my FDM skipped town just to dodge the bullet of dealing with a 96-check in night? Like, I'm betting that's what it was. I was really tempted to send him this: ""Well, thanks for skipping town and leaving me alone with 96 arrivals. Totally not a dick move.""

"So I work in a Schmoliday Ex, just Ex (not a &amp;Suite),as the FOM. So background to my hotel and staff, we earned the top rank award 2018 and missed 2019 over a .2% in just our breakfast score, all other metrics were met or higher. We sit in the top 10 in the Americas. We offer extra amenities to our guest and have a waiver from the brand so we don't flunk an audit. We aim for awards because our management company has incentives to earn bonuses for our high performance.  My staff kill it, our hotel stays like new, and most guests we get love us.

We get a new top shiney member in, he books a standard king, 4 night stay, and checks in normally. I was not present at check in as I was setting up evening reception setting up snacks and drinks(mentioned before extra amenity with waiver). I only assume staff followed checkin script 100% like they always do. 

When I go to the desk to confirm inhouse and arrivals for reception, my staff are speaking to him again, he is upset, and inform him he would need my approval on something. This will be fun because they handle nearly everything in problem resolution, except the worst-of-the-worst Karens. So I ask about what the request is from the guest. 

Top Shiney member this is somehow super important to have only a quality room and demands a suite upgrade. He booked a  standard and was upset he was given the king standard as he booked, because when he walked in we should automatically know to comp upgrade to a two room suite. (After talking with staff this was not requested at any point by during check in, he was informed of room type).

 He is upset not only he isn't acknowledged as Shiney member with automatic upgrade (we offered the amenities options at checkin points or snack, and don't you know he always gets both everywhere else!?!) So he demanded the two room suite from my staff, and they were so unhelpful in agreeing with giving him his two room suite. Our hotel has no two room suite. He argues with 3 year staff because he searched the &amp;suites and we were top of the local listing for &amp;suites. Fact: The reason we were top of the list of all the Scholiday in the area including full service one is because of our score ranking. As a result we are priced higher, we sell out more, and have higher ADR. 

I tell him we have studio suites and list the features, but no two rooms suite. I thought maybe get him in our studio to placate him anyway, but he goes into how he doesn't want to be at some cheap, dirty hotel and room. He wanted to book only a &amp;suites hotel for quality. So, now I'm insulted and mad, but somehow smiling. 

He wants an &amp;suites hotel, and so in his tantrum calls one across town to book a room. They of coarse take the reservation for that night, and  he is believing he is getting a prize going to a &amp;suites hotel that even giving a price that is 40$ less. 

We are top of the local online listing for anything Scholiday because we are better. End of. 97%+ scores while the others sitting at levels that my staff would cry (or at least I would).The hotel he called ranks at  60% scores and below, their BAR is set low to attract anything that stops on the highway, not because your special shiney. 

He gets off the phone and I inform him that we have a 48 hour cancellation policy. His room was in fact type he selected, the hotel was the one he selected, there is no fault to the room or his service, so we can check him out of the room but he is being charged for the first night of his 4 night reservation. He argues this unacceptable. I tell him the policy stands and ask if he wants to just stay tonight and shorten his stay so the remaining nights to stay at the &amp;suites, or cancel it all and I can hand him a receipt for the cancellation before he leaves.

 We go back and forth about his shiney status and is unhappy to hear me say as a shiney member he should understand our policy. I affirm that all of any brand hotels have cancellation policies in place where he would fall under fault. He thinks its okay to switch because they are in the same brand. I tell him no, both properties are franchised and owned by different management and reservations are not transferable especially after check-in. 

He ended up choosing to stay only one night at our hotel (no upgrade, and I am not offering it at this point) and finishing the other three nights in the &amp;suites across town.  He was able to call the other hotel to push back the reservation to next day arrival.  

He goes to collect his two free drinks at the reception from me. He tries to push that I really could have waived the policy for him, he is shiney stays everywhere with no problem, how I was being greedy, and so forth. I said policies are enforced on all levels to be fair to all guests, waiving cancellation fees is not a benefit of any shiney level. He then goes again how he doesn't want a shady or dirty hotel from lower chain hotels. At this I could only smile thinking how much he will enjoy his comp two suite at our lowest ranked Scholiday in the city. Thinking on how much I hope he don't choke on your FREE drinks and FREE snacks that he won't find over there. 

I realize I might sound arrogant about my staff and hotel, but the guy was on that level of insulting and entitled that I can't stand. He never stayed with us before, but entitlement to max level. Checked in like he is a top CEO driving over the road on his company credit card. Acting like a scathing review and complaint to a hotline will make me shake on brand policy. We want to win awards, but leading in fear is not how we do it. We have amazing service and treat our guest well. Our guest reviews will drown all his  noise out.

He left a review as expected with all 1s over our policy. Saying we were ""nothing special"", and told it like his entire checkin was done by me, how I didn't acknowledge him, wasn't rude but too much about money. Really wish we could reply honestly to these things, but defensiveness reads badly on the hotel no matter how wrong they are. 

 Happy to say GM responded supporting the policy, with no reward points given, after all we gave him the room he booked, we were the type of hotel he booked, and we gave the courtesy of canceling the additional nights at no penalty. Ha! 

Wish there was a hotel support line to complain about this kind of shiney member behavior with an alert to hotels to not tolerate or enable it. Have complaint lines go sir this our policy at this hotel and all of our hotels, if another hotel did not follow through on policy properly. Count that as lucky but do not take that as a standard of service. I wish it was in all brands so that the old ""I stay at _____ all the time and I have never ______""   would be taken for the bold face lie that it is.Entitled Shiney Member gets told no",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Now, I don't recall seeing anything about *two* dogs in any reservations. I recall a room with *one* dog in the reservation. I look it up and sure enough, these geniuses lied about how many dogs were in the room. Then they had me come down and clean up a mess they could've fixed in two seconds while not hiding the fact they had two animals. It's $20 per pet, and I saw both of them. So, I let the NA know to add the charge for *two* pets tonight, not one, and updated their reservation to reflect that they have two dogs.

We are the cheapest hotel (price wise) in the area, but it was a weekend and we were in high demand as we don't allow Hockey groups here and there is a weird mid week tourney going on here so all the adults were trying to get quiet rooms.

"Mobile btw.

So to start, I offered to work a double for my boss since we had nobody scheduled for the 3-11PM shift today. I thought it was gonna be me and boss man since we have had every other senior front desk agent leave or put their 2 weeks in... we are down to 3 senior front desk agents (one of which is our full-time auditor) and a bunch of new hires, maybe 4-5! I do 2 days of second shift, and 3 days of night audit for reference and aside from my other auditor who is newer than me, I’m the only one capable of doing audit (my managers don’t know how).

Anyway, I came in at 4PM instead of 3PM after my manager asked what time I wanted to come in (he even said 7PM if I wanted)... well fuck my life because that was the worst time. As soon as I got in, I wasn’t able to count my till or do anything, I went straight to checking people in and answering their questions on top of phone calls for maybe 2 hours (mind you 80 arrivals to make our 150+ room hotel fully booked at 100%. Shoutout to our understaffed housekeeping team for having every room ready by check-in (4PM). You da bes! No hype to construction because we can’t move people around it when we are sold out ;(

I also thankfully had a new hire working the additional pod since we have 2 up here and he was called in to help assist, but it didn’t help at the same time because I had to stop mid check-in or whatever to help answer his questions or calm a guest down after he angered them.

Moving past the huge rush of people and phone calls, it did calm down... but we also serve an evening reception every single day from 5-7PM and that’s when it started up again. The whole lobby was packed, I haven’t seen it like that since summer. Guests hammering the dispensers for utensils and making them spill out onto the floor, using their bare hands instead of the provided utensils to grab chips since we had nachos tonight. The whole 9 yards. Thankfully my manager was still around to help smooth that out.

But then... all hell broke loose. We need more coffee, tea and sugar, hot water, and on top of all those requests (I did have my houseman but he was busy getting more towels for the pool and cleaning if I wasn’t sending him up to rooms for requests) we had guests come and complain about the pool burning their eyes and them coughing (yes, because there was maybe 30-40 of you in there and you weren’t showering before hopping in so the chemical reaction got all stirred up and blah blah - at least that’s what my manager said? I also asked about the levels and he said he asked our pool guy who said they were good. Okay).

So a parent complained, saying it was toxic and could be a lawsuit... yadda. I told him I would contact my manager, but apparently me returning to my pod wasn’t good or fast enough so he asked again if I was going to contact him and do something about it. Yes, give me a minute. I have many things to do. I even had another guest repeat the same thing after I did text my manager, like yes... you aren’t the first one to tell me and be an asshole about it. So I make pools closed signs and sent my little new hire off to put them on the doors (even against my managers advice, because I didn’t want more people to be affected since I was unaware until after that if it was toxic or not). After making everyone leave and letting it calm down for about an hour (and being asked over and over when it would open or why it was closed), I reopened it and allowed kids to stay until 11PM (even though it’s meant to close for kids at 10PM) due to the issue (cue the typical I BOOKED HERE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE POOL card). That made them happy after, at least.

But wait, there’s more! Our back elevator broke down and wasn’t working, my houseman tried to fix it to no avail. I called our maintenance man who tried to explain to our houseman who didn’t get it (a bit of a language barrier), and our maintenance man after that said to just leave it be for now. My houseman didn’t like that and asked if I could call a technician out. I obliged and had them send an overtime technician out to fix it, and he did! In about an hour or so... but no complaints, thankfully. Yeah, that might cost the hotel some and wasn’t approved by a manager, but... I do audit, I see all the numbers, they can afford it :) plus, better done now than Monday or Tuesday when my managers are back in.

To wrap it up, it has been a long day. I did so much. I am exhausted. I’ve been here 8 months and never worked so hard, but I loved it. I loved being so busy and assisting so many people. The amount of happy people outweighs the nasty entitled ones.

I have about 3 hours left of this double, and so far the 11-7AM shift has been a breeze! Let’s hope it stays this way. Back at 11PM tonight :DThe double shift nightmare I wasn’t expecting",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Doing night audit tonight, and some asshole on first shift switched a guest out of a room but didn't note it anywhere... So a family showed up and the room they were assigned to had someone in it!!


We are full so I have to figure out how to ""walk"" a guest. Luckily the night auditor at another brand hotel helped me out... Only thing is... Their rate was 229 a night.... These people had a rate of 95 a night at our hotel.... So my GM is probably gonna be fucking pissed.Walking guests",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tonight's been a slow one so far. The university groups have been in house for a week and I've had no complaints from them, which is a miracle since they always find something to complain about. Outside of a woman literally looking down her nose when I gave her a rate (foreign lady with a heavy air of self-importance), nothing really noticeable has happened, save for one guest who checked in.

This guy came in with a third party reservation and wanted to check in. No problem, just need a card and an ID. I launch into my usual banter with the guest and since he's local, he tells me he wanted to do something special for his fiance since he was working yesterday and didn't have a chance. I blushed since that's the sweetest thing I've heard working at the desk. He takes his keys, goes up to the room and decorates, and the fiance shows up a few minutes later. I had a key waiting for her. After verifying the ID, she goes up. Best thing I've seen in a long time here. Well, at least it was the best thing since those Canadian angels who came through last week.

So there you have it. An uplifting tale on a dark weekend.A Late Valentine",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A guest checked in late, and a late checkout is usually no problem. Not sure how it varies out there but after noon guests get charged by the hour untill check-in time then for an additional day. 

This guy has been staying for a couple of days and normally I do as much as I can for regulars or people staying more than one day. But he is asking for a 1pm check out. I guess I could have just okayed that but I ask the gm first. I'm told by noon for free but after that it'll be an extra $25.
 
This sends him into a tantrum on par with every other asshole that ""stays in hotels all of the time!""
I H A T E when someone tells me they stay in hotels all the time. One GBB told me ""I stay in hotels three hundred and sixty five days a year!"" Do not care...

So yeah, he goes 0 to 60 raising his voice, like thats going to help his cause, to the opposite effect. I tune him out from there as he goes off ""I have four other boys! I travel all the time to take them to hockey tournaments! I'm telling everyone never to stay at this hotel! I'm telling everyone, this is insain! I checked in late so I should be able to check out late!"" On and on, repeating himself. So when he sounds like he's petering off I look back to him smile and say Okay... 

I Wish for every entitled jerk that uses that line, I stay in hotels All of the time I should be intitled to wtf ever, I wish instead of on the inside I could reply go to McDowles tomorrow and tell them you go to fast food restaurants All the time and you want a free burger.I want a late checkout because I checked in late.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Greetings fellow hotel people.  I hope your night is going MUCH better than my night.  It is Valentines Day weekend, so all of the husbands that went out with their wives last night, are now at a hotel with their girlfriends tonight.  On top of that we have the lovely Daytona 500 happening.  Though my hotel is 90+ miles away from it, this event sells out EVERYTHING in central Florida.  I have taken hundreds of calls tonight from people who are desperately looking for a room.  But I had to tell you about the absolute best interaction I've had so far.  For this story I will be M for me and SL will be Stubborn Lady.

Phone rings and I answer it.

M: Thank you for calling My Hotel, this is Imunclebubba how may I help you?

SL: Yes my name is Stubborn Lady and I was wondering if you have any rooms available tonight

M: Unfortunately I am completely sold out tonight.

SL:  Even all of your handicapped rooms

M: Yes ma'am I have no rooms available.

SL: What about your Suites, how much are those tonight.

M: Again ma'am I am completely sold out.

SL: Well fine I'll just stay somewhere else. \*click\*

Alright then,  I thought that was going to be the end of it, then a car pulls up.  On their drive up to the front of my hotel they have gone past my NEON sign that says NO VACANCY, my scrolling LED sign that also says NO VACANCY/NO ROOMS AVAILABLE.  They then read the printer printed signs on my door that say the same thing as the other signs, and the come on in.

SL:  Yes I just talked to you on the phone I think.  I want to book a room.

M: (Bewildered)  Ma'am as I told you on the phone I have nothing available.

SL: Oh I just need any room, even if you have one down for maintenance or any issues at all I don't care

M: Ma'am I have no rooms that are currently unoccupied, every single room has someone in it.

SL: Well I haven't been able to find anything anywhere!

M: I understand that ma'am, pretty much all of Central Florida is sold out right now, due to it being Valentines Day weekend, and the Daytona 500 that is happening tomorrow.

SL: Do you have any suggestions?

M: Your best bet now is to try the mom and pop hotels, one's that you don't find online.  Those might still have some rooms.

SL: Well if I can't find a room can I come and pay you to stay in your lobby?

M: (WTF no?)  Unfortunately I can't allow that due to safety concerns.

SL:  Well thanks for nothing.  I shouldn't have even bothered to come here.

She then proceeds to attempt to slam my lobby door, and spins her tires all the way out of my hotel lot.  Seriously lady I told you I had no rooms over the phone, yet you still came and expected some to magically appear in the 5 minutes it took you to get here?

If any of you are in Central FL tonight, I hope you don't have to deal with too many crazy people, and I hope you don't get tired of saying ""Sorry I'm all sold out""Insanity in Central FL",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Before you read on, the property I work at sits every new person down in a meeting, and discusses what prostitution, drug trafficking, and human trafficking look like in a hotel. If you see any of that or suspect any of it, we are to call either manager and get their opinion. However, if it’s clear as day illegal activity, call the cops, let them know after the cops are called, so they can get on the cameras and monitor the situation. We even have police come in and talk to us about this stuff during work meetings.

Working a 3-11 shift, I noticed a man walking in and out of the hotel. A lot. Cars would drive up to the hotel, he’d go out there quickly, hand them something and then go their separate ways. A woman was staying in the room with him, she kept her head down a lot, she was nice though. The man in the room stopped though, and a random red car came speeding through my parking lot, he ran out and got into the car and they drove off. I didn’t see him for a while. It got to be about 9pm at night, I was finishing up some paperwork, sipping on coffee, and the red car came back speeding. The dude from the room ran in and told me he needs the name reservation changed.

At my property, we don’t mind name changes to reservations, because they usually need it for billing expense reports or they’re part of our awards program and want the points. However, in this instance I told him the name on file has to stay the same, for it is policy, the original name stays. I only said this because he was doing some sketchy stuff all day, I couldn’t figure out what, I had no complaints, so I couldn’t kick them out, GM said I couldn’t either. But, him wanting to change the name on the reservation to his sparked lots of red flags. The reservation name was under the woman’s name who kept her head down the entire time. He got annoyed of course, I kept my foot down and he walked off, luckily I noticed they were checking out the next morning, so I wasn't too worried.

The next day, I pulled up for my 3-11 shift, I see the same man outside with a weird pipe in his hand, walking around my building; he kept trying to get into the building, you have to have a key to enter, also they were checked out of the system, I told my co worker to not extend the stay. I called my co worker who was working that morning and asked if he checked out or not, she said he checked out this morning and there’s 2 other people hiding in the stairwells he’s associated with, and she wasn't sure if she should call the police or not. I noticed him coming around the front to the building to enter through the front, I told her to get off the phone and to watch him.

I walked into the building, and when I walked in the man had apparently dropped the pipe. Whatever was in it was everywhere, and there was broken glass everywhere. He cleaned it up, we swept really good and he disappeared while we had our back turned. I called my GM and told her what has been going on and that there are possibly people in the stairwell hiding. She told me to not call the police, and my co worker and I to go into the stairwell. I grabbed my mace gun and put it in the front pocket of my hoodie, told my co worker to grab the bear mace we had at the front desk and to follow me. We were not happy about this, we just wanted to call the police, but nope boss said no, so of course we found the people that were in the stairwell. Hiding. With all of their belongings. I have never seen these people before though. I just told them I was the night manager on duty, and I nicely told them that this is a form of trespassing, they cannot be in my stairwell hiding, and asked how they even got into the hotel. She told me her friend let her in through the side doors, and she does have a reservation for the night. I informed her, again I am being super nice and calm, that she needs to either sit in the lobby and wait for the room to be ready, or go somewhere else in city to hang out and wait.

She went 0-100, she started screaming at me and telling me I am being mean to her and that she has cancer, and that I have to give her whatever she wants and she can be in the stairwell if she wants. I was not in the mood for any of this. I was being very nice to her, I was calm, my co worker wasn't having it either, however, I guess she could tell my jaw clenched up, because my patience was very thin that day, lack of sleep does that to me. I kept my cool still, I got stern though, I told her she can either go into the lobby and wait or go somewhere in the city to hang out. She screamed she doesn't have a car, I calmly told her I will be seeing her in the lobby then. I waited in the stairwell, told me co worker to go into the lobby and make sure they all go there; we stayed on the phone with each other to confirm.

I got back down to the lobby and I called my GM to let her know what was happening, she said if they give me anymore issues to call the police and kick them out.

I checked them into their room, I put them on the first floor, they asked for a higher floor, I told them that was the only room I had clean at that moment. If there are sketchy people staying in the hotel, we put them on the first or second floor. We can hear the side doors opening and closing. She took the room, within an hour, JUST AN HOUR, there was already foot activity, the woman who was in the hotel the night before, who tried to have the reservation name changed, came in through the side and had random cars driving up and then leaving all day. Exact same activity as the night before. It got to be 8pm, people were calling for that room every 30 minutes, all different people, I had enough. They were clearly dealing drugs out of the room.

I called my GM, told her what's been happening all day, she said call the police, have them with you in the hotel as you kick them out. I called the non emergency number for the police and explained what has been happening for the past two nights, how they were hiding in the stairwell, what was happening with the crazy amount of activity in the room. The police came, I was talking to one of the officers in the lobby, the one who dropped his pipe in the lobby turned the corner, saw the cops, eyes went wide, his face white, and ran out of the hotel. I pretended to not see him, I whispered to the cop what just happened, and he nodded his head and then asked for the register card they signed the day before. I gave it to them, they looked at me with wide eyes, the officer had a smirk on his face of joy. I asked what was the matter, he said he will be right back, he ran outside to his partner, his partner ran in with a phone, they showed me a picture of a wanted woman. It was the same woman who kept having cars drive up for her. I asked what she did, apparently she has been dealing drugs and had gotten into trouble, failed to show up to court, she had a list. And, she was doing that stuff out of my hotel room.

Even though the woman was wanted, the others in the room were not, they ran their names. So, legally, going by what the police said, they cannot force the rest out, I can tell them to leave, and if they refuse after I told them to leave, then they can make them leave. They said they already had a feeling that they will have to do that anyways. So, I called the room to tell them they are being told to leave by the GM. However, the phone was unhooked. I told the cops they unhooked the phone, they said they can stay out of sight as I confront them face to face to get out. So, we went to the room, I knocked, the woman who screamed at me asked what I wanted, and I told her to open the door all the way to please. She did. I calmly told her due to all of the activity in going in and out of the room, phone calls of different people, cars speeding through my parking lot, you letting random people in through the side doors and them leaving never to be seen, as well as unhooking my phone, that they have 30 minutes to get off my property. She said she wasn't leaving. I told her I am adding smoking to the list of reasons she is leaving, it was like a cloud in that room, it smelled of pot, and something else I couldn't put my finger on. She said she wasn't leaving again. I told her if that is the case, then the police can escort her out, so she can either leave in 30 minutes, or in 30 minutes the police can come and get her out.

She said she'll be out in 30 minutes.

They refused to leave after 30 minutes, because the guy who ran out of the hotel told them the police were outside. They were now hiding the wanted woman in the room, police were not leaving till they got her. I literally just wanted them off my property, them getting a wanted woman was their business. Either way, in order for the people to leave, she had to leave. The police asked for every possible way to get out of the hotel, I showed them all side doors, stair wells they can hide in, as well as the window of that room. My hotel faces a major road, the road leads to a major interstate, and there are hotels everywhere in this part of the town, they basically put the hotel on lock down for this woman, and then shut down part of the major road that was in front of the hotel, so she couldn't go anywhere.

The woman who screamed at me came out of the room and asked if she can stay another night. Woman they shut down part of the road, because you were hiding a wanted woman in the room, GET OUT, I told her no and that anybody associated with the woman in the room is band from the property. The police then pulled her aside and asked her questions, she was acting shocked, then yelled, ""I HAVE CANCER YOU CAN'T MAKE ME LEAVE""..........................................I feel for anybody who is sick with anything, but at this point I have guests checking in with police cars and cops all over my building and property, and a road shut down in the front, and you're over here hiding a wanted woman in my hotel room and refusing to leave.

She went back to the room, she started packing her stuff, I am not sure what the police said to her, but she started complying. After 10 minutes, it was dead silent in the hotel, some dude was at my desk telling me about the Super Smash bros tournament going on in town. I was intrigued by this, not gonna lie. However, after a lobby went very silent, and then there was a lot of yelling. Next thing I know, they were bringing her through the lobby in handcuffs. So, that part was over with. The dude at the desk just slowly turned to me and said, ""I used to work in a hotel, tell me EVERYTHING""

As the police were leaving my hotel, somebody came in looking for the woman they just arrested. I just stared at him and told him she isn't here anymore, he asked to go to the room she was in, I said no and that the people in that room have 10 minutes to get out or the police will escort them out; police were still outside making sure the people left. He asked if he can help them get out of the room then to make it go faster. I agreed to it, I walked him to the room and knocked on the door, he did help them get out of the room faster. However, they were in the lobby waiting for a cab, and the whole time he was talking shit about me and then he started hitting on me, he called somebody and told them to find out who called the cops, and that to handle it for him. I flat out told them to get the f*** out, and that I was not going to be threatened at my work. He started cussing and yelling, I just pointed towards the door telling them all to get out. They were finally gone.

Then the hotel across the street called and asked about them, I could still hear the man yelling and threatening me,""THAT RED HEADED BCH IS GONNA GET IT F* HER"" I told them what happened, all I could hear were the other front desk workers there telling them to get out. I called the police and told them about threatening me, they had a officer in my parking lot till 4am. I'm not sure what happened to the dude the ran out of the hotel, but I know they're all banned (edited spelled wrong, thank you top comment for pointing it out for me) from out sister properties.Maybe don't deal drugs out of my hotel room?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I was working by myself 3-11 tonight. Fully booked. 60+ check ins by myself. I was already having a busy night. It took me an hour to eat a salad because people kept walking in to check in. Not all of the reg cards were printed out and I didn’t even have time to do my beginning of shift bucket check. All I had time for was apologizing to people because they booked the wrong room online and they didn’t get the jacuzzi room blah blah blah.... they didn’t have enough towels, they needed more blankets, the remote to the tv wasn’t working, the light is out by the mirror. At about 8:00pm im finally getting around to checking in my CLC guests on the CLC website and here comes Mr Cocky with a $5 bill in his hand. I looked up from my computer and politely asked him what I could do for him in my best faked customer service voice. He said back to me “ what can I do for you to make your night better? “. I told him that that my night was going fine and that I didn’t need anything to make it better. He proceeded to keep asking me the same question 5,000 times while getting the same answer every single time. The he changed it up and asked me what I was going to do when I got off work. I told him I was going home. He asked me what do you have at home and I said my sister. He said well you could just spend the night with me for Valentine’s Day and you won’t have to drive home. ( I live in another town 35 minutes away from the hotel I work at ) I told him that I was ok and I didn’t need to do that. He said oh come on I won’t tell anyone and nobody will know. I looked at him with the most serious smile less face I have and said trust me when I say they will know. ( our owners just installed 12 more cameras around the hotel in addition to what we already have thus tightening our nooses even more snugly ) He said how are they going to know anyways then asked me again. I told him no I can’t do that I’m sorry. Then he leaned forward and said well you know what room I’m in you can just make a key and come down when you clock out so I can make your face smile. I said when I clock out I’m driving home so I can go to sleep I’m very tired. He eventually got tired of me shooting him down and handed me the $5 bill in his hand and asked for change. I opened my drawer and gave him five $1 bills and told him to have a good night. He walked away &amp; I was never happier to see a guest walk away from my desk tonight ever. It happens way toooo often and I don’t know what they think I am going to say like “ sure sir I’ll be down to your room as soon as I clock out so I can get fired for being unprofessional and sleeping with a guest. Because I don’t really need this job or my paycheck or anything, I’m just working to kill the extra time I have in life because I’m secretly rich ya know, plus that would be an excellent job reference for the future. So thank you so much sir I’ll be right there.” Smdh 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️When will people learn that FDAs are paid to do a job at a hotel &amp; not to sleep with the guests ?!?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"When the 2 highest tier rewards members check into the hotel they get the option to pick out a snack and a drink or bonus points instead. We also have a suite shop with other products to purchase. 

I was doing a 2-10 shift and from 6-10 I was by myself. At around 8pm a man walks in and I asked if he was checking in. He replied back to me in a rude way saying,”you think”. My eyes opened up wide because I already know this guy is going to be a bigger problem than he already is because of how rude he responded back and his snowflake status and I better be careful and stick to the script because I feel like management is going have to get involve. 

Snowball was looking at our smilton sounders snack and drink options and he asked if we only had spring water to give out to reward members like him. I said yes and he shot back right away and said, “I hate spring water.” I apologized and said that’s just what we carry. He then asked for a sprite instead and I said we only complimentary give out the spring water and the 2 coke products, Diet Coke and regular coke. 

He looked at me and said he was disappointed because he is a snowflake member. I apologized again and in my head I already feel like he’s going to use that to bully me. Oh boy was I right. 

He said sprite and Dasani are coke products and he should be getting those instead because he is a snow flake status member. I looked at him and said I’m sorry but I can’t do that. 

He then left the front desk to go around the corner to go to the suite shop and pulled out 2 Dasani waters and said he’ll be taking these instead of the spring water. I apologized again and said sorry I can’t do that. He mention his status again and said,”tell your manager that I’m a snowflake member and I want these instead of the spring water or do I have to.” I apologize again and say I’m just following policy.

I text my manager about the situation and I guess she didn’t want to deal with the headache since high tier status and so she told me to just give it to him and put it in the pass down log and write it off on the waste sheet. I got so annoyed because just 2 weeks ago I had a 2 hour stand off because a guest wanted 3 weeks of free parking and I wouldn’t budge in and today I had to give in to a different guest because a high tier member status bullied the front desk agent without a fight from management or me. Following script I thanked him for being a snowflake status member and felt a part of my soul die after he left to his room. 

I always ask my gm for advice on what to do during different runs in with guest issues when he’s available in person and he told me,” I would have told you to keep following the policy but You did the right thing asking the manager of the front desk department and getting approval from her instead of taking things into your own hands.”Dasani and sprite are coke products.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"First

At our hotel we have valet parking and valet parking only. You now must pay $X dollars for (been 2 years since we started making people pay) it and it is the cheapest price of all our downtown hotels. It’s labeled on our website and all the other 3rd party sites too. 

Last week I saw there was a car in our small lot. When I checked our logs it said no cars in our lot. I put on a violation tag on their windscreen. It was snowing so like a good night auditor I was shoveling. It’s early morning and still there. So I’m fairly sure it is a guest and our dumb ass valet didn’t post the charge to the right room.  Or at all. It starts and since there are no footprints I realize the guest will be down soon. 

I book it back to the front desk and wait. Sure enough a couple comes down. I ask them if that is their car and I say I’m sorry but there is an X amount parking charge. 


The guest looses it. He goes off one me saying he didn’t valet park so that means it is free!  It says free on our website!  How dare I do this!  We’re going to the hospital!  


Yeah. No. I offered to show him our website and says no he is in a hurry and storm out. He was trying to play the semantics card. Valet parking vs we don’t say anything about other parking options. Whatever. I post the charge and hand him receipt when he comes back to pick up his spouse. I expect he will call and complain but whatever. I’m more pissed at our valet and our guest is lucky we don’t tow. 


Second 


Guest calls for his car and when he comes down he asked did we heat it up for him?  I was a bit flabbergasted. He wanted me to leave his car either unlocked, running with the keys in the ignition OR locked with the keys in the ignition?  Either way stupid and he’ll be very late one way or another.

"I work in a very bare bones property. We have beautiful rooms wirh full fridges and stoves and sinks, and a beautiful hotel in general. But we cater to long term and business travelers. We don't have a pool, hot tub, restaurant, or bar. And we still sell out on Valentines Day easily in our city. Our city has a great romantic downtown.

Guy: Yes, I need a king suite with a jacuzzi in the room please.


Me: sorry sir, we don't have suites or jacuzzis here. Also, we're sold out for the holiday except for standard rooms with double beds.


Guy: I need an in room jacuzzi, I can do with a queen.


Me: Sir we don't have any in room jacuzzi's here. 


Guy: well, I just don't understand. Why does NO ONE around here have suites or jacuzzis? What kind of area is this? 


Me: Is there anything else I can help you with?


Guy: Yes, you know the area. I need you to book me a room with a jacuzzi somewhere near downtown. King preferred but-


Me: Sir, I don't know of any hotels in our area with jacuzzis in the room, and i can't book a room at another hotel for you. I'm sorry.

"I work at a Maliott hotel. My roommate booked a room for the weekend in the city with his girlfriend for Valentines at a Maliott property and just got an email saying he's been relocated to a place 20 minutes from where he was supposed to be. He came knocking on my door, asking me to explain (I don't work at the place he's staying at, he just knows I'll have knowledge of the situation).

And I tell him exactly what happened; Maliott doesn't give a shit whether or not he has a room at that property, as long as it sells out. They oversold the rooms on purpose for the sake of getting to 100% and didn't care how it impacted the guests who were willing and ready to pay to stay there. He was furious. He asked me what he could do and i told him the truth; absolutely fuck-all. I told him he could try calling but it likely wouldn't help much because they've probably already evaluated all the arrivals for today and decided who is the best (least problematic) people to walk.

He calls them, yelling (and rightfully so). He has every right to be upset, even I as someone who has had to walk countless people can admit that. After talking with the manager, he was offered a double bed room instead of the suite they had booked. Clearly he wasn't ok with that. He then finds out the place they were walking him to was a MASSIVE downgrade in quality so he just cancels the room. Now they're on their way to the city, frantically finding something that will work for them.

This is what the asshats at corporate don't see; the stress and frustration overselling intentionally puts on their guests. Obviously, we FDA's see it all the time (if you're unfortunate enough to work for a chain that employs this ""sales strategy""). I never judge someone or get frustrated when they're yelling at me for being walked. Its entirely avoidable bullshit and should be illegal. What a joke of a ""sales strategy"". But the people at corporate are cowards and shield themselves from the truth of it. I once got a write up for telling an irate guest the ""sales strategy"" and directing them to file a corporate complaint. Corporate wants their cake and to eat it too.

"Setting the scene: it's a ridiculously busy day. We have over 130 check-ins, shuttle rides galore, down a kitchen staff member etc. And of course the phone is ringing non stop. I had a line of 3 people so I had to put all calls on hold. One guy calls, I put him on hold, and this is our brief conversation once I finish with the line.

P: *sighs* Did you not hear me? What is the rate with my discount?

Me: Well, it is late and there was a bit of a wait, I can do it for $149 tonight.

P: You make me wait over 10 minutes and then only give me $10 off? NO! I want it for $100 tonight, including taxes and fees.

Me: Sir, I have a duty to the guests standing in the lobby just as I have a duty to you. I apologize if the wait was unexpected but I can't take $60 off because you had to wait a few minutes. Would you like to book it for $149 plus tax?

P: Of course not! I just said I want it for $100. Your customer service is just awful. Are you really going to turn my business away?

Me: Sir, I'm not turning your business away, I'm offering the room already at a discounted rate. If you dont... *he hangs up the phone*

What. The. Hell. Selfish, entitled douche. Its 2020. If you're really in THAT big of a hurry, just book on line. That is so much easier than on the phone and you can get access to literally every bit of information you could possibly need. 

Also, how incredibly frustrating is it when you're noticeably swamped and you still get people crowding the lobby just to ask stupid questions? Like after I'm done checking someone in, they want to have a whole conversation about local restaurants when there's a whole line of people behind them. Or when people stand in line just to ask where the bathroom is, when we have signs post all around the lobby. Or when people come through, cut in front of the line, just to ask for directions to somewhere when they have their iPhone 10 in their hand.Guest wants $60 off the room because he had to be put on hold for a couple minutes",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"There's a sweet older woman here who is always smiling and brings such positivity to the building. Despite being in her late 60's, she goes to 2 cardio classes a day and is always learning a new language. I'm tri-lingualish so I know from conversation that she isn't just a dilletante, she really learns the languages she studies. Anyway, she's a delight. 

To the crux of the post, she bakes cookies every holiday to put on the front desk and puts a little card to wish us all a happy whatever's day. Today of course, it was for Valentine's Day. Even the single, bitter people smile and appear lifted up by the gesture. 

Well the plate of heart-shaped, pink-sprinkled shortbreads was empty by mid-afternoon and my boss grabbed the card, crumpled it and tossed it in the trash. 

I didn't think much of it until she came home and wanted to put more cookies on the plate. When she asked where the card went, I had to tell her it got thrown away. 

I explained later that everyone really loved the cookies and what had happened but I felt bad because I could tell it hurt her feelings a smidgen. It seems like a sin to darken the day of such a joyful person, to make them feel unappreciated. 

Well being the go-go gadget type that she is, she came back down with a newly printed card and a smile. ""Let me know when the plate is empty again and I'll bring down more cookies."" True to form.

"Years ago, in the 90’s, I did a short stint at a theme roomed hotel attached to the, at that time, world’s largest shopping mall. We had 5 themed room types, the Truck Room, had a 57 Chevy with bed in the back, traffic lights and road signs all over. There was a Roman Room with a round bed and statues making up the decor. There were a couple other types as well. The rooms themselves were quite small, but commanded top dollar and was a destination hotel, plus it was built-in to a 5.2 million square foo5 shopping mall/water park/amusement park.

As you might imagine it was very busy on long weekends and special occasions. Christmas was an exceptionally busy time, but like most hotels, business dropped off in the New Year so when February 14th approached the hotel pulled out all the stops in advertising for the big occasion. This year the 14th was a Friday and the Monday a Statutory holiday so they were packaging it as a 3 night stay, with romantic dinners, breakfasts in bed, rose petals in the bathtub etc, etc.

The hotel and the shopping mall were simply smothered in advertising hawking the Romantic Weekend! The ownership group that owned both the shopping mall and the hotel were known to be notoriously cheap. They had given the entire print campaign to a new, untried company that offered a steep discount. The print campaign included banners, flyers, posters, inserts, tent cards etc, etc. When the materials arrived in early January,the banquet department was tasked with distributing all of the content. 

A battalion of Pilipino ladies slathered all public spaces with posters. You couldn’t swing a dead cat in that hotel without hitting a poster.

I was the shift FOS the evening after the posters went up and I was in an elevator going to do my room inspections. All FO managers had to inspect 25 rooms a week and submit maintenance requests and housekeeping reports. I was alone in a guest elevator and glanced over at the promotion poster, it looked odd but then the doors opened and I stepped into the hallway. In the hallway was another poster and I examined it at length. Something wasn’t right, but couldn’t put my finger on it.

I was sitting in the back office when it hit me, I went out to the desk and looked at a poster we had behind the agents. Valentine’s was misspelled Vanlentine’s, with an extra ‘n’. There were 10 pallets stacked with boxes and boxes of the various print materials and on every product every instance of Valentine was spelled Vanlentine!

I think that when you look at the sign printed in big red letters, with hearts, and Cupid shooting bows and arrows, your brain just automatically recognizes the word, without you actually reading it. That is why it took me a while to figure out the spelling errors.

I took down all of the materials that were on display around the front desk. I sent an email to the director of sales pointing out the error. The next day I was on my two days off, and I assumed it would be handled by my return. When I got to the hotel after my days off I was surprised to see the same sign up outside of the staff door, but I assumed they just forgot to take that one down, so I peeled it off the wall and brought it inside with me.

I was very surprised upon getting into the hotel that all of the signs, still containing the miss spell term, we’re still up everywhere. When I checked my work email, I did not have that email at home in those days as email was very new, I had a message from the DOS telling me they were just going to run with it. It would be too costly to re-create everything, and they didn’t think it could be done in time. 

Someone, somewhere along the line, had signed off on the proofs that were sent to them by the printing company. So when they initially contacted the printing company to tell them about the error, the company said, tough shit you approved the proofs. English was not the first language of the printing company owner, really it was like more his fifth or sixth language. 

I personally thought, it was a joke for a hotel of this calibre to continue to use that material, but ultimately we only received about half a dozen reports over the entire time the content was up!Vanlentines Weekend",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"The policy here with any of the guests’ story is to believe it firstly, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. 

So here’s this ridiculous story: 

In the afternoon, I had offered to help the guest while standing in front of the counter since I was about to run and do some hotel errands.

I say to the guest: “Hello sir, how can I help you?”

The guest says, “No, not you. Her.”

I’m not in uniform because managers don’t have a uniform. We just dress in smart casual. I just happen to have forgotten my name tag.

The intern behind the counter is struggling to help him, I ask him, “what’s your room number sir?” In my best customer service voice ever, and he stares at me blankly, I ask the same question 3 times and the intern asks the same question, which he finally replied “509.” He was returning a motorcycle and the intern’s lack of English was making this hard for communication. 

And then I was like “sir I work here... I am trying to help you.” 

He says “prove it.” 

Me: Why do you need proof that I work here? 
(At this point I honestly started to get frustrated) I am clearly trying to help you all this time and you haven’t made my life or your life easier. I’m the assistant manager, I just forgot my name tag.

He: I don’t believe you.

Me: Oh for goodness sake sir, what is your problem? I am literally trying to help make your stay easier and you’re just plain out refusing for no valid reason.

I go into the back office without obstruction, and I bring out my manager and just as the guy is walking, I say “I’ve never met a guest who refused help like this.”

He turned back and said “yeah”

So I decided to prove myself to him and gave him a free dinner. Caveat: drinks weren’t included. I made this clear by not writing that drinks were included. (Text said “I would like you to indulge in a free Valentine’s Day dinner.” No mention of free drinks anywhere)

I sent him the dinner voucher with an apology letter signed by the GM. The GM will back up my ass whatever I do. 

Our side of the story:

He thought drinks were included at dinner, ordered two red wines and then got surprised when he received a bill. The family walked out and was chased at the door of the restaurant and he waved the letter that stated the contrary (implying that drinks WEREN’T included) and the wife paid for the drinks in cash. I asked the F&amp;B manager why they just didn’t bill it to his room. He described them walking out without paying the bill. I trust my F&amp;B manager. He’s been with us for 12 years. All the restaurant staff backed up his claim. I only found out after this happened:

His side of the story (Mostly bullshit):
He was chased TO HIS ROOM by a waitress saying he hadn’t paid yet or signed the cheque to allow his room to be charged for the wine, and he says that his wife was pressured to pay and “IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO BE CHASED DOWN LIKE THIS.” He came to the reception and I just did my usual poker face and adhered to his request. I did confirm with F&amp;B manager that his wife had indeed paid cash, and he only had a bill for the previous night’s dinners.

Honestly I just wanted to post this because I am so frustrated about how he came up and ruined my colleagues’ day and mine. For pretty much no reason other than to maybe get some “compensation for the bad behaviour”

If he ever goes on the OTA website review and complains about this I will post my response to r/quityourbullshitGuest makes up fake bullshit story... tries to get some form of compensation, but thankfully I didn’t give him any.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"My hotel is a smallish lower tier Schmilton hotel in a small town in Florida. It happens to be Valentines weekend this weekend. It also happens to be the weekend of one of the largest car racing events in Florida, probably in the USA, and from what I understand is on quite a few lists as one of the biggest in the world. My hotel happens to be a short drive to said large car racing event. Not close enough that we're in the thick of it, but close enough that when everything in that area sells out people go for us. We've been sold out for basically a month for this busy weekend.And yet 

I have gotten SO many calls today from people looking to book for this weekend and them being frustrated when I tell them that we are sold out. They all go ""What's happening that you're so sold out? Everywhere is sold out? WHY?!"" Gee...I wonder? When I remind them of the holiday AND the racing event they all seem dumbfounded? As though this information should not affect them being able to get a room. ""Well I'm not here for the races!"" Good for you, still no availability. ""I'm here on business, not for Valentines day"" Hope business is good, still no rooms available!

One of my favorite things they'll say is ""Well I didn't know about any of that....isn't there anything you can do?"" ...no? How is you not knowing about these events going to change that all the rooms have already been booked by people who DID know about the events? They'll really push it though, as though we're lying to them about there being no rooms. Who's best interests this type of behavior would serve is a mystery to me.

But the real kicker was a woman who complained to me that we were being ""discriminatory to locals"" upon being told we were sold out. When I asked her what she meant she said ""You gave all the rooms to people from out of town and out of state just because you wanted to make money off of the races! You didn't save any rooms for the locals who actually need them just because you knew you could sell them all to the race fans for a higher price!"" Why do people think hotels need to put rooms on reserve for the wildest of reasons? No, we don't save a few select rooms for locals on the off chance one of them will need it when there happens to be a major event in town. Sorry?You not knowing, or caring, about a major event in town doesn't change that we're sold out",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I am working the 3-11 and sometimes we charge the credit cards for non refundable bookings on the day of arrival if we didn't notice the booking was an advanced purchase when it was made. 

Anyway, some lady called saying the wife of the person who was supposed to stay died and they wanna cancel the reservation and get a refund.

I calmly explain our policy fully expecting them to insist on getting a refund. But they just say ok fair enough and put the phone down.

If they had insisted and explained what happened I might have agreed to a free cancellation but I was just surprised when they put the phone down.

Now I feel very bad and like they must think I'm heartless and they will go online and leave a bad review saying we didn't cancel their room even if the person died.

The thing is, I have heard every reason under the sun as to why someone wants a refund on a non refundable rate, and my go to response is always to say that our policy is what it is.

"So,, it's cold here today. Temperature is in the low single digits with a few degrees - in the ""feels like""

Lady comes down to get a new key and to go out and smoke. Great,, don't care yet.

20 Min after this encounter I watch on the camera as she ventures her way down to the pool door. Now, I've bitched before that our pool closes at 11, but in reality the lock is functional 24/7. Usually I just reprogram the lock and change in back in the morning so I don't have to deal with it. I'm filling the pool tonight so I have not bothered to redo the lock.

Anyway, it's late and most of the lights in that area are off so it's dark enough that I see the unmistakable flash from a lighter.

Yep,, bitch is smoking in my pool room. I head down there and took her by surprise, she was crouched up along the wall under the camera just smoking away. I tell her she cannot do that in any public area of the hotel. She asks 'Well, where am I supposed to smoke then? I'm like ""well... You can smoke outside.. but there is not an indoor option.""

She looks at me like I just called her something bad looks straight at me and asks where outside is.

I could not really contain the wtf of it so I told her that she was welcome to use the big doors she went out of on her 1st smoke break, or the other 2 doors that she passed to get to the pool area. 

I walked her to the closest exit and she asked like 3 more times if that was outside. 

She seemed so normal at our first interaction so now I'm just confused.Well where is outside?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"I work in a busy 400+ room Warriott hotel and convention center in the center square of a small US city.  

This weekend alone we have room blocks for 3 sports events happening in town, and a hunting convention and a dance competition with thousands of competitors happening in house—and of course as all of us on this thread are dealing with, the Valentine’s crowd. We are full to oversold for the next few days.

Tonight was the calm before what I am anticipating will be a pretty wild storm, and maybe it’s because of  that that this reservations mess up had me cracking up so much. 

So a lady and her teenage son walk in to check in for the next few days. I start with my normal spiel and ask  her last name. Nope. Not in the system. Is there another name it could be under? She gives me her company name. Nope. She gives me the name of the event organizer that booked it. Nope. 

She asks if maybe it was booked for tomorrow instead of today. Nope, not showing any res in the system under that name for any day. 

Manager and I start going over all the names in the system for tonight hoping that maybe they just botched the spelling. Thankfully she has a less than common first name, and finally we find a res with her first name. The last name on the res is CHILD. We ask if there is any reason that it could have been booked under that name.  “Well...”, she says, “I did tell them that it would be me and my child in the room.”

"WARNING: one aspect of this tale is disturbing, very disturbing. Please be aware. I am not sure what happened to this horrible excuse of a person. 

DISCLAIMER 1: I do not work housekeeping, I am not fully aware of how their policies work, I do know at my hotel property, that we HAVE to go into the room after three days, I was not aware we have not been in the room for over 3 days, I did not know any of this was going on, I mainly work 3-11 shifts, morning shifts are rate for me. The housekeepers tended to the room have all gotten write ups or have been fired from their job after this incident. 

DISCLAIMER 2: My GM does what she wishes, she has been the GM of the property since she was 22, she is in her 30s now, whatever she wants goes, I do as she says, not blindly, but with this instance I let her handle it for it was a.....disturbing situation. 

Any question you may have, I probably do not know, almost all questions have not been answered to this day. 

The man from 301 seemed like a chill dude, he wasn't all up there, but he was nice and respected us. He didn't ask for anything for the two whole weeks he was here. He was from out of state, he would Uber all the time, came in not wearing shoes a lot; I didn't question it, he wasn't hurting anybody. Well, he kept extending his stay with the same person over and over again, that person wasn't authorizing the credit card, which is something we have to do at my property, it ensures we will get payment and there is money on the card. Nobody did that. So, after two weeks, I come into work and my co worker told me his card declined, he owed us about 1,500 bucks. So, I called his room and told him I need payment, he hung up on me. I informed my GM and manager, they told me to deactivate his room keys, which will make him have to come to the front desk and talk us. So, I did just that. He came down for breakfast, he tried to go back up to his room, key card did not work, he came to the desk. My GM handled it from there, since it was such a large amount of money owed to us. She informed him, that he is not allowed back into the room until we get payment for the entire stay, two whole weeks of room payment. Again, GM said that, not me. He sat back down in the lobby, he somehow got the full payment of the room. He paid us the amount owed, asked to extend, we extended it for one more night, authorized the amount for one nights worth, all good to go. He left for the day. 

The head housekeeper came to me and told me the room was a wreck. I asked what she meant by, ""a wreck"", she said his do not disturb sign has been on the door for two weeks, the housekeepers who tended to the 3rd floor either didn't tell her he had the sign on or said they gave him service. So, they lied because they didn't want to deal with. It is our policy that we have to go into the room after three days, you do not have to have service, but we just want to make sure the room isn't destroyed. I informed my GM of this, she sighed and called the man in 301 and informed him of the policy and that it has been well over three days, and after the incident with payment this morning she is going into the room. He told her she couldn't go into the room. She said alright, hung up and called our regional manager on this issue, he said to go into the room and make sure no property has been ruined. 

My maintenance man, my head housekeeper and my GM all went into the room. What they found has given me a lot of unanswered questions, the clean up of this room cost more then the 1 man 10 cop throw down. In the room was massive bundles of rope. Rope you'd buy at home depot if you wanted to make tire swings in your yard. As well as a box of electrical tape, clothes everywhere, drug needles everywhere, we had to watch where we stepped, there were shirts covered in blood, towels covered in pee and feces, large amounts of ham. No bread. Just ham. The mini fridge was full of ham. Nothing to go with it, just ham. In the bathroom, the tub was full of hotel sheets, on the bathroom counter laid the biggest butt plug I have ever seen. 

They left the room and my GM called the man from that room and told him he has exactly one hour to get back to the hotel, get his belongings and leave, and that she will be charging him more for everything that had happened to that room. She also said if he is not back in an hour, the police will be here waiting for him to escort him to the room and have him take his things. Since drug needles were found, we were not sure if he would go crazy from this or not, so she wanted the police here just in case. An hour had passed, he had not come. She gave him an extra 30 minutes, he did end up calling and telling her he is on his way, she told him she is calling the police on him to have him escorted to his room to get his belongings and out of the building. He said alright and hung up. He never came. At this point, my GM considered him trespassing and the destruction of property lead to the police being called and her allowing them to fully search the room. It just got even more disturbing. 

Upon them searching the room, they had discovered tubes wrapped in hotel sheets, the tubes were used to insert into yourself and flush anything out of your system. As well as bags upon bags of pee you apparently rubbed yourself with for sexual reasons. There were dildos being found wrapped in shirts; they were either covered in blood, feces, or both. They found more robe, they found drugs and needles, as well as children clothing belonging to a young girl. There was never a girl with him that we were aware of, we never saw a girl with him, we only saw him. The police ended up running his name in the system after finding the clothing, and turns out he had multiple warrants for his arrest in Florida. They didn't say what, he was just wanted in Florida. We gave descriptions of him to the police, they asked for any information regarding him. I had an idea of what he was wanted for at that point based off how they were acting. They parked their cards across the street waiting for him to return, he never did.

We hired a cleaning crew to clean the room, there was no way housekeeping was going in there. The cleaning people had to throw away everything in the room; they did fill a small box of his belongings that wasn't covered in feces or blood. All clothing in the room had to be thrown out. Our policy is we have to keep guest found belongings for 90 days. Regional manager said throw it out, we aren't having a bio hazard in the hotel for 90 days, keep what isn't a bio hazard for him. The small box of his belongings sat in my GMs office for a month. 301 dude had his friend come up here and pick it up for him.

"I have a good friend who I learned is being abused by her girlfriend. I and another friend are going to where she lives this weekend to get her packed and moved out. Today I asked where she was going to move to, and she had no idea and suggested maybe we put off moving her.

Which is not going to happen. She’s not being physically abused, but her girlfriend is threatening suicide, threatening to hurt my friend’s pets and burn her belongings. She cannot stay there longer.

So I was calling around extended stay hotels, and I found one that wasn’t too ridiculous. The gentleman I was talking to asked what was bringing me to town for two weeks, and I explained. 

He immediately dropped the rate as low as he could. He explained their security to me. He explained that he’s the general manager, and then gave me his personal cell number “just in case”. I’m not sure exactly what that means, and I don’t think he really did either, but I am so grateful for him. To have this complete stranger just instantly be on our side, to have his support and his help, it was just amazing.

"Well, barely a bite into my first taco, and I've already got drama to deal with. Yay.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of that most awkward of conversations one can have with a guest. No, not 'please put some pants on', the other one.

Everyone is checked in, no issues beyond the usual, looks to be a good shift. Which of course means something has to go wrong. Sure enough, someone comes to the front desk.

He is holding a wad of tissue.

Some of you know *exactly* what that means; don't spoil it for the rest. I most certainly know, but I can hope... and play dumb.

""Hello, how may I help you tonight?""

""Uh, yeah, we found this in our room...""

He unfolds the tissue, revealing what may be the biggest bedbug I've ever seen. Big healthy bastard. Well, formerly healthy, anyway.

""...is it a bedbug? My girlfriend is kinda freaking out right now.""

I groan inwardly. Policy is to *never* admit that such horrible beasts might *ever* come into our hotel. This is of course a vain hope.

For those non-hotel folks reading this sub, you should know that bedbug infestations have become a major problem for hotels, worldwide. Where before they were the domain of the zero-star flophouses with hourly rates, now *everybody* is getting them. Even the luxury five star places are getting them. Show me a hotel that says they've *never* had bedbugs, and I'll either show you a lying liar who lies, or a hotel that's been open less than a year

They've become increasingly hard to get rid of - what used to be just a spritz around the bed once a week now takes intense treatments, using nastier chemicals. Wanna know the best way to kill an infestation? Heat the room to 125°F (52°C) for a *week*. And hope.

But I digress. The issue at hand is I have in front of me what is very clearly a dead bedbug, that I'm not allowed to talk about.

""Hmm... It looks like it *might* be..?"" I offer lamely, ""Not really sure... It might be a small roach, or something else... Just in case, though, let's get you a different room."" 

Ugh, I felt *horrible* having to say that.

Keys are made, the offending corpse discarded, and the manager's card is given. It's a third-party prepaid, so a refund will be tricky, but we generally try to make good on these incidents.

My hope is that since this is a big one, that it's alone, having come from the previous guest. A tiny just-hatched one would mean an infestation.

Anyways, there you have it. Our hotel has cooties, and I have to lie about it. Not my proudest moment. I mean really, what can you say? 

Thankfully, our exterminators are really good. Did you know they have bedbug-sniffing dogs, now?

"A middle-aged lady comes in. “Do I get a discount? I’m a close friend of the owner....” I wait to see where she’s going. “Umm, I can’t remember his name.” Since she can’t remember her close friend’s name, I give her the rack rate. 

Next thing I know, she’s walking into our personal laundry room. She walks out with some goo gone. “What are you doing?!,” I say. She responds, “oh, it’s ok. I’m friends with the owner.” I tell her, “no. Don’t go in there. If you need something, ask me.” Of course, she does—all night. 

The next morning, I tell the owner that his good friend checked in. He tells me, “yeah, she use to work at the post office. I guess I was too friendly when I dropped the mail off, so now she thinks we are best friends.” 

The next night, she returns. She’s visibly flustered. I’m waiting for her to try to get a discount. She reaches in her purse. “My wallet is gone...” *Oh no*,I think. *She’s going for a free room this time.*

She begins checking in. I scan her card and it comes back declined. “Oh, it’s ok, I’ll just go to the hospital and stay there tonight.” She takes out her cell phone and dials 911 for a third time. “I’m not feeling well. Yes. I need an ambulance.” A few moments later, the ambulance shows up; they pull a stretcher out; she sits down and they take her away.“I’m a Close Friend of the Owner.”",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello front desk friendos. I've got a little time to kill and am feeling sentimental so I thought I would vent a little about the rooms the break my heart.

I know I've touched on the family members who drop off their unwell siblings/parents before, (you know, the ones who require assistance and training that we do not have as front desk folks) But this is a different kind of sad. It's time to talk about kids.

A lot of the most tragic stories I've experienced in my hotel career involve kids and their pathetic excuses for parents. Let's talk about Dejected Dad, or DD for short.

When I started working at my current location, I was told that DD was on our DNR list. No one really explained why, but told me to not let them stay if they booked with us. A few months pass and a trainee accidentally checks in DD, who booked through Crooking.com.  I then find out why they are DNR.

DD books  a standard room with two queen beds and then piles his five children into the room. These kids are between the age of toddler and around twelve years old. He then LEAVES THEM COMPLETELY ALONE in the room while he goes to work, has dinner, runs errands, and just generally isn't present.

Let me reiterate; the oldest child in this room with four other children is only twelve years old.

Our staff had no idea this was happening until  housekeeping started complaining about the state of the room after check out.  It was, of course, one of the filthiest rooms I have ever seen in my life. You see, DD would go to Walmart and  buy bags of junk food, leaving it in the room for them to eat while he was away. Cheetos in the air conditioner, jello smeared across every surface, chips ground into the carpet, etc. Because you know, THEY'RE WITHOUT SUPERVISION. We're pretty sure he didn't even stay in the room. (still makes my blood boil)

We finally caught on that they were by themselves when someone checking due outs said that the twelve year old would come  to the door when they knocked. DD has a nasty habit prior DNR of making housekeeping force them to come down after check out to extend. The twelve year old would then lie to the housekeeper (poor darling) and say ""My dad will be back in a few minutes."" We would call the dad and he would come in from outside the building and renew the reservation. We then realized that he was leaving the children by themselves. Management decided they could not stay here anymore and they left.

Well, our DNR system is basically a note we keep on the desk (OnQuerty doesn't have a feature to block reservations and even if it did, they book through Crooking.com to avoid this regardless) and a few months later he got checked back in somehow. I was Executive Housekeeper at the time (learning all departments) and this time I had a chance to talk to him while forcing him to check out.

Dude straight up told me that they were alone because their mom was crazy and he didn't feel safe leaving them with her. He said he still had to work and no one could watch them. He said that the mom had custody but he would have to come take them away sometimes  because the mom would be having an 'episode'. He didn't have room for them at his house so he kept them here. Did I also mention that this was during the school year? We never saw him take those kids to school, not once.

Guys.

What?

What do you even say to that? Credit where credit is due for removing your children from a dangerous situation but keeping them cooped in a tiny hotel room unattended for long periods of  time is ALSO a form of child abuse. I honestly didn't know what to say. I told him that management determined that they could not stay with us and that he may want to look into child protection. He shrugged and they left.

I haven't seen them for almost a year but it breaks my heart every time I think about it.

Anyone else have a situation like this one?Rooms that break my heart.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work at a small hotel in a small town. There are other hotels but we’re the newest and best quality, only a 3 star

Anyhoot, after the GM and HSKP leave, the FD agent is the only one left. If there are 20+ arrivals 2 FDA will be on. If for some reason nobody is there to watch the desk, we put up a sign saying either “ring the bell” or “front desk agent is in -place-“ and it’s just standard practice to ring a bell that’s on the counter if you don’t see anyone at said counter. 

We have an indoor pool and the deck needs to be mopped every night because we let the public swim and they make it really messy and gross. This needs to be done at 10PM (when the pool closes) and if there are any arrivals left (doesn’t happen often) we put up a sign that reads “Please find the front desk agent in the pool room down the hall” pretty plain and clear. We also have security camera ministers in a place where gsts can just lean a bit and see them. 

I was alone and only had one arrival so I went to do the pool. This construction crew was yet to check in but I wasn’t worried, I don’t take long in the pool. Put the pool sign up and the bell beside it and went on my merry way. 

In the middle of mopping this big dude comes and slams on the glass, obviously mad. I’m like okay whatever buddy like I put the sign up. 

The leader of the crew chewed me out because “he didn’t even know where I was until he saw me moving on the camera monitor” and how that’s such bad practice and they’ve been waiting for 20 minutes they’re tired and they’re paying for a room they expect better service and all kinds of bullshit. 

I’m like okay I must’ve not put the sign up no worries. Nope, it’s right there, beside the bell. 

Pointed it out, he was pissed. Like FFS just fucking read the sign. 

Not just the pool. People will just stand by the desk waiting for me to magically appear while the sign clearly says I’m not there

"Hello all! Don’t know how it took me this long to find this subreddit... 

I work in a 50+ rooms boutique hotel in Paris. My favourite story from 2019 has to be the middle aged American couple who showed up in the middle of trade fair season (99% of the city fully booked and highest rates of the year), for check-in and showed me a confirmation voucher. For a resort. In Spain. 

Me: ...sir, that’s the wrong hotel.
Guest: Oh, really?
Me: You’re... in the wrong country?
Guest, only mildly surprised: Oh. How interesting. Our Uber brought us here from the train station though? 

The best thing about it was how his wife and him seemed unfazed by the whole thing. They just kept repeating “how curious” and sat in the lobby for two hours looking for an available hotel. I had to escape to the back office at one point to laugh because I couldn’t hold it anymore.

Like there will be some guests that come in and will be kind of dicks about the rate, and in those instances I usually stand my ground am like ""hell no I ain't giving you shiiiiiet!"" but then you get those guest that try and guilt trip you, ""oh, my wife left me, isn't there a lower rate you can give me."" ""I am all by myself, I can't pay that much.."" ""My husbands in the hospital, is that the best you can do for me."" and its just like fuck okay jeez will 10-20 off your room rate make the guilt tripping stop!

"So I've been working in a really nice hotel for a small southern town for the past 7 months and Just had this happen to me this morning... 

By the way, I've been working up my karma for a while to post here and I've accumulated so many stories but I just can't remember them in as much detail anymore! Hopefully some that I had wanted to post will come back to me lol.

I worked last night and checked in this really obnoxious couple. The husband was jacked but kept going on about how he was afraid of ghosts (we're certified haunted) and was just trying to be cute. Whatever. I come back in this morning, try to get going and all. I love when there's nobody up yet and its all quiet and peaceful so I can get my work done before it gets crazy. So I'm enjoying my coffee and I hear this ginormous yell. This jacked up guy was going HAM in our tiny fitness center... lifting weights, running, jumping rope, ALLLLL of it! Half this stuff was just for show I thought! Anyway, the fitness center is right behind the front desk, So I keep hearing this guy grunt and groan and count reps at full blast. People started to come downstairs and start their day and they definitely noticed it too. I just had never heard a grown man moan and groan like that in public and think he was so cool for it. I was really not sure if I should have gone it and told him to tone it down because it was making everyone so uncomfortable!!

Just thought that was super weird and wanted to share because I haven't read any stories like that. lol.

"Our parking can be confusing. It's a structure beneath the hotel but you enter right outside the lobby. When looking at it, it almost looks like the garage would be hidden inside the building so if you don't know you need to go DOWN upon entering, if can be incredibly confusing. We also share it with an office building on the same block so if you're not paying attention, you'll end up in the office building when you come up.

I always try to tell people as plainly and clearly as I can and 99% of the time, as long as they're listening, there's no problems at all and they thank me for the good directions. But every now and then, I get some arrogant douche who just walks away when I'm in the middle of my monologue about how to park. I get it, they've been in the car for hours and just want to get upstairs, but if they decide to opt out of the directions, them getting lost is entirely their fault.

One guy last night did exactly that, walked away after I gave him the keys and ignored me when I tried to tell him I needed to show him where to park. I just say ""fuck it"" and go back to the desk, preparing for him to come back furious that he couldn't find it. Sure enough, I get a phone call from him. It's late at night so the office building is closed. He's standing by THEIR elevator wondering why it's not working. I try to tell him but he's of course just fuming about how he'll never stay here again. He's saying shit about how a Maliott property should never make their guests stand outside like this and that I should buzz him in immediately. I tell him he's at the wrong elevator so I can't do that but of course it goes right over his head. Eventually he shuts up and let's me explain. He makes it to the correct elevator and when he walks through the lobby, he just continued to curse and demand for the managers business card. (LOL, what can the manager do? Is she supposed to be able to facilitate the demolition and complete redesign of our property just so this asshole can find the parking easier next time?)If you didn't want to listen, don't bitch at me because you got lost!!!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Standard phone reservation,  and a short interaction that goes as follows, after beginning to take her details:

""Oh wait I forgot we're picking up a puppy on our way there. Is that allowed?""

C: ""Well can you register it as one?""

(Internal facepalm. Mind you, this was apparently a brand new dog she was getting.)

Me: ""I'm sorry, but unless it has the relevant government documentation we cannot accept it as a service animal.""

C: ""Oh. Okay then.""

Why do people use non service dogs as such to try and get away with things? It takes away from people who actually have true service animals and need them for medical purposes. It astounds me people will try and break the rules, every time.

I guess at the very least she didnt throw a fit about it.

Edit to clarify: my exact wording for government documentation was more along the lines of ""it is required to be registered through the government to be considered a service animal.""

"Over the years, I've gotten to know the doggies in the neighborhood from a little distance. Our building is pet-free which is nice professionally (no potty messes in the hallways) even though I like animals. When it's really hot out and I see a good boy or girl walking down the street, I bring out some cold water for the doggo. I think it's being a good neighbor to the community even though my boss couldn't probably care less.

Anyways, there are three particularly cartoonish dogs that I get to see regularly and cheer me up.

The first is a longhaired miniature dachshund. Our street might be one of the windiest in the city so most of the time I see this little guy walking, his hair is blowing back and you can tell he's giving it his all to complete the walk. Owner isn't too different. Someday I'd like to get a pic of him walking in the wind but so far, I haven't quite got it. I could see them as a New Yorker cartoon with a sparse caption like ""I'm a boat, I'm a boat.""

The second belongs to some sort of young professional. He's a lab and a good boy but he requires a lot of coaching from the owner. They stop every 50 meters or so so have him sit and show a little self control. They are super cute together and you can tell they have a lot of give and take. They work really hard to be good to each other and it's darling. They are the first part of a romantic comedy where a guy comes along and can't compete with the dog.

Third is the winner for me. He's a white whippet that hunches over as he slowly walks down the street. He's owned by a white old man that hunches over as he slowly walks down the street. I've never seen a dog and owner look so perfectly matched. It's like a Norman Rockwell cartoon walking by. Whenever I see them I get super excited like I'm seeing a shooting star.

"So I've worked at hotels for 3 years now and I'm always baffled on how management will change things/policies that end up pissing off our guests.

My complaint today is that I just kind of realized that we took our previously COMPLIMENTARY toothbrushes and toothpastes and are now charging guests $2 EACH for them... They are about the same quality as our before complimentary toothbrushes and instead of our mini single use packet we now have a travel sized toothpaste. I'm just confused why when we were before throwing people a bone we are now trying to profit off of it. Oh you need to brush your teeth (because who likes going to bed/starting off your day with rancid ass breath) that will be $4 dollars...

I've also worked at a Milton where we went from giving all the honors members bottles of water for FREE to then only charging the LOWEST tier member (^(blue)) $2 per bottle. Way to go Milton a big company feeding off of the people that don't give you ENOUGH money you have to charge them $2 for water... I'm just mad confused since they are the lowest tier and you would you know want them to move up aka STAY AT YOUR HOTEL more, so why are you taxing them on water when you can simply give it to them for free, making them happy and then staying at the hotel more, idk maybe I'm crazy.Why do management change things just to then piss off our guests, almost alienating them....",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"
Good morning everyone! Last January I took a job as a Guest Services Attendant at a five star resort in east coast US wine country. For the most part, the job is mostly just bell and valet tasks, with the odd set of room drops for corporate bookings, and essentially everything else the front desk attendants can't leave to do themselves. One of our most well-reviewed services, however, is a complimentary luxury car service to take guests to local restaurants and vineyards.

Our resort has a fleet of imported luxury cars, each valued around $100k new and driving people around in them is by far the most fun I have on the job.  Every once in a while we'll have a large corporate group rent out the tasting room at one of the nearby vineyards, and it's our job to bring guests to and from that venue. Anyone who's worked at a similar property can tell you, resort guests like to get wicked wasted.  This story is about one of those evenings.

So, the cast:

GS: Guest Services (Me, driving a very expensive sedan.)

M: Male guest

F: Female guest

Both appeared to be in their mid 30's


That evening we transported the group of guests (about 30 in total) to the vineyard without any real incident. Took the other GS staff and I about half an hour total, no big deal. The vineyard was about 8 minutes away. That evening, as we were making runs to bring guests back to the resort, it became very clear that the party at the vineyard was ""a lot of fun."" People were stumbling out to our cars, hollering at each other like children, and in the case of M and F, pawing each other all over.

I had the pleasure of picking M &amp; F up for the return trip. It started poorly; they were so drunk that the first thing they did was try to climb inside a coworker's car, not realizing there were already people inside. We got that sorted, and they sat together in the back of my sedan.

Before we had even pulled out of the vineyard lot, M starts up with the worst, high-school-cool-ass pick up lines. Including asking me to mention ""how hot F was."" Since I work 5 star, I'm not allowed to refuse a guest's request without offering an alternative, so I just say ""Yes, she's very attractive."" And F apparently appreciated it, since they immediately started making out.

It's dark out, so I can't really see what's going on in the back seat. I hear the sound of shuffling cloth, and then this exchange:

F: Oh... S-sorry about my haaand... ;)

M: Babe, I'm not Santa Claus.... (long pause) I don't care if you're naughty or nice...

More shuffling cloth, then a soft moan from F. A moment later, the very distinct sound of a woman getting (as I later explained to the department manager) ""manually stimulated by her partner""

At this point, I just keep driving and try to pretend I don't exist. Keep in mind the drive from the vineyard to the resort is literally 8 MINUTES, and they couldn't keep it in their pants.

 A few minutes later, we get back to the resort and the supervisor on duty opens the door to let F out. She casually steps out of the car and puts her underwear back on, right on the front drive, then walks into the resort. M follows her with a quick ""thanks, man"" but no tip. I'd bet F got the tip later if you know what I mean.

M walks inside, and I look at my supervisor. He looks very surprised, but is trying not to laugh. I just tell him I'm gonna go wipe down the seats since we have more rides to do.

After I disinfected the seats, one of the women in the next carload I took back to the resort threw up in front of the front desk. 

I had been working this job for two weeks at that point. Was quite a memorable night.

Five Star is a fun time. I have other stories about a gaggle of coked-up personal injury attorneys, packs of screaming moms on a weekend away from the kids, and plenty else. I'm sure I'll get around to them at some point. Thanks for reading!A Five Star Drive",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"From time to time, I'll write about characters here at my building. This little ongoing story is about one of the amazing, successful older professional women I get to work with. She's a lawyer and works in a judge sort of position. She is smart as a whip and a force to be reckoned with.

Rather than wake the mailman from his slumber, she has waited for over an hour, eagle-eyed for him to come along and empty the box. I don't know what she's going to do when he get's here but I'm excited.

"So, English is my second language, and although I can speak it on a pretty high level, I've had some (very) bad days.

One of them happened 3 years ago, on a quiet January night. I (23F, 20 at the time) used to work in a small town chain hotel, and tended the front desk by myself. Me coming in during winter was unusual, as I was normally away for university, but my boss needed me that weekend so I came in, very tired and with a rusty English after basically not speaking it for a couple months.

Around 9PM, a car pulled up. A white haired man came out, leaving his wife in the car (or so I thought), and entered the lobby. As he inquired about my rates, I confirmed with him he only needed one bed, and suggested a regular Queen room, which he agreed to book. Until then, everything ran smoothly.

As I started filling his register card (yes, we filled walk-in register cards by hand), I figured it would be a good idea to confirm how many people there were, as one does. But instead of going with my regular ""for how many people?"", which always did the trick, my brain took an alternate path and thought:

"" Why not go with *just for the two of you?*"", as I was convinced at that point there were two of them.

You might ask: ""but what's wrong with asking *just for the two of you?*""... The question is not what ***is*** wrong, but what ***could go*** wrong. The answer is ***a lot***.

&amp;#x200B;

My tired brain couldn't handle this sudden change of routine, so it went like this:

Me: Just for the two of us?

Customer, rather confused and taken aback: huh?

Me, stuttering a bit: so, just for the two of us?.. huh sorry, I mean, just the two of you?

C: Huh, no, it's just me.

Me, rather confused and still stuttering: Oh, yes, sure, sorry.. ^(I had thought.. there were two of you).. so just for one person then... 

For some reason, he seemed to have gotten quite uncomfortable, but I figured he was annoyed by my rusty English. (as it often happens, even in a region where no one speaks English)

&amp;#x200B;

I  finished checking him in in a very awkward atmosphere... well, at least for him. Why just for him, you ask? Because it hadn't hit me yet that I had replaced *you* with *us* and thereby literally suggested to an oblivious old man we take a room together. At first, I just felt embarrassed that I had assumed he wasn't alone. But about half an hour later, as I was sitting behind my desk, enjoying the silence, I replayed the conversation in my head and the embarrassment hit me like never before. I wanted to disappear deep into the ground. Not only had I said something incredibly unprofessional and not apologized properly, I potentially could have put my 20 y/o self in danger, had the man not been as decent. 

I still think of that poor old man sometimes, wishing I could've told him how much I didn't mean to say that. Oh well.Awkward check-in for the two of us",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It's the beginning of what looks to be a very slow 3-11 shift for me today.  I've only been here for just over an hour and I've already had a pretty amusing interaction with a guest. 

A guy comes into the lobby, he's got a piece of paper in hand and doesn't come up to the desk right away, but sort of looks a bit bewildered....walks through our small lobby, looks back and forth down the halls leading off of it, and then comes over to the desk.

The first thing he says is ""Where's the mall?"". 

We are just around the corner from a large retail hub, that includes a large indoor mall.  It's only about 1.5 miles away and super easy to get to. So I explain the directions from the hotel to him. 

He is still looking down at the piece of paper he has in hand, and says he thinks he may be at the wrong hotel. 

He hands me the paper and it's his confirmation e-mail and it shows that he is in the right place, which I confirm for him. 

""Oh shoot....I must have booked the wrong place then, she's gonna kill me"" he says. 

He says he meant to book at the place that was attached to the mall. But he swears it was here that he called and spoke to someone.  

There are not, in fact, any hotels directly next to the mall, and certainly none that are attached to it in any way. I inform him of this and he puts his hand on his forehead and reiterates exasperatingly.. ""She is gonna KILL me"". 

He goes and sits on one of the lobby couches and is on his phone for a few minutes. 

He comes back to the desk with his phone and shows me that the call he made was to our phone number and when he asked if we had any kind of breakfast, someone here told him that we do, and it's served just across the mall. 

A little light bulb comes on in my head....and I think I'm starting to understand what happened. 

I tell him that we do serve a breakfast here, and that it is served right across the hall from the interior lobby door.  I asked perhaps the person he spoke to had said ""right across the HALL"", and not ""right across the MALL""? 

I'm braced for frustration, but the guy just busts out laughing.  

""Oh god.....you're probably right.  Ooooh man.  My wife's going to be pretty disappointed I guess.  When she said she'd just be sitting around bored while I was at work I promised her she could spend time shopping at the mall onsite"".  

I say, ""well, we may not have the mall here at the hotel, but it's pretty lucky that you did still book a hotel that just happened to be pretty close to one?"" 

""Does it have a Sephora store?"" he asks.  

I tell him it does and he says ""Alright! I'm saved! I shall live through this day after all!""  ""I'm certain a couple minutes in an Uber isn't going to be too much hassle for her!""  

I get him all checked in and he was on his way. 

Not going to lie, it is extremely refreshing to get a guest that handles a misunderstanding well instead of blaming the hotel for their own mistake for once.   

I hope his wife enjoys the mall.Just across the mall.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

I've been at this property for 9 months now. The amount of times I've had to call maintenance (usually fire alarm related) has been unreal. I'm sure he hate when my cell # pops up on his work phone. 😂

Well tonight I go to wipe down the tables out by the pool area and I see the pump room door is cracked open and the light is on. That's not a good sign so I open it to make sure no one's in there or anything. I open the door and water is spewing all over the place. Think to myself ""oh great, now I have to call Maintenance... He's gonna hate me."" So I call, no answer. Hmmm... Unusual. Well I go back to wiping tables.

"I’m not exactly sure what to make of this situation. I’m pissed, and I want to see other people’s perspectives. 

Alright, I work as a Night Auditor on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I’ve worked here about a month, but I have around a year of Night Audit experience. 

We only have 2 Night Auditors, which I think is normal. I’m 20 and she’s 21, if that’s important. But we’re the only two who actually know how to run the audit. So if one of us gets sick, the other person has to be available, or we’re in big trouble. Do you see where this is going? 

Well, the Other Night Girl (ONG) just found out she’s pregnant. And with pregnancy comes.. morning sickness. She’s been sick A LOT. So I’ve had to cover a lot. Which is fine! I get more on my paycheck, and I normally don’t have much going on so I’m pretty much always free. 

But this weekend was my birthday. Friday the 7th was my actual birthday, and I got asked to work. I said no, since it was my birthday, and I was busy celebrating and seeing family. The next night was my birthday party, a sleepover. I got asked to work, I said I couldn’t. 

The next day, we were all going to celebrate at Dave and Buster’s. Of course, I got a text from ONG that said “I am NOT working tonight, you are.”

Excuse me? You can’t just text me and tell me I HAVE to cover for you (unless maybe it’s a manager). I texted my manager and said I couldn’t work because I would be getting home very late. I didn’t respond to ONG because, quite frankly, I didn’t feel that I had to. 

Now it’s Monday night, and, of course, I got asked to work. So that’s where I am now. Am I wrong to be upset about this? I’m fine covering for her, no problem. But the fact that she just texted me and doesn’t even ask, just TELLS me that I’m covering for her, that pissed me off so bad.

"Another freaking flight crew.

Once again they are at the wrong hotel, and giving me attitude over THEIR mistake.

How freaking hard is it to read the itinerary and direct the Uber drive to the correct address?

Surely the company booking their stay didn't just give them a hotel name and send them on an Easter egg hunt.

There's 4 of them, 2 of each, and the one dude saunters in and tells me they are here to check in, and that the reservation was *just* made.  I knew this to not be the case, because we. are. sold. out.  Plus inventory was NMQ, so ain't now reservations getting through to oversell me.

I thought perhaps that they made a reservation for the next night thinking they could check in now...y'all know how that goes.  But it turns out like it did in a previous post of mine about flight crews, that they needed to be at the same hotel as before that is 15 minutes away in another part of town.

This flight crew looked *wiped out,* I felt kind of bad for them, but not by much because they were still grim, awkward, and completely rude.   IT'S.  NOT.  MY.  FAULT.  YOU.  DON'T.  KNOW.  HOW.  TO.  READ.  AN.  ITIN--E--RARY!

The male flight attendant is taking business cards and writing things down, as if he is keeping track of some shit.  But if he could keep track of shit, he would be in his hotel room right now taking a shit, and not giving me shit in my hotel.  

I remember what happened the last time, and tell them that they are probably supposed to be at the other hotel and tell them the address, and they stare at me as if I just spoke Dothraki.  The lead guy puts in his airpods (eyeroll), and starts making calls.  I stand there, delighted that they aren't staying with me, when the lead guy asks me if the address he has written down was correct.  I tell him, ""yes, that's the address I gave you a few minutes ago.""   I literally had given him that address before he put in his airpods to ignore me and make phone calls.  Mmmkay.

So, we have it sorted out where they are to really be staying.  They are now on their way, yes?  

Nope.  They sit in my lobby, awkwardly for another. 20. minutes!  What the hell?!?  I told them where the restrooms were in case they wanted to freshen up, then just walked to the back and sat down.  This is crazy awkward.  They hadn't even called an Uber yet!  The other guy of the group was just standing tall in the middle of my freaking lobby, and the two women were seated, and one of them was sitting wide legged with a skirt on lol.  I shit you not.

I will say that this group wasn't *as* dickish as the other flight crew I posted about.  This one was awkward, and looked ran through, and I'm taking into account that they were probably as tired as they looked as a reason for the sour dispositions.  I get it.  But flight crews, man...get it together lol.Here We Go Again...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey all,

This just happened and I'm ready for a beer. To start off, we have been having issues with our WiFi. It will allows some phones to connect in the rooms but not others, however, guests can bring their phones down to the lobby, connect to the WiFi down here, and are able to stay connected as they go up to their room. It's kind of a hassle but it's a solution. Also, if folks leave the hotel and come back after connecting to the WiFi, their phones automatically re-connect. 

Tonight, Verizon had outages across our state. A guest called down asking why his phone isn't connecting to the internet, I explained the WiFi situation to him, and he responds with ""I don't even have service so when is the internet going to come back up?""

I ask if he has Verizon. He asks again when the internet is going to come back up. I tell him the internet is up, he just needs to connect in the lobby. He asks AGAIN when the internet is going to come back up. I ask him AGAIN if he has Verizon. He finally responds to that question with ""Well, yeah. But what does that have to do with the internet?""

I explain to him that he doesn't have service because Verizon is down and since he doesn't want to come down to the lobby to connect to the WiFi, he isn't getting internet. I apologized for the inconvenience and he says, ""Well what are you going to do about it?""

I asked, ""About what, sir?""

He says, ""About the internet.""

I said, ""Sir, I can't do anything about the internet.""

He said, ""That's what I thought."" And hung up.

"I've been seeing a few posts on here recently about nice guests, so I thought I would share a story about some nice guests I had. 

I went to a community college and took a Hospitality and Tourism course, and it was divided between Hotel Operations and Food and Beverage. I didn't like the F&amp;B aspect as much, but I still did my best. Our class sometimes paired up with the Culinary class and we would serve dinners for the public in our dining room, and there was a couple from town that had been going to these dinners for like 10 years. They liked to see how the students progressed throughout the year, and they loved the food. 

After I graduated, I moved to the city to work in a hotel. I remember on my second day, an older couple got off the elevator and went into the breakfast room. The man looked at me, and I thought he looked familiar. It was the couple that went to our dinners. They came to talk to me, and still remembered me even though it had been over a year. 

Fast forward to last fall, and I started working on a cruise ship. I had my F&amp;B instructor on Facebook and she messaged me saying that she told that couple what I was up to now and they were so proud of me. 

I haven't seen them since the time in the hotel, but I thought it was so sweet of them to still ask about me after all these years.The guests that still ask about me years later",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"(for those wondering, the translation is '[you are an ambulance](https://reddit.app.link/ony9zMTFX3)')

I have said it before, and I will say it again: Night Audit is 90% dull boring routine, 9% annoying problem I gotta deal with, and 1% *PURE RAW TERROR*.

Tonight, gentle readers, I am rather solidly in that one particular percentage point. Whoof.

""It's a nice quiet night,"" says my coworker, ""We've got a Korean student group in, but they're being good, and everyone is in.""

""Great!"" says your humble narrator, who then settles in to enjoy his delicious tacos. I'm just polishing off Taco Number Two, when the phone rings.

""Front Desk, this is Skwrl speaking, how may I help you?""

""Ahh.. yes. Emer... emergency? We are having emergency? Please, call... hospital?""

Annnd there it is, the adrenaline dump. No time to panic, things need to get done now. *Now*, now.

""Yes, I understand. You need an ambulance. I will call them for you.""

At this point, two of the students come out of the elevator, ""Please call the nine one one, our friend he is.. shocking?"" \*mimes strangling*

""Choking? Yes, calling now."" I'd already hung up on the other room and quickly dial. I give the dispatcher the address and room number. One of the two students goes upstairs, the second remaining behind.

I know my panic was minor compared to his - strange country, barely able to speak the language, and a friend in dire straits. Still, I'm in full Super Skwrl Mode, by which I mean trying very hard not to scream and run around in circles.

""How long will it take?""

""Five minutes, probably less."" The local EMTs used to use our parking lot for rest breaks/naps. Kinda wish they still did.

Three tense minutes, during which I'm trying to find a rooming list, as the students didn't know where their professor/translator was. Spoilers; there was no rooming list. Argh. There is a flashing of lights. 

The students are a bit worried and confused because the fire department shows up first, ""No no, it's okay, they come first for emergencies."" I tell them, ""That is the medical truck."" Sure enough, the ambulance is maybe thirty seconds behind them. There is a bustling and commotion.

About twenty minutes after the first call, the student is wheeled out the door to the waiting ambulance. He looked okay, awake and alert, though a bit worse for wear.

Some minor consternation, much discussion in Korean. The professor/guide/translator is found, brought up to speed. I tell him where the hospital is (other side of town, unfortunately). He heads off with some of the students.

So... All quiet now. Tacos are cold and soggy, and the adrenaline is wearing off. Super Skwrl has taken off his cape and put on his glasses.

"# Hello this is my very first post on here so its kinda long but bare with me guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I come into my 3-10 shift as always and follow up with first shift on any important notes, since it was Sunday one of a slower days, all she had to tell me was that a guest who was supposed to checkout extended their stay and paid cash and when we have guest pay cash we also require a 100$ cash deposit for incidentals, so that's good to know just in case they decide to checkout early and that was pretty much it, mind you my co worker has been working for the company for about 4 years right ahead of me ,myself, going on year 3 in August. anyways I say that to say that we don't make many if not any mistakes compared to newer employees.

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward after 1st shift left and about an hour into my shift goes by and the lady who extended her stay comes down and slapped her purse on the counter and proceeded to say she feels like my colleague gipped her out her change even tho checkout was at noon and if you extended you stay and keys it would be around that time since keys erase after noon on departure day...so your kinda late but ok?

  so already being a little skeptical but being me I immediately became concerned as you should being the main line of contact and the only one there at the time plus that's just common customer service, My exact word were ""And Are you sure you looked in all areas of your purse? because that's not like my coworker, shes been working here for years and has never had any occurrences of that nature, but I will reach out to her for more details"" ""I'm Thinking and hoping it just a misunderstanding"" and as soon as I said that the guest flipped shit and started SCREECHING yelling ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" ""SO, YOU THINK I'M MAKING THIS UP?"" ""YOU THINK I'M LYING AND THAT I'M A PSYCHO?"" ""I KNOW WHAT THE F#$\* I HAD AND ITS NOT THERE NOW SO SHE TOOK IT"" I assured her that was not the case at all and if it was I wouldn't entertain the issue further than I had, I then said in a stern voice ""In EVERY situation of something coming up missing, with lack of evidence there is ALWAYS more than one possibility, That doesn't mean I assume otherwise it just means I want to see the issue through thoroughly and exhaustively especially dealing with such a potential security risk. long story short she walked away upset and I called my coworker not once but twice and I'm glad she didn't answer both times, but almost  2 and half hours go by and the GUEST calls down to tell me You Guessed IT! SHE FOUND THE MONEY in her purse in a front zipper pocket? ugh but she apologized, But in a very condescending way tbh but luckily I'm good at pretending so I just said the favorite line "" oh, you're fine"" line and left it at that.  

I'm Really good at handling angry customers but I cant believe how fast this one wanted to make an issue. My coworker ended up calling me back right before I was about to get off and told me that the guest is actually homeless at the moment and I felt like 20% more empathy for her but you should NEVER go off on someone who's trying to help you. What did I say wrong? Was I supposed to trash my coworker and be like ""OH MY GOSH REALLY? SHE STOLE A PIECE OF MY GUM ONE TIME TOO SO I BET SHE DID""  like no.""Are you trying to say I'm psycho??""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"One night we sold out. I was very sick, but overnight and first shift called out so I'm working a sold out 3-11 shift barely able to stand, coughing up a storm-- I later learned I had pneumonia. Anyway, This guy walks in and asks if we have any rooms. I tell him we do not. He pulls out his phone. 


""Online it says you do.""

""Well that is not accurate. We do not have any rooms.""

""Well, it looks like [OTA] will let me book a room, what if I do that?""

""Please do not Sir, we do not have any more rooms and the only thing you will get is a refund in three to five business days.""

""Online it says you have rooms, why can't you give me a room?""

""We are sold out. I'm sorry the online inventory is not accurate, but we cannot honor any new reservations. If you didmake one I would be forced to cancel it and refund you.""


Thankfully, this did it and the guest left. I just have to wonder why he thought that booking through a third party online would magic up an extra clean room.

"Tonight was a good one. I got to meet our new operations manager (old one got fired for being an idiot), I got to sing in an impromptu karaoke competition in the lobby, and I got to eat for free. But the best things sometimes come from the most mundane sources.

Tonight while working the desk, I had a group of three older ladies come in looking for a room. They came in looking for a room for three women and they were a bit shaken up. They'd showed up to their AirBnB which they'd reserved months before, only to find it occupied by a bunch of pot-smoking teenagers. They didn't feel safe at their AirBnB, so they came to my Schmoliday Out looking for a place to stay. I put them in one of our corner rooms with two queens and a pull-out, and they were good.

About 20 minutes later, one of the Anti-Karens came down asking if they could extend their stay at our hotel. I verified that they could, and kept the AAA rate that I'd given them since they'd suffered enough from AirBnB. She was super thankful, more than I expected given what they'd been through. After she left, I realized I'd forgotten to tell them the updated costs. So I called up and let them know of the updated costs with the discount, and they debated for all of two seconds before calling down to tell me they'd be taking it. I locked it in, told them we can split $800 between multiple cards at check-out, and bid them good night. Before I hung up, I heard someone in the background call me an angel... I can't say I didn't blush. That was the pick me up I needed after getting bitched out five times last night.

"I'm so angry about this entire situation.

I've worked at the same hotel for 3 years. My GM (I'll call him Jake) and his family managed the hotel. They were incredible! They took great care of all us employees and treated us like family.

Unfortunately, the hotel was sold by the owners. New management kept all the employees, but Jake and his family were relocating immediately to another hotel across the country. Jake, being the wonderful person he is, promoted me to assistant GM before the transition to help me out and give me a good position. Come to find out, it didn't include a pay raise yet. I was so shocked by how sudden everything happened, I didn't think to ask any details.

The new owner (I'll call him Ron) would also be GM of the hotel. My first interaction with Ron was very brief. He seemed like a decent guy. There are a lot of improvements he wants to make, which would be great for the property.

The very next day, I have a few barely legible handwritten notes to call several places to create new accounts. Not just for my hotel, but for his other hotel properties, too! I had no idea what sort of services these were, nor do I have access to the necessary info. Ron owns and manages other hotels in town so he isn't always on the property. Understandable. I've been asking to sit down with him to discuss what he expects from me as a new assistant GM and ask what sort of pay raise he thought was reasonable.

It took an entire week before Ron squeezed in a few minutes with me before he had to leave again. I barely had time to ask my questions about all the new things he asked me to do. He dodged most of it by saying, ""I know you can do it."" I was apprehensive, but agreed.

Lastly, I mentioned that I was open to discussing a pay raise. This is what made my blood boil; Ron said, ""We'll see how well you perform, and we'll discuss it in a few months.""

The balls on this guy! I said, ""With my recent promotion and all the new responsibilities I've taken on for multiple properties, you want to wait a few months before I get a raise?""

He said, ""Yes. You make a pretty good wage. (I make $2 per hour more than minimum wage.) If you do well, you'll earn a raise.""

I said, ""Ok."" Then I immediately submitted my resume to other locations. Not happening. He's delusional.

"As I was standing in my hotel lobby, enjoying my quiet night, reading a book, drinking coffee, the lobby door opened and stood there a dog and a lady. I got excited because I love dogs, and I started baby talking to the dog like a normal human. Welp, the lady instantly starting screaming at me, 

""THIS IS MY SERVICE DOG DO NOT LOOK OR TALK TO HIM""

Ok game on, so I just looked at her and told her he needs his service vest on. I wasn't going to say sorry for that, he had no indication that it was a service dog. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW DUDE?!!!!

She asked if I had any rooms available, I said yes, they are starting at 107.00+tax, and my GM doesn't like it when we lower the rate during the winter months, we are not busy at all, so that was the rate, it was staying. She asked if there were any lower rates in the area, so I read her off the lowest rates. She looked at me like I was stupid and then started talking to me like I was 5, woman I am a 23 year old college student, please back off. I continued to read off the rates, she started yelling and slowly saying, ""ARE YOU DYSLEXIC? DOOOO YOUUU HAAAVVEEEE A MENTALLL ISSUUEEE?""

I looked at her very confused and slowly said no and asked if she was ok, because she didn't seem ok? She rolled her eyes at me and said she was fine. She then asked if we had a scanner she can use, I told her we don't and told her where the nearest fedex is to scan something.

She asked about my fax machine, I told her I will gladly fax anything she needs, she started asking and demanding for a scanner and a fax machine, and then started demanding random things, along with random questions. Every time I tried to answer a question, she asked if I was stupid. It got to the point I flat out told her I am not stupid, I do not appreciate her talking to me in that manner and to please stop. For a minute her attitude changed, and she started asking if she can borrow my car. 

No? Who asks a random stranger if they can borrow a car?! 

When I told her no, she said fine that she will try not to wreck her car. Yeah, that doesn't help anything? 

As she was leaving to her car, a woman with two small dogs was walking in. I love these dogs, they both have cancer and are here for treatment; they're named Teddy and Bell. Well, Teddy got excited to see the dog the woman had, and of course, he started parking, getting excited, being a dog, and the woman started screaming at the owner of Teddy and Bell. The guest with Teddy and Bell walked in and  looked so confused. Me too ma'am. Me too. 

So, she left for an hour, I was checking in a regular, well I know this regular likes to keep her space and doesn't like people too close. Crazy lady walked right up, stood inches away and asked for a room, and instantly started saying rude things about the owner of Teddy and Bell, ""she has the ugliest dogs ever, how dare she let them come at my service dog!"" I was checking the regular in, didn't even click ""check in"" yet, didn't even put her business in the company line! I told the crazy lady she needs to please back up and wait in line, she looked at me shocked, I told her again that she needs to wait in line and I will get to her once I am done checking this guest in. She rolled her eyes, demanded my name, I told my name, and asked if she wanted my managers email. She didn't even acknowledge what I asked her, she asked if I was a idiot and had a mental issue. No ma'am. I do not have a mental issue. But, I think you are giving me a migraine if that counts as a mental issue.I will end you lady and take your dog",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"So, I have a mace gun, and it looks like a real gun, safety and all, like bruh I dare somebody to come at me, it is always on me attached to my back, but I never had to use it, BUT THHHEEENNNNN....

It was winter time, I was minding my own business like usual, drinking coffee and reading a book, when a really weird dude came in. He asked to sit in the lobby and wait for his friend, I said sure, I figured his car broke down and was waiting for a ride, I thought he wouldn't be here long. Well, he sat in the far back corner of my hotel lobby staring at me. Ok, well I ignored him, I was enjoying my book. His friend came in, she had a reservation. She gave me the confirmation number, I found the reservation. However, her credit card declined. She said that is impossible and asked me to run it again, I did, still declined, I changed the expiration date, still nothing. 

Well, my hotel has to have card that authorizes for the full amount + 20 percent of incidentals, in case they destroy the room, it shows there is money on the card. We will take cash, but the card still has to authorize until they check out. 

She tried to pay with cash, her card did not authorize, and I told her to call her bank and let them know that it is you, and that is probably a flag on the account, happens a lot with hotels, she didn't listen to me and started telling me to take the cash. I told her I cannot do that, the card is declining. The creepy dude went to the men's restroom during this. 

She told me to delete the reservation and she wants me to print out ten copies of the cancellation number to make sure she doesn't get charged. I told her I can write down the cancellation number, and make her copies, but I cannot print them out, because the software we use won't let me. 

She started screaming at me and everything, she got very aggressive, she was getting violent, she was jumping at me and reaching for me.  I started slowly walking away to go to the back room, she started screaming at me more and then jumped over the counter at me, and I reached behind my back, took out the mace gun, and pointed it directly at her. I yelled at her to get out, I am not saying the cuss words I screamed, just know they were screamed. I yelled at her to leave, she got quiet, stared at me and starting walking towards me, I took the safety off, and quietly told her, ""I will shoot you dude"", she finally stopped and turned to leave but stopped in her tracks. I started counting down from 5 and she finally left.

I instantly ran and locked myself in the employee restroom, called 911, and stayed there till they got to the hotel. I told them there was a weird dude in the bathroom still that was associated with her. I called my GM and manager, they're friends so they're typically together, and they started watching the cameras to make sure he stayed in the bathroom till the police came. 

When the police came, I slowly came out and told them what happened, two went to the restroom and found him walking up and down the hall talking to himself. They asked what he was up to, and he started cussing them out and walking away from them. They pinned him to a wall and cuffed him, they  arrested him and as they were walking through the lobby, the guy was talking to them saying, ""I'm being arrested right now, what do you guys think I should do? They weren't very nice about it either!"" He was on something. Another cop came in and searched the restroom and found he did smoke something in the bathroom, but the creepy dude kept the evidence on him until the cops searched him.

The woman though was being questioned outside, refused to leave the property and claimed I took a gun out on her, understandable though, looks like a gun. The cop that was talking to her took my mace gun, and brought it to her to show her it wasn't a gun, he then took pictures for the court in case she tried to say I pointed a gun at her. 

The cops left after I gave my statement and a report, my boss told me to go to the break room and eat some ice cream to help calm me down, sugar makes me feel calm when I am stressed.

AG: a 5-star hotel with no room service? Tell me why you don’t offer room service now!

Me: because we don’t have a high enough request for it. 

AG: that’s a fucking lie. That’s a lie. I just called you now.

Me: sure. I can refill your minibar if you want, but we have no chefs in the building now so it’s not possible to get you heated food. Is there anything else I can bring to your room?

AG: yeah as I’ve said, I want a cheeseburger. Either you come with a burger or I’m gonna write a nasty review on LipAdvisor about your manager and your hotel right now.

Me: well, I wish we had chefs in the night time, but as I’ve said, there is no way for me to make you a cheeseburger now. 

AG: so do you really want me to go on LipAdvisor and write how fucking lazy your manager and you are? Your manager is probably home sleeping now not realizing that you don’t even have room service in the night.
 Your gonna give me a discount on my room rate because you don’t have room service now, right?  

Me: ehm no, we have never advertised that we have 24/7 room service 

AG: well then I’ll go on LipAdvisor. have a good evening, bye

Me: sure

He has still not written anything on LipAdvisor, but if he does I’m gonna get my hotel manager to write to LipAdvisor and tell them to remove this fake review. We have never advertised to have room service in the middle of the night.

"New Years Eve, a night to celebrate and party hard. Hard enough to have the cops called an hour after checking in. 

These two men came in and rented a hotel room at 11:15pm on New Years Eve, they got the most expensive suite in the hotel, the presidential suite. About ten minutes after checking in, one of the men from the room walked up to us and informed us that his friend had stole from him and asked us to call the police. We asked what he stole, he said, ""he stole my crack pipe and shoved it up his ass"", we thought this man was joking and laughed, why would somebody do that? Well, ten minutes go by, please keep in mind, the lobby is full of people, we have the ball drop on the t.v., we left the pool open longer for the kids in house to celebrate the new years, there are kids running up and down the hall, it was a good night. Well, my co worker walked past the presidential suite, where they were staying, and found the man who allegedly stole from the other man, sitting outside his door, butt naked, snorting cocaine off the door guarder and ripping the carpet up in the hallway to get the cocaine he thought was under the carpet. 

My co worker informed him if he does not get out of the hotel in ten minutes, we will be calling the police. The man threatened to kill my co worker, and told him he will have to kill him to get him out of the hotel. So, we called the cops, the cops came and chased him out of the building into the parking lot. The cops were running around trying to tackle him, they were shooting him with tasers, they shot him with tasers at least ten to twelve times! He did not go down! The man started to run back into the hotel, but he tripped outside the door and crawled in like it was something from the ring, saw my co worker, and then started crawling towards him aggressively. The cops were outside slipping on snow and ice, they couldn't get grip on their feet, they finally made it into the lobby before the man got behind the front desk and tackled him. They continued to taser him and beat him with night sticks, he would not stay down! It took ten cops to get him down long enough to cuff him, this process took them 45 minutes. During this entire thing, the other man who claimed the one on cocaine stole from him, was sitting pretty in the suite also doing cocaine. Cops went to the room and escorted him out of the building. The cops then helped us clean up blood and taser stickers that were all over the hotel lobby and parking lot.

However, we did not go into the room till that following morning.

We already new the carpet in the hall way was up from the crazy dude, but what we found in the room itself will forever haunt  the entire staff.

There was blood and feces all over the room. There was cocaine everywhere, heroin and meth on tables, needles and crack pipes, they dismantled every single piping system they had access to in the room and tried to use those for crack pipes. They took apart the microwave and mini fridge to try and use those for their drugs. Both televisions in the room were off the wall, which were mounted to start with. The bedding for all beds and couches were destroyed. And, in the middle of the room was the thing that started the entire circus show that was New Years Eve. A massive piece of feces covered in blood. And, within the feces, was the crack pipe. ""He really did shove it up his ass"", was all we could say as we stood in the room and looked at every aspect that was destroyed. 

We charged them over 2,000+ dollars for the cleaning and damages done to the room. A few days later, I got a call from the man that was escorted out of the building; he was asking for a refund of the stay, because he did not stay for the whole duration, and that he was kicked off the property for false accusations. All I said was, ""excuse me?"", because I have never heard something so ridiculous in my life. He repeated himself, and I asked if he remembered anything from that night. He told me he didn't remember a thing, but knows he got escorted out by police for no reason. I calmly told him what happened that night, and his friend is currently facing five charges against him for the circus show that took place in the hotel. He hung up, and a few minutes later called back freaking out, because he saw how much we charged him for everything that happened. My managers gave him the pictures of what the room looked like, the amount of drugs in the room as well. The one who went full blown crazy though did call back a month later to set up a payment plan to pay back the damages he caused in the room, which is issued by the court, so he gives the court the money and they write us a check and send it to us. 

To this day, nothing will ever compare what happened that night. I have been a front desk agent for three years, and when people ask what it's like to work in a hotel, I just sigh and tell them that story. There is no way to end this tale to be honest. It took ten cops 45 minutes to get a man on heroin, meth, and cocaine in cuffs. That is all I can think.1 man, 10 cop throw down",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Sooooo we just got a new little store put up in our lobby with sodas, sparkling water, snacks, and some travel essentials. I've had like a DOZEN guests walk over to the store and grab something and go to walk back to their rooms with out paying. And then I have to do the whole, ""SIR! Excuse me sir, you have to pay for that!"" thing. I'm mostly confused cause we have a pricing list on the counter next to all of the goodies and its really hard to miss. Also I've never stayed at a hotel that has a FREE snack section? Like I've gotten a snack checking into a hotel like a MILTON, but their pantry is not free. I'm just really confused cause they aren't like sketchy people obviously stealing there business dudes that I guess are too dumb to read a sign?

I guess this isn't really that big of a gripe but like how many of y'all experience this level of air-headedness at your hotel. I feel like its always the business travels that you think would be really smart but they lack ALL of the common sense...I'm confused, help??",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So another users' story reminded me of this doozy I had a few months ago.  
  
I was working the overnight security job, and it was just me and the night auditor. About 1200a or so, a girl comes into the lobby, but unbeknownst to her a misfit snuck in behind her. The looby door is locked after 11p, you have to swipe your key to get in, or get let in by the front deck clerk. Anyhow, we're focused on Ms. Sneaky here.  
  
She comes up to the front desk and claims she has a reservation. I cant remember the name, but the clerk looks it up and of course nothing comes up. She was nice enough at this point, but acting very very strange. She said ""OK thanks, I'll wait for my dad outside."" Ok. She walks outside.  
  
I continue doing my patrols, all is quiet. A couple of hours later, I notice that Ms. Sneaky is still sitting out at the firepit area. I engage, and ask her what her business is. She claims that she called her dad and is waiting for him, but she is in town for a funeral. Um ok, all details I don't care about. So the front desk clerk is having a smoke outside watching me figure out what is up with this weirdo. Ms. Sneaky walks up to the clerk who is smoking and non-chalantly asks, ""wheres my phone and wallet?"" As if the clerk has any effing idea. Clerk gives her a weird like WTF look and says, ""I have no idea."" I don't know if it was the questioning or what, but she decides it's time to leave. I watch her leave the property and just shake my head.  
  
Over the next hour I watch her wander from parking lot to parking lot. She even headed over to a neighboring hotel's lot. I called their security guard (who seems way less engaged than I) and tell her that she's got a bogey wandering her lot. She says OK and we finish the call. I don't know if she was run off from the neighboring hotel or what, but she comes heading back my way. Great.  
  
It's about 3a, and it dawns on me that this super suspicious figure I saw in the adjacent apartment buildings parking lot at around 11pm has got to be this weirdo. She's not on property again but shes across the drive, and she's talking to herself now. I've had enough, I have no idea if shes mental/emotional, on some sort of drugs, in some sort of danger, or what...so I call the five-oh to come figure this crap out. I'm getting off shift at 5a, and I dont want to stay over for paperwork reasons.  
  
I call 911 to do a welfare check on this lady. They come relatively quickly, and I see them as I am doing another exterior patrol and say 'good evening.' They didn't ask for any additional information from me, so I figured they understood the problem. I don't know what the final disposition was, but she wasn't there when I did my final patrol at about 445a.Hotel security: weird/drunk/high? lady sneaks in, tries to rent a room, and gets taken away by the fuzz",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I was working the night shift one night when an intoxicated guest showed up. She was around 30 years old and began to tell me she got in a fight with her mom and was kicked out. As she talked and slurred her words, I began to realize why she got in a fight. 

I asked her to scan her credit card. ""What does that even mean,"" she says. I ask again. ""I don't know what that means?"" I explain the process in excruciating detail. She yells back, ""you keep saying it but I don't know what that means!"" Finally, I say, you've got to go. I can't let you stay here. She calls me an asshole and leaves. 

About 10 minutes later, a guest comes up to me and tell me someone is screaming for help in the parking lot. I go outside and she's laying behind our bushes with a beer screaming, ""help me! Help me!"" I call 911 and tell them there's an intoxicated woman screaming for help at my hotel. The cops come and after some time, take her away. 

Later in the night, they come back to me and tell me she was so intoxicated that they took her to the hospital and the situation got a bit dire. They thanked me for calling. I was very happy she didn't drive when I sent her away.

A week later, the woman returns to our hotel and demands that we pay her hospital bills she accrued that night, that it was our fault she was taken to the hospital. We, of course, said no. She left saying, ""I'm going to get a lawyer and sue you!"" Of course, she never did.""What Does That Even Mean?""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Heyla guys, Im back with an update on what happened.   


First off, I appreciate y'alls responses on the matter that happened; Unfortunately, we at the FD level don't have access to turn off oversell but, normally, its never as crazy as it was on Saturday so we can usually handle it.   


I do plan on mentioning it to my GM when he gets back on Monday if nothing already has reached his ears about it.   


Now, as far as to what happened after my auditor kicked me out of the hotel for the night: According to him, more shenanigans happened. 

  
We had one more confirmed arrival that came in just as four more of these faxes came through to our hotel, all pre paid last minute and every single one of the people showed up. (Roughly, in the span of time....they must have sent about 10 or so of them)  


They went off on my poor auditor, they went off on the gentleman who was trying to check in...all demanding to know why the site was showing rooms, why we don't have rooms, why this guy has a room, etc etc. Thankfully he was able to fend them off and get them to call the 3rd parties to get their refunds. Afterwards, he managed to get ahold of our FoM about what happened and get that information passed to our hotel owner. (We have the stack of faxes as evidence just encase.)   


Around 6am, we actually received a call from the 3rd parties apologizing for what happened. My guess for that? Not only did they get chewed out by a dozen or so of their ""customers"", our owner must have gotten a hold of them and burned them for that. (The second part is not confirmed, only a hopeful guess of an FDA.)   


Cross fingers and knock on wood they don't try this again any time soon.""I don't have rooms"": The minor aftermath",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So our hotel has a restaurant that is inaccessible through the lobby. Working AM shifts I get the question ""Where is breakfast served?"" at least once for every checkout I have that day. My response is always the same.

""Our breakfast is served at our full service restaurant \[restaurant name here\], located out of our front door, and to the right.""

And the response is always the same.

""So we have to go out the front door?""

""Yes, and to the right.""

""So we have to go outside?""

""Yes, and to the right in order to enter our restaurant.""

""Can we go out that side door?""

""If you'd like, but that leads to the alley way, not the restaurant.""

""So we have to go outside?""

""YES. AND TO THE RIGHT.""

I've inquired tons of times with management about getting signs on the front door (located across from the elevator) that say something like ""your breakfast awaits just through these doors"" or something like that, which can direct people, but they say it's tacky.

I don't think it's any more tacky than having the same exact interaction 70 times per morning.Yes, going out the front door means going outside.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Basically tonight something in my brain snapped and was just like ‘this job isn’t fucking worth it’ I work at a chain motel and the area isn’t the worst but it’s also just barely one step up from the worst. So I’ve put up with a lot of bullshit. Having to go run tweakers off the property, get screamed at by drug addicts etc. etc. and occasionally we get guests who aren’t the normal clientele and they always compliment me and tell me I should be working somewhere better. My family and friends say the same thing. And I always blow it off, they pay me 25 cents above minimum wage here and jobs are scarce where I am. So it’s not ever bothered me too badly. And then tonight happens and it’s just like the straw that broke the camels back. First, the emergency alarm starts going off in the office and 911 is immediately calling. So I answer and I can’t tell what room the emergency is coming from and don’t really have anything to tell them so they just let me know that someone’s on the way and to call back if I find anything out in the meantime. So I get off the phone and lock up the cash drawers and go walking around the property to see if I can see anything. And immediately I look up and see an African American guy with his hood up trying a key card in several different doors, like saw him go up to one door try it, go to the door next to it try it, etc etc so I was like ah fuck here it is. He also had two little girls trailing behind him about 5/6 years old. I go back to the desk and call the non emergency number to let them know a room probably called because of this guy trying to get in. So then the guy comes down to the lobby, screaming even before he stepped foot in the lobby. I’m super nice and apologetic and trying to work out what’s going on but it doesn’t matter, I’m even giving this guy an out like oh if you just forgot your room number we can find it no biggie or whatever. Nah he’s just raging. He’s got tattoos under both of his eyes and a LIT BLUNT IN HIS HAND IN THE LOBBY WITH HIS KIDS. He ends up giving me a room number and it’s registered to a girl and no one else so I tell him sorry I can’t give you a key and he loses his shit. The cops end up showing up and he’s yelling and cussing so loud in the parking lot with them while the kids are just wandering around the lobby. I can hear him start telling the police that I’m lying on him and I’m a stupid little white bitch that has it out for him. Like if anything I tried way too hard to help him only because of the fact that he had young kids with him. It was just a giant shit show, the police are back and forth inside asking me questions, then the guy claims (like they always do) that he had spoken to out manager so they call my manager and of course she’s like nope never talked to the guy period, and she was the only one on shift before I came in. Just a load of bullshit and at some point he opens the door to the lobby and just starts staring me down like he’s disgusted and wants to kill me. So I said can I help you with the biggest fake smile I could give and he just smacks his teeth and starts staring even harder like he wants to hurt me, then he starts cussing and yelling at me again and I’m just taking it and he says something along the lines of and you’re doin too fuxkin much bitch and I said so sweetly, no sir I think you are and by then the police were pulling him back out of the lobby. It’s just not fucking worth it anymore I’m tired of this kind of crap every night I’m tired of getting yelled and cussed at and called names just because I’m following the rules. And I’m not even the strictest gsr believe it or not, I’m the most relaxed. But no I can’t take your food stamp card as a form of ID and all of a sudden I’m a dumb trash cunt. (different situation-just an example). So the police took a little longer with him trying to help him just like I did because he had kids with him but eventually they tell him he just needs to leave and they get him out of here. And then a few minutes later I get a call from a woman screaming and saying our beds have pee all over them and our floors are disgusting and she’s calling corporate and she demands to speak to a manager NOW and I know it’s a woman connected to this guy and I just wanted to fucking hang up on her so bad but we’re not allowed to. We have to take any abuse people throw at us and continue to smile and apologize. The whole thing is if the girl who’s name was on the folio was there I would’ve given her a key but instead I got some story about how she’s in Nevada and instant aggression etc. I can’t just issue some random person a key. And now I’m the bad guy. He also didn’t have ANY form of idea period and told me his name was Darren but told the police it was Eric? Idk man. Idk.

"Hi peeps!
I have this one particular *guest*, we'll just call her Slimy Karen (SK for the sake of my thumbs) who habitually books every spring for the National Softball Championships which is incidentally smack dab in the middle of peak season. EVERY TIME SK books 3 premium rooms for 6 nights, departs on the 5th night - her personal room only leaving the other 2 in house - due to *unsatisfactory conditions*. I am then slapped with a $2,000 relocation fee and spend the next 6 months fighting the fee. 

Last week saw her name for the 4th season in a row. I promptly and loudly exclaim, ""Oh Heeeeeeell No!"", cancel her reservation and have my Reservations Manager happily call the 3rd party to formally and clearly cancel all 3 rooms.

Slimy Karen calls raising ten kinds of hell but I could really give a shit. SK tells us how horrible and disgusting our hotel is, yet still wants to book the room....through the 3rd party. WTF?!? Ummmm... if it is so disgusting and horrible, why select our hotel year after year? There are literally dozens of hotels up and down the coastal area.

Last season I, again, sent in my multi-page dispute which was then turned over to a*nasty* collections attorney. This jack ass now calls my AP office repeatedly THREATENING my employee who just processes invoices. She has no authority whatsoever and is the sweetest girl - he brings her to tears with his threats and belligerent remarks.

I tell her not to acknowledge the debt and send the call to me....the Director of Finance. Guess who hangs up every time before allowing the call to be transferred? Yup. Jackass Attorney.

So, I would very much like to send my DNR list to all of the OTAs and 3rd party sites but can't get a straight answer on if this is possible.

Friends I started my hotel career on the front lines, right there with you. I have personally dealt with Slimy Karen and her spoiled brat of a teen. I am concerned I will lose all control and I may hurl my very old, very large and extremely outdated computer at her face if I have to deal with this shit another second.

Any ideas? Please help me avoid jail time and personal injury lawsuit that will most certainly follow.Both a question and a tale... Can a ""Do Not Rent"" list be passed on to a 3rd party booking company?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello! I’m here to tell you about a guest I have only see/heard from literally twice and I can confidently say I really dislike him! I have a lot of guests at my hotel (a small hotel named after a part in California that is part of a worldwide brand), but this one kind of takes up the most space in my mind lately because he called not to long ago so I regularly check to see if he’s got an incoming reservation.

He checks in on my evening shift, him and his wife. They’re fine, until they ask if we have complimentary bottles of water. A typical request, but no—we don’t. You may purchase one for 2.75$. It’s a steep price for a stupid bottle but hey, you’re paying for convenience.

He pulls this face somewhere between disappointment and sadness and grabs two, then says to me; “I should not have to pay, just because I forgot my bottle in the car” while staring at me. I laugh it off and ask if he’d like to pay card, cash, or room charge. But the entitlement doesn’t necessarily strike me as odd. He seemed like an obnoxious complainer so I wrote a note about him in my excel logbook.

It was the phone call that set me off completely on dreading ever seeing this human again.

He calls me up a few weeks later with a question: I’m on the app, but how do I know how many rewards points it takes to stay at a hotel?

Easy, look at the individual hotel you’re trying to stay at in the app and it should tell you. I don’t have the app in front of me, and phones are prohibited so I start rapidly googling pictures of the app to better assist him. He doesn’t get it, and we keep repeating ourselves until he hits me with this kernel. I’m not sure if he things he’s got customer service workers figured out and thinks he’s gonna just...I dunno, crlt+alt+delete and use the magic password, but he says: I’m the customer, I DEMAND to know how to find out! You cannot withhold this information from me!

I take a pause, kind of like...dude, it’s really not that serious? I assure him he doesn’t have to worry, that I’ll assist him if he’ll hold. Cue a long painful sigh typically reserved for men on their deathbeds. I call over my manager who’s on staff with me and ask how I can help a guest find a category-to-points chart or the like. Manager pulls out his phone and says he can find it literally in front of him.

I explain this guest is irate and unhappy with me currently, so I ask to please borrow the phone with the app. Once I give him directions to find it he just sighs and hangs up. Good riddance.

It’s not as bad as other stories on here, but I’m not sure if he’s a points farmer, or really just an asshole, but I’ve been regularly checking to see if he’s gonna stay with us again. I have weird guests, but it’s actually pretty rare I have rude guests. He just has that pathetic kind of simpering rudeness that I loathe in people. If you’re gonna be rude, don’t try and make me sympathetic.This guest has only stayed with us twice, and I can confidently say I dislike him",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"If you have read some of my last couple posts you would understand that the hotel I work at is outdated to hell and has awful ownership (Yes, I am trying to leave), so with that being said one of our hot water heaters has been broken for the past couple of months and no one seems to be in a hurry to get it fixed. Usually this isn't an issue through the week because the remaining water heaters are able to keep up with everything.

Well this wasn't during the week, and we are ass-to-ass slammed with multiple sports teams.

I have had countless of complaints throughout the weekend about some rooms not being able get hot water because of our occupancy and the fact that everyone is showering at the exact same time. Of course guests are pissed off, and as they should be.

Now the majority of people understand that it isn't my fault, they get that I have no control over how the hot water works and so on. They understand that I am just a lonely front desk mule that is underpaid and overworked. (Well I like to think they understand). 

I'd also like to take this time that there is no manager on duty during the weekends and they also have no desire to come in when shit hits the fan. 

Well with every 10 apples there are about 2 rotten ones in the bunch that just really grind my gears. Usually I'm pretty good with damage control, but unfortunately I didn't even get a chance with this guy.

Angry guest=AG, Me=Me (duh)

AG comes down with his wife and daughter to check out, he hands me the room keys and before I can even go into my ""have a good rest of the day"" speech he lets me know about his woes.

**AG:** We are checking out and there was no hot water from 8am-10am.

**ME:** I'm sorry sir, I understand your frustration and--

Then AG proceeds to point his finger right in my face, crossing the front desk line. So I am not caught off guard. While he is doing this his wife is standing right behind him, arms crossed, face in a mixture of a smirk and scowl, and nodding her head to his every word just like a true Karen.

**AG:** I do not appreciate that at all! You should have told me there would be no hot water! I can't believe that you are just going to stand there and not do anything about this. I will be calling corporate about this and you will be in for it.

Then AG and his bitchy wife walk off into the sunset (sunrise or high noon?) not giving me a chance to offer them all the free things, including a comped stay if it came to that.

Like I get it, it sucks that you didn't have hot water trust me I would be pissed too, but why the hell do you have to bitch and moan to someone who has no control over the issue (let alone not giving said person a chance to make things a little better). I can't just be like ""Oh WOW I am sooooo sorry. Here let me wrinkle my nose and put my thumb in my ass to magically make the hot water start working again"". I mean that's like getting pissed at a cat for not barking.

Also don't point and wiggle your finger in my face, I could have bitten it off. 

Anyways thanks for reading.Oh hot water Gods, be with me",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Heyla guys, I hope everyone is having a good Saturday so far.   


Now this actually happened last night and I am finally mentally calm enough to put keyboard to webpage without wanting to rip faxes to pieces/sending said equipment flying across our lobby.   


As I have mentioned once or twice before: Third Party Sites have been known to send our hotel property reservation information without actually putting it in our system which leaves us FDAs to do it manually via fax. Its fine if we can catch it fast enough but on busy nights where we don't always hear the fax machine go off. So we have had missed a paper or two until the guest actually comes in and lets us know they have a reservation.   


Now, as most of you may know, some of the third parties don't give a hoot about the actual staff going mental!   


Example being last night:   
Last weekend of the Stockshow and we sold out fairly quickly, well before 3pm. Some reservations come by phone, by website and a few popped up by fax.   


...And they just kept coming, even when my system said ""NO VACANCY"". The faxes with Pre-Paid, last-minute reservations came in for rooms I did not have.   


I had to explain to several people last night (and feeling horrid while doing so) that whoever they got the room from had sold them something that did not exist. I would be willing to vouch for a refund but they would have to call them to get it processed.   


Even while I was doing this and shuffling my normal chores, the faxes kept coming.   


It finally got to the point where one of the agents with the 3rd called the front desk to verify that I could not get a room for one of these guests. When I mentioned that I had no rooms and they forced it through, they had the balls to actually say: ""Well your hotel is going to be charged a relocation fee of XXX dollars if you cannot accommodate this guest. You don't have an upgraded room you can move them to?""  


Guys, I exploded in the softest way possible. (My Customer service mask dropped and I had to squeeze the phone to keep from swearing worse then a sailor at these people.)   


I told them point blank: I have no rooms, your system is showing incorrect information, you keep pushing through rooms even though I had told several of your colleagues I have NOTHING, You are charging these people for something I don't have! YOU RELOCATE THEM! BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED FOR THIS!   


My auditor who came in that evening could see the steam pouring out of my ears. Bless him, he bounced behind the desk and helped me with a few more of the guests that came in before I sat down in the back to cool down.   


ARGH!""Our system is showing you have rooms""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We are in the Kids Hockey Season, and we've had some doozies for teams. One of my favorites from this year has to be when someone left their door WIDE open all day. 

I was the Supervisor on Duty one Saturday night, and we had a particularly bad batch of teams in house. I was doing regular floor checks because the little sh\*ts kept running up and down the halls, and I came across a room on the 5th floor with their door wide open, not propped open on the latch, but completely open, I think they wedged a T-shirt on the floor to keep it open. 

I walked by it a couple times and didn't close it, thinking they might be right back. But by 10pm I closed it and came back to the desk. 

A lady came down and said she needed a new key because ""I think Security closed my door"". I piped up and said ""No I closed it because keeping it open is a safety concern"". She looked at me and was like ""well, that wasn't your decision to make! I kept it open on purpose!"" so I explained again about safety, and that ""we wouldn't want your things to get stolen"". 

Lady: ""I always keep my doors open! I don't lock my house, I leave the keys in the truck, so that wasn't your choice to make!"" 

I didn't argue any further. Have fun getting robbed next time.""That wasn't your choice to make!""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Reading another post recently about hell guests, reminded me of a old, old complaint I had. I think some of you know where this is going already... 

Work at a extended stay hotel that closes the office at night. Had a guest with no reservation show up at 2 AM trying to get a room. This guest was a 20 something young girl, by herself, who was apparently dropped off at the hotel.

CG = Crazy Girl. Me = Me. CGF = Friend

So anyways, the on call phone rings.

Me: Thank you for calling blah blah blah.

CG: I need a room. My friend is going to pay for it. Can he pay over the phone?

Me: No, unfortunately we cannot take payment over the phone as it is not in PCI compliance. He would need to be physically present, or fill out a third party authorization and we do not take those outside of office hours.

CG: I bet if I was black you would help me.

Me: Excuse me?

CG: If I was another *Very derogatory word* you would take it. You *Same derogatory word*'s don't help anyone but your own kind.

Important to note at this point that I am white. 

Me: Ma'am, I don't appreciate the racist language you are using. I am trying to help you. We don't normally take cash after hours, but i'll even make a exception for you.

CG: You aren't hearing me you stupid *You guessed it*. I don't have any money. My friend is going to pay for the room. He isn't here. He just dropped me off.

Me: Is it possible for him to come back? It would only take a few minutes to check you in!

CG: You worthless piece of shit. If he could come back, he wouldn't need to pay over the phone now would he?

Me: No ma'am, I guess not. Unfortunately I don't have any other options available here to help you. 

At this point CG goes off on probably the most racist rant I have ever heard. Straight up klan level stuff. I cut her off about a minute in.

Me: Ma'am, due to your continued abuse and racist language, I am going to refuse to check you in. You need to leave the property immediately. I then hang up.

About 10 minutes later I get a call from the friend who was going to pay for the room for her... 

CGF: Yeah, my friend is trying to get a room at the hotel.

Me: Sorry sir, due to her continued racist language and abuse towards me personally, I am refusing to check her in. 

CGF: What do you mean racist language?

Me: She has repeatedly called me racial slurs. I lost count of how many times she used the N word.

CGF: .... Well, I mean... Are you even black?

Gotta be one of the dumbest things I have heard over the years.

Me: Yes sir. I am.

CGF: You don't sound black.

Me: What does a black person sound like sir?

CGF: .... I don't know. You know what I mean.

Me: No sir, I don't. I am not going to check her in. I am sorry for any problems this has caused, but nothing will change that.

CGF: Well... Ok I guess.


Now... The next morning I get called in to talk about the complaint that was filed against me. The guest claimed that I was racist, rude, unprofessional, and told her that I don't care where she went, and that I hoped she got raped in the parking lot.

I obviously told my side of the story, but, as this was a extremely serious complaint, I would have a conference call with HR, as well as several high level management positions in the afternoon. 

Thing is, I knew the calls were recorded. My Manager knew the calls were recorded. We don't have access to them at the hotel level. This was early into my employment at the company so I wasn't as well known as I am now ( Now, they probably wouldn't even talk to me at all if a complaint like this came though, partially because of what happened next ).

Conference call time!

Generic disclaimers, explaining of the complaint, how this can lead to termination, etc. I went along with everything they said. Stated that they would play the recording before giving me a chance to defend myself.

Thing is... None of them actually listened to the recording before the conference call.

I can only describe the ensuing awkward silence as a thing of absolute beauty. It was one of those things that radically changes a persons perspective so fast they don't even really know how to process it.

The first thing I hear after about 30 seconds of the call being over...

Management:  That... Ok then.... I apologize for making you go through all this Ninjiitsu, but I hope you understand how we need to take complaints like this seriously.

Me: I completely understand. No worries!

So a guest checked out yesterday, and when housekeeping went into their room later they found a laptop and charger left behind. We managed to contact the guest, who was thankfully still in town, and she said she would stop by in the morning to pick them up.

Cue the ungratefulness. UG = Ungrateful Guest

Me: Hi, how may I help you?

UG: Hi, I'm UG, I'm here to pick up the laptop and charger I left here.

Me: \*confirms ID\* Absolutely, let me grab that for you!

I bring the laptop and charger to the desk and hand them to her

UG: \*scoffs\* there wasn't a laptop bag with it???

Me: Uhm, no ... this is all we found in the room.

UG: Well how am I supposed to carry this around without a bag?

Me: I'm not sure, sorry about that ma'am.

She turns around and storms out without even so much as a thank you. Why are people like this? We go out of our way to do something nice and she acts like we just inconvenienced HER. Ugh.Ungrateful guest is mad when we return her lost laptop",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Not ny story, but a fun one told to me years ago by a bellhop at the class of hotel military brass with unlimited budgets stay.

The hotel was packed to the gills with officers in town for some event or another. Pecking orders were strictly enforced.

The bellhop was coming down from an upper floor in a fairly full elevator when it stopped on a floor, doors opening to reveal a young officer who commanded ""everybody out, Major General (2 stars) Pikachu needs to get on."" Before anybody could move a loud voice bellowed out ""to hell with that two star!""

The ranks in the elevator pushed to the sides to reveal Lt General (3 stars) Squirtle at the back of the cab.

Not another word was spoken as the doors closed and the elevator continued on its merry way.Rank has its privileges. Up to a point.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Had a super odd call this evening. Excuse my formatting, I haven't posted to Reddit in a long time (besides comments).

I'm the front desk supervisor for our downtown property, and I am assigned the MOD shift for Fridays and Saturdays. Love me some people watching.

Let me set the scene. Its been dead. We had 22 arrivals at 3PM and 2 at 8PM. I sent my other agent home around this time because we had not had a single phone call, or request, or anything for 2 hours straight. She wanted to head out early, and I said I'd join her later for drinks (Front desk team is celebrating an agents birthday, so I'll be the last to arrive). Yes I poured one out for my audit homies. I know the struggle.

8:45PM rolls around and I get a phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

*Me = Me | AC= Angry Caller*

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** ""Thank you for calling *property* my name is ""Me"", how may I assist you?""

**AC:** ""Yeah I need to speak to a manager. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately know how this is gonna go. We all do...

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** ""That would be me sir, I am the manager on duty. What can I do for you?""

**AC:** ""Well me and my wife have been driving for 400 miles and I just got our of surgery yesterday, and we were tired and wanted to stop for a bite to eat and to rest, but when my wife tried to make a reservation she was asked all this personal information like her email and phone number, and what property she stayed at last, and I (he starts yelling) WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THAT""

&amp;#x200B;

I was very confused to say the least. Why are you in the card after surgery? I am alone who did you speak to? I sent my agent home almost an hour ago, and hadn't taken any phone calls until then.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** ""Do you know who you spoke to sir?""

**AC:** ""NO I DONT, it was some girl"". He then repeats the **EXACT SAME** rant as before, and yells again: ""WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THAT!?!?""

**Me:** ""Sir I am sorry, but I have been the only person at the desk, and I am the only front desk staff on property, are you sure you called the right property? (We have 12 *Brand* hotels and 3 properties sharing the same property name) We have multiple locations here in the city. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Now I hear him talking to his wife, and he gives us our phone number and address. Definitely us! I know my agents are some of the nicest people on the planet and I know 100% that last question is not something we ask.

&amp;#x200B;

**AC:** ""We called you and now we are headed to *town 110 miles away* because we couldn't stay with you. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THAT!!?!??""

**Me:** ""Sir I have been the only person on the desk for the past hour, and I have not answered a single phone call-""

**AC (Cutting me off)**: ""Well that is some bullshit because you are not a girl and I definitely spoke to a girl. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THIS!?!""

**Me:** ""I am sorry sir but there isn't anything I can do to assist you besides make a reservation-""

**AC** **(Cutting me off again)**: ""This is bullshit, you wont help me and your staff is rude. I am contacting corporate.""

**Me:** ""You are more then welcome to sir, their number is (support line) and they will be able to assist you further. Is there anything else I can do to assist you here on property?""

**AC:** ""No, you are not helpful""

**Me**: ""Then have a wonderful night sir""

*Click*

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 100% sure he and his wife were trying to answer security questions at central reservations, and are paranoid and hung up. OR he was trying to scare me into giving him a free room.

&amp;#x200B;

This stuff doesn't even phase me anymore. I have been working the desk for 2 years, and I feel like I have seen it all.

I'll post an update if he contacts support, since I am the first one to screen these reports :).

"I work in a kind of small hotel, 74 rooms. Our hotel has superior rooms and they're twin and double, of course.  Twin rooms are a bit cheaper because people want them less.

So, person books a twin room and asks for the beds to be together. I check our availability and, sure enough, 10 and more, usually double rooms available.

I message them telling that if they want a double room they can book a double room as we have them available for their dates. They usually message us back ''can't you just do it?''. 

5€ isn't that much, just book the damn double.

"This happened last night. I was on the Night Audit shift and just after 4 AM I decided to go use the bathroom before starting cooking our hot breakfast.

I leave the bathroom and head to the kitchen, since it's very rare that anyone is waiting at the front desk that I am not expecting. Plus I have to walk past the front desk/into the lobby anyway to get to the kitchen.

Anyway, there was this guy playing with our cereal dispenser. I was like ""okay, guest got up early for a cold breakfast, whatever"", I put the cold stuff out as soon as I get in for NA, because of the railway crews coming and going at weird times and they usually miss our complimentary breakfast if I put everything out closer to 5 AM. So, I say hello as I approached the kitchen and was about to say I could make him some bacon and scrambled eggs if he wanted something hot if he waited 5 minutes.

Well, he wasn't a guest or working for the 2 railroad companies we usually host. He was a drunk that wandered in well I was using the public bathroom.

DG= Drunk Guy       Me= Me

Me: Good morning, sir!

DG: Yeah, whatever, you got a room?

(We aren't supposed to check in people after 3 AM, a weird rule my GM decided we need. Plus we were almost a full house.)

Me: Uh, let me go check if we have any availability.

*turns to walk back to the front desk*

DG: Or would you rather I drive drunk?

Me: Um, no, sir. I just need to see if we have anything available.

Me: Have you stayed with us before?

DG: No, I usually drive by. Place looks fancy.

Me: Yes, we are a 4 star hotel sir. (Gives property benefits as standard to all new clients) the best available rate for today is $165 for a standard 2 queen bedroom.

DG: Yeah, whatever.

Me: Alright, may I see your ID and the card you'll be paying with?

DG: Debit?

Me: No, I need a Credit Card. (Another weird GM decision, not mine.)

*DG annoyingly hands me his ID and CC and glances around weirdly*

DG: Kind of fucking expensive for a drunk guy, isn't it? What if I walked out of here and drove drunk tonight? What would you do?

Me: I would inform the local police there was a drunk driver on the road. Here's your registration sir. Please fill out your vehicle information and sign here and initial at the bottom.

DG: I don't have a car, I wouldn't be filling that out.

Me: Okay, I just need you to sign and initial then. Here you go. *Places automated teller with DG's card inserted to pay for his room.*

DG: This is pretty expensive for a drunk driver, ya know?

Me: Yes, we are a 4 star hotel sir at almost full capacity. *Takes back auto teller*, You'll get your receipt with a detailed copy at the end of your stay. Here's your key, you are room 512.

DG: My receipt.

Me: Yes, you'll get it with a deta-

DG: Give it to me. Now.

(I can see he's starting to get aggressive with me. Plus he had leaned over the counter obviously trying to intimidate me with his height. I'm 5'9"" and wearing heels, it wasn't obvious until he started being hostile. He was like 6'2"".)

Me: Uh, okay? *prints out duplicate receipt*

DG: *To our security camera above me, yelling* It would be great if this place had a fucking taxi! You know for DRUNK DRIVERS!

(Our cameras dosen't record audio and I am the only staff on the property. My GM usually comes in at 9 AM during weekdays. This was the weekend. And we have the town's Taxi Cab service listed at front desk in big obvious letters on our local services poster.)

Me: Um, sir, there is a taxi service. Do you want me to call them?

DG: * Just stares*

Me: Is there... anything else I can do for you?

DG: My room, what room am I in?

Me: 512, I wrote it on your key, sir.

DG: *Leaves front desk to head for elevator, starts yelling at camera in hallway* No taxi, your fucking lucky I had money!

I watch him on the security cameras until he goes into his room. Then I finally can go get breakfast started.

btw, I used to work as a barmaid/bouncer (jokingly called a Tavern Wench by regulars, because the place was named the (insert town name) Tavern and we had a pirate theme), so I am used to dealing with ""drunk logic"" and not showing fear towards aggressive behaviour. This guy would have been taken away by police if he tried anything beyond yelling at cameras and aggressively asking for a receipt. Plus, I knew he just needed a room to pass out in until he was sober anyway, it was the beer talking to him.Pretty expensive for a drunk driver, ya know?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hoooo boy, this will be a long one. SO. We have a local mental health facility that comes down every now and then to house their clients while they search for permanent housing. Nothing major happens, the occasional removal from the property, but nothing to write home about. 

Cue to last Wednesday.  The mental health facility comes in with one of their clients who is a young war veteran. Very polite, he asked me what my favorite color was because he saw my nails were blue. I get them all squared away, and the facility people leave while the guy stays behind (we will call him D). D stares at the wall next to me so I  can still see half of his face. He starts by saying something along the lines of, ""I know you know where my room is. You're the most beautiful girl I have ever seen"". I think he did this so it wouldn't look like he was actually talking to me. At that point, I was creeped the fuck out so I tiptoe into the back office without him seeing and lock the door. He continues to ""talk to me"" but I ignore him. He leaves.

I had gone across the parking lot to start laundry for about 5 minutes. While I was gone, my manager said that D had asked specifically where I was. Manager told him that I was working and to leave me alone. I came back to the office and was watching the security cameras as he left his room and walked the exact same path I had just walked, stopped, and started to look around. He continued to do this about three times. 

D comes down a short time later to tell me his shower isn't working. Usually I am willing to help people out personally if its small issues like that, but I had a weird feeling. When you walk in the rooms, there is a large room with the bed, and then a much smaller space in the back with the bathroom. He could easily corner me if he wanted to. So I told him the maintenance guy would be right up. I  went into the back office again and shut the door while he sat to wait for the maintenance guy. D started singing at the top of his lungs for two straight minutes and then left. 

At this point, I had already told my manager and her husband (the maintenance guy) about how he was creeping me out, so they were keeping watch. Maintenance guy goes to check his shower. It's working fine. D comes back 2 minutes later, his shower isn't running hot water. Maintenance goes up, nothing wrong. This happens, I shit you not, 5 times before the maintenance guy tells D, ""You better stay in your room."" And I could tell he was getting pissed off. 

Now my manager has taken hold of the desk and told me stay in the back office. D comes down again and asks my manager to send me up to his room. Yeah. Fuck the shower, just send me up. She went OFF. 

""D, get back to your room now! If you don't go back to your room, I will call the police!"" She gave him a good 3 minutes to leave, but he didn't. So she called the police. While she was on the phone, he started talking about Adam and Eve, and how I was Eve, and how Jesus will soon visit, and the cops won't help, etc. My manager was explaining to the 911 operator how he said his shower wouldn't work but it does, and D said, "" It still doesn't work, it will never work until she comes up there."" I have a recording of it. It gives me the chills listening to it. 

Anyways. Cops come, talk to him, talk to me, decide he is fine so he stays. Which made me extremely uncomfortable, because I was glued to the security cameras the entire day terrified, but if he left his room to talk to me, I was to call the cops immediately. 

I leave for the day, come back in the morning to the shitshow that ensued that early morning. My manager informs me that at 6am, D started throwing shit off of the balcony; clothes, towels, etc. D had  then locked himself in the bathroom, turned on the shower and flooded his ENTIRE room and the room below him, yelling about how he was washing his sins away. Manager called the cops and they finally took him away. We will have to replace the entire floor in those two rooms, as well as possibly parts of the ceiling where the water poured out. A guest in the room under him that flooded had also informed us that D had thrown his toenail clippers off the balcony as well, and broke the poor man's windshield. So add that to the long list of damages.

So that concludes the single day tirade of D. I need a nap after that. 

P.S. I know this guy had some severe mental problems, probably relating to being a veteran. I truly feel bad for him and really hope he gets the help he needs.The day in which I was requested to accompany someone in their room... but it's worse than that.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It's been a fun couple days here answering the phones.  You see, apparently there was a big basketball tournament scheduled for this weekend, but due to some storms rolling through, the tournament was cancelled at the last minute.  I find it kind of baffling that they would cancel an indoor sport due to rain, but I digress.  Word of the cancellation must have gone out late Thursday or Friday, because that's when the phones started ringing.  People who had booked rooms for the weekend were calling left and right to cancel their reservations.

The problem is, most of these people had booked our advance purchase, non-refundable rates, because those are generally the cheapest rates we offer.  So one call after another it was ""I'm sorry, but the rate you booked is non-refundable.  You agreed to these terms when you reserved the room.""  Of course, NO ONE saw ANYTHING on their reservation to that effect.  Their eyes must have passed right over the big, bold ""**non-refundable**"" that was right there next to the rate that they clicked.  Either that, or they think that they're a special exception, because surely ""non-refundable"" means ""non-refundable unless I tell you why I'm cancelling"".  

Honestly I wish our hotel would just stop offering these rates, because it seems like more trouble than it's worth, and most of the ones that get escalated to a manager get refunded anyway.  All it does is create a headache when people inevitably want to cancel.What do you think ""non-refundable"" means?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Has anyone had any issues with guests making pre-paid reservations on uncommon websites that are actually scams?

We got a reservation from a site, something about beds in hotels.

Guest has already paid this website months ago when they first made the reservation.

Now they want to check in and the virtual card is declined.  They insist that it was paid for already and I'm trying to explain to them how pre-paid reservations work.  They never actually paid us, they paid a company that is supposed to provide us with payment.

They are old and just don't get it.  I wish there was something I could do, but they really need to talk to their bank and try to go after this company to get money back, but from looking at this sites reviews on BBB, they aren't going to have much luck.Scam Booking Websites",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is an awkward position to be in at the front desk of a hotel. I have seen so many things in my years. One time a thirtyish year old woman came in with her mom.
Her mom was pretty much holding her up in her arms, she was in such a sad state she couldn’t walk with out support. 
She said that there was a charge on their credit card for the hotel and that she wanted to confirm her husband used his card at our hotel. I was happy as hell to help (not that I want to see a women be broken in front of me but to be like ‘I got your back girl’ thing) normally I would not be able to give any information because of the privacy shit but his dumb ass used the credit card. I looked it up with the card and sure enough the guy used it the night he said he was out of town (he lived near by). She then tried to get more information, I didn’t remember anything and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t allowed to anyways. Maybe he just needed a night away from her? It seemed like he was up to no good though from the looks of it. I saw in her eyes that I just confirmed something. 

Another thing is long time guests, I had a guest that stayed during the week and would go home on weekends. His wife would call the hotel to be transferred to his room and I would send her call up and when it rang back down to me after he didn’t answer she would badger me about if he was at the hotel bar. I kindly said I couldn’t give out guest information. I knew he was there I felt bad that I couldn’t say anything. I also saw him kissing another long time female guest that stayed during the week as well. One day I was walking down the hall, saw them kissing, and Instead of walking the other directing My awkward ass said, hi guys! The look on their faces was a sight to see.

"Unfortunately, closure doesn't always mean justice.

However, two weeks ago, I thought I'd be fired after I let some soft-spoken boy convince me that ""pending"" authorization would go through. Yeah, my mistake. I wasn't thinking. There's no excuse, I think my job still exists out of the company's desperation. Not only did his card decline for his $500+ stay, he did very illegal drugs in the room and stole the fucking T.V. The massive flat screen we have in all of our suites.

I should have been fired. I felt horrible, it was nearly 2k of damages. No payment. I tried to correct myself and contact his employer, obviously was a lie. Not only did he not work with that airline, the assistant I spoke with kept laughing (seriously, uncalled for). I just couldn't believe such a smooth, soft, slightly-southern-feminine voice would belong to such a foul person.

I recognized it the second I answered the phone today. He's asking for a suite, three nights, just like last time.

He asked if we had rooms for check in today, I knew he wanted to check in *now* but fumbled around that detail on the mere chance he'd actually show up to check in. I didn't think he would.

I was so sure at some point he'd think checking into the hotel he stole the damn T.V. from would be a bad idea. But there was a chance!!! I was freaking out, called my boss at 5am to ask her what I could do for payment, she told me what to do.

He showed up. And kindly presented his ID, and said ""I've stayed with you before, I think you have my name wrong in my system.""

He pulls out his card. His ID matches the reservation from before.

""I'm sorry sir,"" I say, ""It seems like we have an outstanding balance.""

""What?!""

That gentle voice was still convincing.

""$500 from your last stay, it seems."" the starting amount.

""What?! I had no idea, I never got that email! My card never declines!""

""I'm sorry, but it's there.""

""Who can I talk to, to fix this?""

It's getting hard to keep firm.

""My manager. She gets in around noon.""

""So I can't check in?""

""Not without payment.""

""I never got that email saying-""

""Our system doesn't send out emails about declined cards.""

""I never got an email, I had no idea, it never declines,"" He puts his phone to his ear, ""Let me step outside and call them real quick.""

I'd already accepted that he was gone. Few people ever just ""step outside"" for a phone call, not in the middle of freezing rain. He stepped out as normal as ever, rounded the corner, and left forever.

No payment. I couldn't make up for what I did to this property. But I was able to confront him a final time, and I learned my lesson. I'm proud, I feel like a mile high. Nothing happened, and I didn't change what I'd done, but I feel a bit better...Closure on a Scammer",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm on mobile so sorry for the formatting.

Little background. I've been at this hotel for 6 years now. Smaller hotel at 79 rooms. We were within the YHG brand and the remodeling costs would have built us a new hotel so our owners decided to switch us to a Yoice brand hotel. All fine and dandy until the day of system switch.

We changed in January and the day we switched was very interesting. I worked a swing shift from 8am to 4pm. When I left at 5, not everything was completed. Only one front desk computer was working and we couldn't get CCs to go through. Our fix was to run it off a Hotspot. Yes, we were running the front desk off of a hotspot. Only one computer though, the other one stayed on the old network so we could print. We checked people in on one and printed everything off the other. We had to run it this way till our new internet circuit was put in. 

On a different 9 to 5 shift, the day after the new  circuit was put in. In my 8 hours I got one thing done and that was deciding we needed a 24 port unmanaged switch. So we get one shipped out to us and I spent a few hours on that while my AGM watched the desk. I got the interface server working and that was it. 

I come in on a midnight shift and was able to find what ports for the 2 front desk computer, the 2 office printers, and the managers computers. Only took a few hours. Everything was working fine until today. YHG turned off the access to their equipment and it killed the internet at the front desk. We still are uncertain why, specially since we were on a totally different network. So, back to working off the hotspot. After 5ish hours we got it back up and running. Weirdly the computers needed to be fully unplugged and plugged back in since restarting or shutting down Windows 10 doesn't clear old internet settings.

Monday we start remodeling the lobby.

YHG was no help and neither was Yoice. If anyone here has to switch brands, I hope you don't have nightmare internet issues as I've had. But now we have a network map for our office.Brand Switching Nightmares.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"Around 2 AM this couple walk in and ask to check in. I go through my whole thing and get them checked in. The woman was acting a little weird and gave off a strange vibe but I figured it was just late and she was drunk. She definitely seemed like the controlling one right off the bat. They had no belongings with them and had that vibe of a couple who’d just met that night. I give them the keys and send them on their way. It’s pretty dead tonight so I’m just chilling at the desk playing games on my phone. About 20-30 minutes after I get them checked in I hear the elevator ding and that same couple gets off the elevator so I pause my game real quick in case they need any help. They walk right past me and towards the couches at first and I heard them mention food but they don’t approach me so I assume they're fine. Then the guy comes up to the desk and asks if I have an iPhone charger. I tell him I don’t (I do but guests never give that shit back) and he walks away and they seem like they’re going to leave. 

I start to go back to my game and then I hear her snap her fingers and say to him “uh uh, come back here just one minute” and then she comes up to me and asks if I have a charger. At that moment I start getting real Tammy II from Parks &amp; Rec vibes. I quickly glance back up at her and again say no and she immediately responds ""you need to get off your fucking phone and pay attention to us!"" I was startled at first and then I apologize, tell her I was in fact listening to her, and once again repeated that I didn’t have a charger. She proceeds to complain about the fact that we don’t have a phone charging station in the lobby and says that I need to tell our owners to ""get on that"". They ask where they can get a charger and a food and I tell them about a 24 hour drug store down the street. After giving them directions she asks if I can call them a car. By this point I'm thinking ""is this lady fucking serious?"" I tell her that I can call them a cab but that's it. ""You mean you can't order us a Lyft or anything???"" I again say no, we don't have a company card or anything to charge those to and there's no way I'm paying for their ride out of pocket. She doesn't like that at all and says ""it's the 21st century, you guys need to get with the fucking times! You need to tell your bosses to get on that too!"" and storms out. As they're leaving the guy turns gives me a look any guy would recognize. The ""dear god please help me this lady is crazy"" look. He must've lingered too long because I hear her snap again to get him to come outside. 

A few minutes pass and the front door opens. This time it's just him. He walks up to the desk and the first words out of his mouth are ""This chick is fucking nuts man!"" He proceeds to tell me all about his night. He's here for a few days on business and they met at a bar and instantly hit it off. They're making out at the bar, he's feeling it, etc. and he gets them a ride back to his hotel. They get there and she isn't satisfied with the place. She demands they go back out drinking and later makes him get them a room somewhere nicer than where he's staying. She says to book a room at The Bearaton. So he does that and he tells me that on the way here from his hotel she starts being real hot &amp; cold towards him and was all up &amp; down with her emotions. After I checked them in they go up to the room and she starts giving him a strip tease (props to this guy for not sparing any details and making this boring night a little more entertaining for me). However, he had just broken up with his girlfriend a couple weeks ago and realizes he's not over her and he's not into is and asks her to stop. That's when they came down looking to get some food. 

After they go outside to get a ride he tells her something along the lines of ""it's not working"" and sends her home. So now he's at my desk recounting his crazy night. I let him use my charger to charge his phone up to call himself a ride back to his hotel. While he's waiting he shares whats been going on in his life recently, how he still wasn't over his ex, all these uneasy feelings he has inside, how he felt bad hooking up with another woman, the works. I feel really bad for him because he's just here on business and happened into some crazy at the bar. I fully refund him for the room to try to make his night a little less sour and tell him to come stay with us next time he's in town for business and I'd hook him up. He seemed really appreciative and a little emotional - probably from the alcohol - and gives me a big ole hug before going outside to catch his ride.""This chick is fucking nuts man!""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Our urinal was out for about 12 hours last week and in that time, 3 different times we had to change the sign because grown ass men kept peeing on it. THREE. TIMES. All within 12 hours. We had a wet floor sign in front of it AND a sign directly over it. The worst part was, it just pooled in the bowl because it was broken so the whole bathroom stank. After the 3rd time, we had to put a trash bag over the entire urinal.

Absolutely ridiculous. And I know it wasnt children because it was in the middle of the week so most of our guests were corporate travelersGrow men peeing on out of order sign",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey TalesFromTheFrontDesk

I'm back again to close out the story of the family I posted about [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/e3o06k/three_little_terrors/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/e5ahi0/three_little_terrors_brief_update/).
Firstly and most importantly, the family is GONE as of a week now. I am FREE. I may or may not have been listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk8mm1Qmt-Y) on repeat for the past week. Now gather round for the terror they inflicted upon us humble desk workers for three months. 


I shared the advice I received in the first thread with my coworkers, including my FOM. We were all in agreement, but no one was really taking action until one day when I came in after a crappy night's sleep, decided I didn't want an entire 2nd shift of Roblox noises and shrieking/swearing, and disconnected the router cables for our business center in our server room. I put on my best acting of 'gosh I don't know what could have *possibly* gone wrong there, I don't know anything about computers!' when the dad came by to ask about them. The eldest kid waited in the lobby *all night* waiting for them to be 'fixed', but it was just him and he did it quietly, so I had a peaceful shift for once.


Word spread and my first shift coworker put up a sign on each computer stating they're out of order, and that the desk can handle any printing/scanning needs for guests. We were determined to hold out until their original checkout date--this happened around new year's, and they were due out within a week. 


They were in a constant battle with their insurance company to extend however, and so I got to meet the mother for the first time. By meet, I mean she came up to the desk as if she needed something, then whipped out her phone, and proceeded to scream and curse at the insurance company while maintaining full eye contact with me the entire time. [MFW](https://media0.giphy.com/media/C8uzdnRrT8OsF8OCYH/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611388c8e8dd613d4d52a781a883490fc7cdcef327f&amp;rid=giphy.gif). 


She got off the phone, asked 'Was I too mean? Or not mean enough?' and I made some vague sounds in my throat intended as a noncomittal answer. She was angry because they wouldn't cover a second room for the family, and was determined to sue them. Now bear in mind the family had a room with two queen beds and a pullout couch, so the insurance's company logic was probably - adult couple shares one bed, then with three boys ranging in age from 6 y.o to 12, two of them could share one large bed. What the insurance company wasn't accounting for was the parent's relationship. 


Up until that point, mom had been choosing to stay in their *burned* house rather than be around the dad. And we got to witness multiple instances of the mom hanging out in the lobby, on the phone with the dad who was up in the room, saying things like 'I fucking hate you', 'You piece of shit/bastard/etc' and witnessed by my first shift- 'I'll just go home and *kill myself*'. On one occasion she did this song and dance in the lobby in front of me and *one of her sons*, and proceeded to storm out of the lobby leaving him there. 


Housekeepers also stated that, on the occasions that they were let into the room (which was starting to look like an episode of hoarders), that the mom and dad would frequently be having nasty fights with each other, with all the children present, and waving the housekeepers to just continue cleaning as if nothing was going on. 


She then got to one of my part-time coworkers when none of us were there, yelling at them that she *knew* we were keeping the computers off and how dare we deny her boys their right to go on them, intimidating my coworker enough that she plugged the router back in and we had to deal with the boys yet again. 


We were starting to get bad SALT scores, and complaints mentioning the boys constantly on the computers, using foul language, and screaming. Around the time that it felt like we were all getting to a breaking point, the dad bought the three of them laptops, and we were mercifully spared from dealing with all three boys at once. However, one would usually be sent down to play on his own...


Which ties into this: After witnessing both of the parents in all their glory, I pulled my FOM aside and said that despite not being mandated reporters, it really felt like we had a duty to call CPS. She informed me that CPS was already involved with the family. And that they had actually mandated that middle child and eldest child (who usually were the biggest source of screaming fights when they were down together) were mandated by *CPS* to not speak, play, or be around eachother. 


So; back to the earlier point of mom wanting an extra room, it suddenly made sense to me that she wanted an extra room, probably to facilitate separating the boys. Except they hadn't been keeping them separate for months, and despite suddenly having the separate rooms, we ended up getting a noise disturbance reported from a room next to them. They were being so loud/things being hit/thrown so heavily that the room next door's bed was being shaken. My FOM called the non emergency police line--a move I agree with. She was there all by herself, and there's no way to know if it was mom vs dad, dad vs mom, or parents vs kids etc.


Well, mom came storming down and ripped into my coworker, accusing her of calling the police on her sons who have autism, threatening legal action, etc. She checked out their extra room then and there, thank god. My FOM was pretty upset, and worried that she'd done something wrong, which I assured her anyone would make the same call. I was proven right as their real, no more extensions, check out date *FINALLY* approached.


We knew that the room was going to be a shithole once they finally cleared out, and were prepared to take it out of order and spend a good few days deep cleaning it. The dad, despite knowing their coming check out date well in advance, basically did nothing to clear it out. He got permission from the GM to clear the room out over the weekend, as cleaning wouldn't start until the next Monday. I was very careful to give keys that were only valid for a few hours every time he came, because I suspected he would happily take a weekend away from those kids + his wife. 


Well, he'd been tooling around in the room for a few hours after I made him keys, and I was in the lull between checkouts at 11 and check ins at 3. Suddenly a guest came running in with a phone to his head, informing me that he was calling the police. Dad had brought kids with him, and left them in the car, unattended, for *hours*. Including the two boys who aren't supposed to be around each other. He was out there, his one kid screaming, while he yanked him around by the arm. Police came and went, saying it was settled. I can't help but judge harshly. My brother's on the spectrum; growing up I saw my fair share of meltdowns, but my parents would employ bear hugs/soothing physical contact, not throw him around/pick him up etc. 


And so that's that. They're out now, and I'm relieved. From my first post my frustration lay mostly with the kids, as we were dealing with the brunt of their behaviour, and didn't see much of the parents. Witnessing both of the parents up close and personal for months now, I just feel sorry for those kids. I wish I could rename my previous titles Two Big Terrors. But I wanted to share this experience, something unlike anything I've dealt with in about a year and a half of hospitality work. I've dealt with rude people, angry people, I've had guests make me cry, but nothing ever like this. 


This closes this tale out in terms of finishing their story with me, and I'm glad that my work has returned to normal and I'm dealing with the regulars that usually frequent this place who are kind, funny people. Despite feeling relief, there's not exactly a feeling of satisfaction. I feel pretty sad for those boys, and I hope CPS is able to actually help them in any way. Thanks for bearing with me to this point.Three Little Terrors: The End of an Era (Final Update)",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This is more of a personal rant from my experience at work today and less like a tale. 

This morning I got into work at 6am. At 7am a guest calls down very angry the outlets in her bathroom don’t work. I go up to the room and can’t reset it and our engineer isn’t in yet. I apologize to the guest and gave her keys to a room next door so she could use it to get ready in. She had stated on the phone she was in a big rush to get ready. After I give her the keys and tell he I can’t reset it she cusses me up one side and down another. I’ll omit most of the foul language but the gist of it was “I’m a f-ing lawyer, you don’t think I know how to work a GD outlet? I paid for four rooms here for my law team. This is extremely unacceptable. And for you to offer me room keys? Absolutely unbelievable. Did I mention I’m a f-ing lawyer?? I’ll be down in an hour and you better have the bills ready for my rooms. It’s not about the money at this point but I am curious to see what you’ll do for me.” 

The hell? Okay so fine I adjust $100 off her last night for her room. Whatever it’s no big, each room was 300 a night. But my engineer came in right when I came down so I called the guest to let her know he could come up and it’s be an easy fix since she didn’t want to go across the hall to dry her hair. Well he came back down and let me know it was her device that had a bad plug and that’s why the outlets seemed they were not working. Go figure. She comes down and looks at her bill. My service director stands beside her and the lady starts telling her she got the run around with me saying engineering wasn’t in then they were and she felt the way I “handled it was unprofessional. And by the way what is the GMs name? I’ll be writing him a letter on fancy lawyer letterhead about my experience with her.”

Shortly after this I’m dealing with a million checkouts and our long term guest with the thick European accent comes to the desk to checkout. The same guest that cussed me up one side and down another in the parking lot one morning at 6:30am a couple months prior to this interaction. My coworker prints his bill for him but it doesn’t include some specific nights he paid using his personal card. I step in and look and those had been transferred to a separate folio. I print this for the guest and apologize. Then he starts trying to explain to me something is wrong with his bill about the dates and charges. I tried explaining to him but he kept getting louder and talking over me. I have guests in the lobby and I understand what he needed. I just needed the folio back to see what I needed to transfer for him (and get to the building line). So finally I just shut up and wait until he breathes and stops talking and kindly let him know. “Yessir like I was trying to tell you.. I see the issue and I apologize let me fix this.  He launches into this whole tirade  “I not understand why you’re so rude to me. Everyone else here is so nice and you are just so mean everyday. I can tell you don’t like me because of the way you treat me different from the other guests. But it doesn’t matter I don’t like you either because you have a very ugly attitude and rude personality.” Grabs his new bill I made for him during the 5 minute rant about my character and walks off. 

I am exhausted. Today was awful. Day 7 of 8 in a row. I’m 8 months pregnant and counting down the days until my maternity leave.  These guests were awful today!

"First post!  I have a bunch of stories that I'll eventually share because I have a lot but I always find myself re-annoyed with this interaction from a few months ago lol.  Sorry for all the caps in this, I just needed to emphasize that this man was absolutely berserk.

**BACKSTORY:**  I normally work first shift.  I come in at 7am, our night audit fills me in on the happenings of the previous night.  That morning, she said they had a complaint in the middle of the night that a drunk couple was making too much noise, so security went up (obviously didn't hear anything too scary at that point), knocked on the door, told them to quiet down, and left.  There were no more complaints.  A little while later, the woman from that room came down to the desk and told our night audit that her boyfriend knocked the TV over and that the screen was shattered, gave her credit card and contact info and said to just charge whatever the damages were.  The night audit said everything was taken care of and the couple checked out already, just wanted to warn me that people might be mad about noise last night and to let a manager know about the TV if they didn't see her email.  It sounded like they just had a wild night or an argument.  Night audit goes home.

At around 9am, this guy (ANGRY MAN) comes down to the desk to check out.  He's stayed here before, I say ""Hi, good morning!  Checking out?""

**ANGRY MAN:** I am NOT staying here again.  

**Me, still smiling:** Uhhh...I'm sorry sir, what happened?

**ANGRY MAN:** What the HELL was going on last night?!  I was kept awake ALL NIGHT!  DID YOU NOT HEAR THAT WOMAN YELLING?!?!

**Me:** Oh, she came down and spoke to us about the situation.  I apologize--

**ANGRY MAN:** Oh, you TALKED TO HER? WHAT HAPPENED??!!

**Me, really confused why this man is SO worked up:** There was a noise complaint, our security guard went up to the room, and the guest came down to talk to us.  They were drunk and a TV ended up getting knocked over and broken.

**ANGRY MAN, silent and staring at me like I'm a complete idiot:** Their TV was broken?

**Me:** Yeah, like \*makes hand gestures like something tipping over and falling\* their TV was knocked over and the screen shattered.  Maybe the yelling you heard was her being scared by the crash?

**ANGRY MAN:** YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY ALL OF THAT SCREAMING WAS BECAUSE THEIR TV BROKE?

**Me:** I'm sorry, I really don't know what you're referring to, I wasn't working last night.  That's what I was told--

**ANGRY MAN:** I HEARD A WOMAN SCREAMING LIKE SHE WAS BEING MURDERED FOR OVER 30 MINUTES!!!  

**Me:** Uh??? I'm sorry, did you let the front desk know that's what you were hearing?  We weren't informed of any emergency situations, just that a room was making too much noise.  I'm sorry that the noise disturbed you, but again, we spoke to the guest and--

**ANGRY MAN:** NO, I THOUGHT SOMEONE WOULD COME CHECK.  NO ONE EVEN CALLED ME BACK TO TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON OR IF THAT WOMAN WAS STILL ALIVE!  IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE WAS BEING KILLED IN THERE!  I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT TERRIFIED WONDERING IF THERE WAS A DEAD BODY IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR!!

**Me:** We wouldn't have been able to call you with any updates due to guest privacy but our security did go up--

**ANGRY MAN:**  I am EXTREMELY UPSET and I am NEVER coming back!  \*Walks away before I can say anything else\*

&amp;#x200B;

And THEN....... a few days later a review pops up of this man saying he heard a woman screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night, our staff did nothing and that this is clearly a dangerous place, and then says that I *laughed at him* and told him all the screaming was because their TV wasn't working.

I don't doubt this guy's story, he didn't ask for any compensation, and we (at the desk) only know so much about what goes on in the rooms since we're usually multiple floors below.  But, personally, if I heard a woman screaming ""like she was being killed"" and was ""kept up all night wondering if someone had been MURDERED"" as he stated multiple times, I think I might.....call the police?  Or call the front desk and say ""I hear a woman screaming like she's being attacked and things are being broken, I think you might need the police involved"" instead of ""the drunk couple next door is yelling and I wanna sleep"".  

Like damn you really thought this poor woman was being beaten to death right next door to you and it upset you because it was KEEPING YOU AWAKE?  Luckily she (appeared) to be okay so hopefully it was just a drunken argument that got out of hand but everything about this situation still makes me mad.The Review That Still Bothers Me",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Got a short one for you!

Years ago, in the ‘90’s, I worked in various management capacities at a 300+ room DT Luxury hotel. One week we knew the 5 Star inspector was going to be in house doing his inspection to confirm our rating for another 2 years.

He did this by being a ‘secret guest’ at first, he would checkin anonymously and use the hotel services for a day or two, then make himself known and spend a few hours with department heads evaluating their services.

He had made himself known and then spent his time with Room Service and The Fine Dining Room and now was going to spend the morning with the Executive Housekeeper inspecting rooms. I came along for the ride so as to let them in the vacant rooms, we were still on mechanical locks back then. 

We would spend about 20 minutes in each one of the room types inspecting it in great detail, in fact he would pull the drawers out of the dresser and flip the mattresses over.

They were finishing up the last room and the inspector has been full of praise, and is just flipping over the mattress when a couple of porno mags stashed underneath, slide out and land at his feet. Not just any porno mags, not lightweights like Playboy or Hustler, they were hardcore mags featuring BDSM, Scat and Beastiality. (I’m not judging).

The Exec HK and I freeze, look at the mags, look at each other, look at the mags and then look at the inspector. We are sure we are gonna lose our Stars on the spot. The Inspector finally says, ‘people sure are crazy! But I’ve seen worse!’ He picks up the mags and hands them to me, but I’m not touching them! I grab the waste basket and he puts them in it.

We finished the room and he never spoke of them again. We kept our Stars and our rating. HK added a peek under the mattresses to their cleaning routine.5 Star Inspection",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So a good story!

WW= wonderful woman
Me= me duh!

So I checked in this older woman (maybe late 60s early 70s) about an hour ago or so and she came back down after going into her room and she was going to her car and then she stops herself and walks back in and comes up to my desk.

WW: so I forgot to tell you earlier, thank you so much for being out

Me: *looks at her kind of confused* out?......

It took me only a few seconds to realize she was thanking me for being an out gay man

Me: Oooooh! I see what you mean.....um.....thank you? I apologize I’ve never had anyone thank me for something like that before 

WW: well back then you didn’t see anyone out, it was always very hush hush and I always felt so bad for you guys. It’s makes me happy to see that everyone is able to be happy and themselves more and more each day with every city I go to. I really hope your happy

Me: yes ma’am I’m very happy and very lucky enough to have lots of very supportive family and friends

"Our bar closes at 10pm. That's admittedly kind of early but we're not a large hotel so there's not nearly enough traffic on most nights to warrant it being open later. We don't sell beer or wine in our market so after 10pm, the property is completely dry. (Keep in mind, we're in the south so alcohol laws are very strict around here. I don't know if local law dictates our license only let's us sell up to 10pm but it's a good bet that it does. So I'm not messing around with it).

A woman came up one time around 10:30 and said her group missed last call because they were all chatting on the other side of the bar, not paying attention. She asked if I could come pour her a vodka-tonic. I told her I'm not licensed to pour drinks and that the bar was closed anyway. Of course she just says something along the lines of ""no, no, that's ok. I can tell you what to do!"". I told her that doesn't matter and that I'm not legally allowed to pour drinks. I also reiterated that our liquor license is very strict on when we can sell alcohol. She just wasn't getting it and kept persisting, getting more and more agitated as I kept shutting her down. Then she just stormed away after the 5th time of me saying no (yes, I actually counted how many times I had to say no). All her coworkers gave me the stinkface on their way back up to the room.

Then last night 15 minutes after the bar closed, a different guy comes up to the desk, visibly furious. He says ""the lady at the bar just told me they're closed and that I can not have a drink. I am a *snowflake tier elite member* and DEMAND to be accommodated!"" I recite the usual ""I'm sorry. The bars closed and were only legally allowed to sell up to 10pm"". He responds with something like ""I do not give a shit about any of that. Now are you going to come pour me a drink or tell me to fuck off"". I didn't know what to say because I was just blown away with how childish he was being, so I just stared back at him. He eventually got the message and just left, cursing the whole way down the hallway.

People need to grow up. You're not a 20 yr old sophomore in college, alcohol is not that important. I'll never understand casual dependency on alcohol a lot of people have. It's not even that they have a problem with it, there's just a societal pressure to have a drink with coworkers after a day in the office. Come on, it's 11pm on a Tuesday night... You have to work tomorrow. Go to sleep, Karen.Guests freak out when we can't sell alcohol after 10pm",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So we just finished construction and opened up our new restaurant and bar on the 30th of last month. I was super excited because it's been a 2 year process in waiting. They even let all the employees try the food and its actually amazing. We have farm to table food which honestly impressed me! (I worked at a Shmilton Harden Spinn and the food was terrible, frozen junk fresh off the Sysco truck). The excitement was short lived... even though the food is amazing we are getting a lot of complaints that the Continental breakfast is no longer a thing and now our guest will have to pay for breakfast.

Honestly I wouldn't be writing this if ever guest was at least somewhat sane about the whole thing but guest are going crazy. They will cause a fuss at check in. Saying ""They were told we have continental breakfast!"" and ""WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?"" oh and my favorite ""wE wIlL nEvEr StAy HeRe AgAiN!""

My managers solution is to take off 20-30 off A NIGHT from their room rate and even on top of that offer them complimentary breakfast for one night to try it out. Honestly it doesn't matter to me what we give the guest because obviously it doesn't effect me. I just feel weird when the guest is already acting a fool (obviously trying to get something from us) and we are taking 20-30 off their room rate. Like that 20 more than covers their breakfast bill so it is like we are giving them free breakfast any way.

Honestly I don't understand why everyone is so hung up on this breakfast thing. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST SUCKS! (I've been to some nice hotels that have like a really nice breakfast platter but that is FEW and FAR between). I'm talking about the boiled/steamed eggs in a bag (yes, that's how they cook those eggs because most places don't have a full kitchen). The microwaved bacon. The oatmeal with only a few toppings. Don't get me started on the stale cereal, and the weird store bought pastries. I can't be the only one that hates the stuff. Like yes I will grab maybe a scoop of eggs and the pastries. Probably take two bites and throw it out cause its gross! 

When a hotel has a restaurant and you are paying for guaranteed made to order HOT food. I will pay for that premium 10/10. I am just tired of every night having guest go crazy over having to pay for breakfast. Also I guess I will add this isn't like a CRAZY new concept alot of hotels that have restaurants in them charge their guest for breakfast. My tipping point today was a guest literally said, ""I work in hotels, and it seems like a lot of them are leaning towards this. We don't really eat to much so it shouldn't be a problem"" she said this and then went on a tangent of how ""No OnE tOlD mE BrEaKfAsT wAsN't CoMpLeMeNtaRy???"" and ""We NeEd To Do SoMeThInG!!""

"Background: The hotel I work at is a hybrid of a capsule hotel and a regular hotel. We have two different brands but they’re run by the same company and use two different property management systems. This means that I have to switch between hotels to search for customers, so, to aid this painful step, I usually start by asking the guest which hotel they’re staying at. 


Me: Hello! Checking in?


Guest: Yes, my name is Guest. 


Me: Okay, can I ask which hotel you’re staying in? A or the B Capsules? 


Guest: This one here. 


Me: I understand. We have two different hotels at this one reception counter, so to search your name, I need to know which hotel I should be searching. Was it A or the B Capsules? 


Guest: I made my reservation on BookingSite. 


Me: I see. And did you make the reservation for our normal hotel or for the capsule hotel? 


Guest: You have capsules here? 


Me: Yes, we do. 


Guest: I didn’t reserve a capsule hotel. I made a reservation for here. 


Me: Understood, I’ll look your name up in the A system. 


Honestly, it may have been faster to just search his name in both systems but logging in and out is a pain on the current PMS- in addition to there being three different ways (minimum) to write his name - potentially tripling the search time. Even to look up the reservation number requires bouncing between the two hotel’s systems.Two hotels in one building",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Super long, courtesy tl;dr at the end. 

Relevant post [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/dxjgp6/the_times_they_are_achanging/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/e20r0t/the_times_they_are_achanging_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) for those that aren’t following or, more likely, have forgotten because it’s the internet and also it’s been a while.  

Let’s jump in!

I applied and interviewed for the new property opening and was offered the job. Told our new management company but also let them know that I wouldn’t be leaving until the beginning of February. 

Well that is today! I gave a 30 day notice at the beginning of January (I was only doing 2 weeks but they offered me a slight raise to give them a full month to “ensure the proper training of the new general manager”). 

The last few months have been quite hectic. While still working at my current (now former but we’ll go with current) hotel my new employers have asked if I could be available part time, as they had no other properties in my city I was one of the only people on the ground once the construction was complete and prepping for opening had begun so I have given up all of my free nights to getting other work done, which has allowed me to mingle with a LOT of the corporate folk as they come in and out. I’ve also been conducting interviews for my new employees, as well as the ones who are coming with me, and having that going on has been exhausting. Luckily it was a slower than usual season for us, with occupancy dropping to low double digits more than a few times, so being in two places was easy enough most of the time. 

I checked, it wasn’t because there was no one coming in, and our poor hotel is getting to the point where the need for a remodel is somehow more obvious than before. Our staff still gets amazing reviews pretty regularly but when the slower seasons come and people can pick other properties for the same price, they’re going to go for it.  You don’t go out of town to a hotel that looks like your grandma’s living room (unless that’s your thing?) unless options are limited. 

I’m only taking a handful of staff, some couldn’t go because of the farther travel, some just didn’t want to risk it, etc. I respect their choices and some of those people, mostly in support staff, have been there since before the last time the hotel was sold in 2011 so they’re happy enough where they are. My AGM is coming, along with my Sales Manager, and my head housekeeper (yeah, I’m robbing department heads, they’re very good it’s why I want them!) There are some in house promotions going on and of course some outside hires. We’ve had 2 department heads in training for 2 weeks, with sales and my replacement in training for the last month.  

In a super fun twist, I have recently begun to date one of my employees, a FDA. Not in a scandalous way, or anything. Because of my position, I am not allowed to date anyone in the building as our fairly standard company policy on that says you cannot be involved with someone who reports to you. Since everyone reports to me...you know where this is going.

This girl, however, has worked there for a while, when I hired her I was in a pretty serious relationship that unfortunately ended and blah blah, but suffice to say I wasn’t looking for anyone, I’d had my rebound and was now just mostly focusing on prepping for the interview for my new job, as I knew there would be several rounds. 

Anywho, I tell you this because this girl was my pick to take over the FOM position after the current FOM moved to AGM. The two are unrelated because she was already my first choice when I had been thinking about who I’d want to take and who not. I never considered taking her because there wasn’t a manager slot available after I filled AGM and Sales and corporate filled maintenance, restaurant, and front office and moving from a position to the same one but without knowing most of your co-workers isn’t super appealing.  

No, we didn’t get together until I’d made my picks and promoted her. Her move to front office manager has put her in considerably closer proximity to me and with greater frequency. Normally I’d just ignore it but since I was getting ready to leave, why not? No one knows, as to prevent anyone from claiming favoritism we are never alone together, nor do we ever arrive or leave together. I’m now making up stories of the shenanigans I got into when single (dinner parties gone awry, that sort of thing) just to keep up appearances. 

My replacement is a pretty cool dude. I actually know him decently well. He used to run a property a couple miles down the street from mine. And let me tell you, he kept that place running for years while God himself tried to smite it. Next to the busiest freeway off ramp, which had a solid dozen panhandlers on either side of it, across the street from the scariest fucking 7-11 I’ve ever seen, with more junkies than overcooked roller dogs hanging out there. 3 blocks away? Not one but two catholic charity shelters. It was rough. It’s amazing how quickly the neighborhoods change downtown. I drive by it on my way to work every day, and I’ve seen that guy literally putting out a fire. And after all that, he kept it running and nearly full without having too many murders. 

Eventually someone finally saw fit to just shut that place down, it was still losing money. One of my recent housekeeper hires came from there and she said he is pretty cool.  Vastly different management style, but that’s perfectly fine. 

I tell all of you this boring and kind of convoluted story for a couple reasons. Figured since I’d already done two parts, might as well make it a trilogy. 

The other reason is I know some of the other managers at the airport properties and from what I understand, because of the location of the airport, they don’t have any of the problems we do in downtown. No people chasing their front desk employees, no sirens every time there’s an incident at a nearby bar. 

Without that stuff, I won’t have much else to write about. Combine that with the fact that this is a much larger hotel, which responsibilities I did not have before, amenities that don’t exist at my current hotel, I’m probably not going to be working the desk very often anymore. I’m gonna try, but I’m pretty picky about what snowflake meltdown stories I think are worth telling, so aside from crew nightmares, I might not have many stories worth telling. I’ll still be reading all of yours!

Oh and the last thing, because it’s not a day in my hotel if one system isn’t in catastrophic failure. Our phone system...I have begged both the former and current management companies about redoing the phone system. It’s old, the phone barely works, and it’s been randomly just dying for hours on end. The silence is nice...until it finally came back on. 

It was installed when the hotel was built in 1996, and has not been updated since. I’ve just been told it’s too expensive, with the cost to redo it ranging from $20k to $40k. I have no idea if that’s true but it’s the most answer I got. 

Well today it died. Completely. Could not be resurrected. On my last day. I did what I could today but it’s now the new GM’s problem. He’ll be fine. Probs.  

Soooo, that’s it. The hotel opens March first, we’re down to our opening day, but the new employers are giving everyone who has been working for the past several months (and weeks in the case of the management hires who have been working with me) a week off right before the opening to relax. Which is just super awesome because I am tired. 

tl;dr got new job, in better location, in brand new building, I prepare to be a lot busier, and my old building gives me the finger on my last day.The times they are a-changing, part 3",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello kiddies. It's time for another tale from the tweaker files. 

So last night was not a good one. I was already exhausted when I came in for my audit shift because instead of sleeping, I had spent the day installing a security system in my house. My fault I know, but needless to say, I was hoping for a quiet night of Netflix and Xbox. Since it was the one night of the month that they take our system down for updates, it should have been smooth sailing... not so much.

When I arrived at work, I had to wait to get into the office so that my coworker could temporarily move trash cans that were collecting water dripping from the ceiling. This was weird because, not only had it not been raining, there is a room directly above the office. 

Then I get the story.

Apparently the long term guest (don't get me started on that) staying in the room above had clogged his toilet, then tried to clear it with multiple bottles of drano. When that didn't work, he had tried to plunge it so aggressively that he broke the wax seal, causing it to empty its contents onto the bathroom floor. Of course he didn't tell anyone in time to get it mopped up before it soaked through the floor. 

So yes, the water dripping from the ceiling into my office was toilet water that smelled heavily of chemicals. Between that and my lack of sleep, I developed a massive headache in no time. Even worse, the leak was right in front of my office door, so try as I might, I couldn't go in or out of my office without getting dripped on.

Believe it or not, he's not even the tweaker in the title.

Because of the bathroom issue, my coworker had tried to move him to another room. He refused. So as a compromise, she gave him a key to an unused room to use the facilities.

I'm just getting settled into my shift when I get a call from the room with the toilet issue.

Him: Who did you put in my room?

Me: Huh?

Him: I went to go use the bathroom in that other room and there's someone in there.

Me: There shouldn't be.

Him: Well there is. The door's locked and the TV's on.

Me: I'm sorry about that. I'll check it out and call you back.

I first try calling the room. No answer of course. So I grab the emergency key that opens any door even if the deadbolt is locked and a fresh key for the room to cancel out any old keys.

When I get to the room, I can hear someone inside. I break out my cop knock, not expecting an answer. I'm just about to use the key when the door finally opens. 

Enter the tweaker.

Me: Excuse me, but who are you?

Her: (Defensively) This is my friend's room.

Me: Okay. Where's your friend? 

Her: She's down at the casino. She'll be back later. 

Me: And what's her name?

She gives it to me, and I foolishly leave her in the room to go look up her friend's name. In hindsight, I realize I should have made her come with me, but I wasn't thinking straight because of the headache.

When I get back to my desk, I go to look up her friend's name in case she just had the wrong room. Then I remember the computers are down, so I look through the paper registrations, which takes a while. Not finding anything remotely similar, I call my manager. No answer. Again in hindsight, I should have just called the cops, but I wasn't thinking straight.

I call the room again and tell her there's nobody by her friend's name listed in the hotel.

Her: Actually, I called her and she said the room is actually her friend's.

Me: And what's that friend's name?

Her: I don't know.

Me: Okay. I'm not sure what's going on here, but I need you to come down here so I can scan your card and try to figure out what's going on.

Her: I don't have a key. My friend let me in.

Me: I'm still going to need you to come down.

Her: Okay.

I hang up and my manager calls me back. I tell him the story and he tells me that there shouldn't be anybody in that room, nor could anyone have been accidentally put in there because it was taken out of order.

I call the room again and get no answer, so I grab my keys again and head up there. Of course the room is empty except for some white crystals on the bedspread. I swipe the new key, locking her out just in case she somehow got one. (Occasionally I find keys people have dropped in the hallway.)

I went back to the desk to call the cops only to find one already there. Since we've gotten a bad reputation, the local PD has assigned officers to stop in to check on us. The one that comes on my shift  is pretty cool and just comes in to bs when he's having a slow night. I tell him what happened and take him up to the room where he confirms that the crystals are meth. He bags what he can and tells me to make sure to wash the bedspread before anyone stays in the room. Unfortunately, since she already bailed, there's not much he can do except to tell me to call him if she comes back. He took a description, but I doubt it was helpful. She looked like a skinny tweaker chick.

As for how she got into the room, I'm guessing, even though he swears he didn't, that the guy from the room with the bathroom issue flipped the security latch so he wouldn't need the key to get back in. Along comes tweaker chick, she finds an empty open room, and decides to move in.

The rest of my night was fairly uneventful except for the guy screaming at his wife/gf/hookup in the hall at 3 am. Not much to tell there because he left before I could boot him.

Infuriating side note. My manager actually comped the guy with the clogged toilet a night. As far as I'm concerned, he's been in there at least a couple of weeks. The toilet worked fine when he checked in. Any problems with it were caused by him. But whatever.This is not your friend's room. Nope, it's not her friend's either",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey all. Night auditor here. I have a fun, short little tale for everyone from tonight. I get in to hear that there are a few angry people on property. So it goes, I suppose. I walk to front desk to see a monitor with maybe half of the display working. Apparently one of the day shift darlings mistook the phone for a football and spiked it into the screen before I came in for the night. Now I’m just genuinely hoping none of the aforementioned angry people come in requesting any info from the right side of my screen.Computer trouble?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tonight, I had a couple of obviously homeless folks come in and tell me they lost a phone in the bathroom of our restaurant (which is next door, and locked up).

I don't think it would be a wise move to go and unlock the empty, dark restaurant with two strangers who are obviously a bit on the desperate side coming in with me.  I am not ready to fight for my life or have to deal with some sort of scam.

I fibbed a little and told them that I don't have a key to get in. (true, except I could just program one)

I would also have to have left the front desk empty with the cash drawer. I have also heard of a lot of two person scams where they just run one way or the other and grab whatever they can.

"Last night was an interesting one. Earlier in the day had a Gold member check into a room that was occupied but was in our system as vacant. Come to find another FD agent didn't hit save after she moved a different guest (let's call that guest Kate) into that room. Easy fix, moved the gold guest, move Kate in the system to the right room. Should be good.

Around 9:45 Kate calls down asking for her sheets to be changed because her room wasn't serviced. Why? HK found that the Vacant room was occupied, didn't tell the FD and just left it. Our PM Bell goes to change it and finds a blood stain and a dead bug. He changed the sheets and brought me the bug. I wasn't sure what it was but made notes. 15 minutes later Kate calls down that she found live ones. We move her room, apologize, breakfast voucher. Bell goes and helps her move and gets the live bug. Well I think we all know what kind of bug it is... Problem is shes been in 3 separate room all across the 3rd floor. So we're going to have to take minimum 9 rooms out of order, maybe even the whole floor which is over a third of our rooms.

Without any warning. About half of the workforce was out of a job. It breaks my heart that they are out of a job because we were all so well connected. So naturally since we were so close (physically and litterally) we inquired about our hotel. Not demanding anything. Just wondering if we were up for sale and if we had jobs. The GM got furious at our accusations and basically brushed off the question. No one feels any job security. My shuttle driver is puking his brains out just cause he's afraid to call in. Meanwhile an ex night auditor at the sister location calls me and tells me our pay has been screwed up. That whoever's is doing payroll (GM) is screwing up. Putting in the time (ex: 8.30) instead of in 100's (ex: 8.5) and shorting our time. I'm afraid to speak out or go against them because I really don't want to lose another job. But the owners and the gm are acting very strange and I don't like it.They shut down our sister location,TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This happened late July 2018 at my last hotel, a generally sleepy little suburban full service branded franchise hotel. I was nominally Director of Rooms at the hotel, but I spent more time working as a FD Agent and Night Auditor at this place than I ever have since becoming a manager. The FD had an FOM and 2 supervisors, so I was frequently MOD or even just a one-man show. 

This is the story of the worst 3 days of my 20-year career. 

It all started on a Saturday. It had been my day off, so the wife and I had driven out to the coast, had lunch at a new place, and generally just a great time. Then my phone rang. Caller ID said it was my FOM calling me. Never a good sign.

""Kaoswzrd we're totally fucked."" In the background I heard the fire alarm going off.

Now, at our hotel, when the alarm went off, the Fire Department required us to evacuate the entire building until they cleared us for reentry. I first experienced that while Taskforcing at the hotel my first weekend there. A pain in the ass, but had happened often enough that I knew my FOM could handle just a fire alarm.

""What happened?""

""The guest in 403 set off her fire sprinkler. Flooded her room, everything around her and it's all raining down to the floors below.""

""What?! How!?"" I was already stripping out of my weekend clothes and mentally debating whether I'd take a shower before heading in or not.

""I don't even know, but I need you here. I have my cousin's bachelorette trip this weekend and I'm the maid of honor, I need to leave in an hour.""

I already knew we were sold out for the weekend. Sunday would have been my ""Monday"". The Sox were playing. Taylor Swift had a concert at the football stadium. 

""On my way. Call \[the DoRM\] and make sure we're hard closed for new bookings."" At the very least I knew I'd be relocating the impacted rooms. 

I was sweaty and needed a shave. I opted to shower, while my lovely wife pulled clothes and threw together an ""oh shit bag"" for me.

While I showered and shaved, my phone exploded with calls from my DoRM, Chief Engineer, and GM. 

I called my GM from the call. He was out of the state, on his way back, but wouldn't be on the scene till Sunday at the soonest. The Shitshow was my show. 

By the time I arrived the Fire Department and Building Inspector were on the scene and the hotel was still under evacuation. I walked into the middle of the conversation between the city officials and my FOM.

""We're closing the hotel."" The building inspector

""The entire hotel?"" My stomach clenched. ""Hold on. You need to explain this to my GM.""

I got the GM on the phone with the building inspector. If anyone was gonna twist this guy's arm into not shutting us down, it was him. But no luck.

While the GM was trying to work his magic. I got caught up to speed.

The date of the best man for one of the weddings we had in house (we had 3 wedding groups that weekend) had hung her dress up in the room from a fire sprinkler. A fire sprinkler that had a little sign next to it with a crossed-out clothes hanger on it. Seriously. The dress hadn't just triggered the sprinkler, it had snapped the sprinkler head out of the fixture. So they'd had to shut off the entire sprinkler system to stop the water. The building was 5 stories tall, she was on the 4th floor, at the beginning of the hall, and directly over the lobby. So it was raining in the bar. 

So final word from the building inspector was that he was pulling our occupancy permit for the entire building. And he wasn't going to clear us until an Electrician could certify that all the wiring in the flooded section wasn't compromised. 

All of this boiled down just in time for my FOM to leave. It was about 4 PM. 

So I got on the PA and made a building-wide announcement. Most of our guests were down in the lobby or just outside the front doors, but I knew there were at least a few still upstairs (despite the building alarm and instruction to evacuate). 

Thus began the process of relocating 247 rooms from the hotel into a sold-out market, plus 2 on-site weddings for Sunday. It was a marathon. Our Sales Coordinator and Group Rooms Coordinator heard what was going on from other staff and came in to help. My FD agents buckled in.

It was actually a tremendous marathon of teamwork that I'm still very proud of.

I'm sure you all can imagine, reactions ranged from understanding and gracious to red-faced rage and everything in-between. Most people were super understanding, far more than I expected. But the difficult ones were a pain because there was literally nothing I could do. 

I'm glad I didn't find this out until much later, but the guest who had caused the entire disaster was heard out in the parking lot complaining that the water from the sprinkler had messed up her hair and destroyed her dress. I don't know if I could have controlled myself if she'd come to complain to me about it. 

I was on the desk until about 4 AM that night (morning?) until I finally felt like my Night Auditor could handle the remaining 2 or 3 arrivals (which we had located rooms for). I went to one of our (illegal to occupy but dry) rooms and passed out for a couple of hours. Then came back down to greet the AM FD Agent. 

We'd had hopes of getting reopened that day (Sunday). It didn't happen. 

Or the next day. 

I ended up not leaving the building until Sunday evening at about 6 PM when our DoRM came in to be MOD and relieve me. Went home, passed out, came back in first thing Monday morning,

Monday's relocations were the toughest. They were all of our regulars (business travelers). Generally understanding, and I was able to email most and reroute them before they showed up at the hotel. Most of the people screaming at me at the FD had stopped by that point. 

Even when we reopened on Tuesday, we still had a ton of rooms Out of Order. For 3 months!

I worked a lot on the final insurance claim. Well over a quarter of a million dollars. I know the guest who caused it didn't have anything to put a dent in it. No idea if Insurance went after her...but I made sure they had her contact information.The Sold Out Saturday when I closed the Hotel",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Here at our ye ol' hotel, we are increasingly having problems with older folks who have heard about Uber, but have absolutely no idea how it works, needing rides in our little suburb that has no really functional public transportation options. 

In the most recent instance of this. An older woman came to the desk a bit agitated and saying, I quote: ""I can't get uber working at this hotel"". 

She's got her phone in hand and is actively fiddling with it so I assume she just has been having trouble connecting onto the wifi perhaps. 

I begin to tell her how to get her device connected to our network and she interrupts me to say ""I don't have wifi"". 

ok....?

She tells me she needs to get to the next city over and she just gave her credit card number out two times but ""Uber said they do not come here"". 

Oh boy....

Now realizing that this woman may be slightly intoxicated and has very possibly just been scammed out of some money by god knows who, I explain that Uber most certainly services this area, and whoever she was actually talking to was not Uber, as it is done through an app on your phone. 

She then says, we need a ride and are getting pretty desperate now, can you just call me an Uber?

I reiterate that Uber is done through an App, and is not a service that you call up like a taxi company.  

She then asks me to call her a taxi then.  And I have to explain that any local cab companies (which were very few to begin with as we are a suburban area about 25 miles outside a major city) have been since put out of business by Uber and Lyft being much more popular and affordable options. 

I let her know that the closest taxi companies available to contact would be from downtown, and they would be rather expensive options given they have to come all the way out here just to take her to the destination that is only 2.5 miles away that she wants to go to. 

She then goes back to asking me to call her an Uber.  So I start trying my best to explain to this woman who has clearly never used the service how it works. I tell her she needs to download the app to her phone. 

""You said you use Uber, can't you just do it for me?"" 

I explain that it does not work that way, as the app on my phone is tied to my personal bank account and location, and she would need to use her own phone to set it up on. 

""I can just give you my bank account info!""

Further explaining that it doesn't work that way, she is now agitated and reacting as if i am purposefully being difficult and refusing to help her.  She angrily storms away from the desk. 

About 10 minutes later she calls the desk from her room saying ""yeah....I need you to call me a taxi!""

Having already gone over the high cost and inefficiency of this decision, I tell her to give me a moment and I will google the numbers to the closest companies I can find who will service this area. 

She angrily cuts me off, at this point yelling ""YOU ARE THE HOTEL MANAGER! AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THIS FOR ME?""

(I am not the manager by the way, but even if I was....no)

I tell her that I can provide her the phone numbers, but cannot order the service for her, as she would need to agree to the price and provide them her payment information. 

She is now convinced that I am purposely being rude and refusing to help her and hangs up on me (with me being able to hear her utter ""bitch"" as she is hanging up the phone.)

"I'm really happy I found this Subreddit! I have quite a few stories to tell....

1st one... My 2nd night... 2 elderly ladies come in and ask for a room. Very kind, laughing, lovable ladies. I ask for her ID and her street address says L. Ron Hubbard way! THEY WERE SCIENTOLOGISTS! Nothing too crazy, just shocking.... I never met a actual scientologist before.

2nd one, about 2 months in... my manager has a deal with a local program to help find people in abusive situations a place to stay. Well sometimes some crazies slip through... So, its about 2am, this lady comes downstairs HAMMERED! She walks up to the desk and the first thing she says is ""Just so you know, I'm a white supremacist."" 

Now I'm white..... but I still had absolutely no response planned for that! So I just said ""uh huh"". Then she starts singing a song .... (this was in the middle of Hurricane Dorian) ""Theres not enough water in Hurricane Dorian, to wash the Haitians out the Bahamas, I came her to f**k all the n****** in Arizona."" 

(and I know I shouldn't of, but i had to record this.... so i just hit record with my phone upside down.)

But that's where I had to stop her. And i was able to talk her back to her room. The next day when it was time for her to leave... she tried to set the room on fire! 


Theres been ALOT MORE! but I'll end with a happy one!

Had a couple from Ireland, they needed help with their luggage up the stairs. So as is part my job, I help. Around 4:30 am they come downstairs saying that they're going to Walmart. Not 30 seconds after they left the power goes out for half the city. (Small hotel, no generator)  They come back and decide to keep me company in the dark lobby while I set up what breakfast I can...

"Guest is called: SBB, Breakfast Lady is ABL

So I get a call for a reservation, SBB then says that they stayed here before, and that they were told the manager gave them a free nights stay, this happened before I even started working at the hotel chain, a whole month before. SBB gave me the last name on file, the approximate date (SBB only told me it was several months ago, not the actual date) and the room number, SBB didn't even sound unsure about the room number. I've also cross checked the name with the room number, and the entirety of September and onwards. No one came up in that room, by that name. Also, I don't even have the authority to just erase the rate, and haven't been given clearance to just check someone in for free. I ran a profile search for everyone with that same last name, and none of them match up with the address we were given, not even the same state. 

But there's one last thing. I searched the name, and found 2 people by that name, one was paid for by a company, so it couldn't have been that one. And the last one clearly states that they live in a completely different state, they also only had ONE adult on file, this person made it clear they BOTH stayed there, and had a bad experience, there is also NO discount code or anything, which is odd, and on top of that, why wouldn't you take a reduced price from a place you likely don't want to stay at again, instead of taking another free stay? This isn't exactly spelling out legit.

SBB shows up 30 MINUTES after calling, and she is mad because I can't check her in, I explained multiple times that I couldn't do that because I need a managers approval, on top of that, I don't even know HOW to do that, aside from just not checking her in at all and giving her a room under the radar, not happening at all btw. SBB sits in the lobby and makes some calls, I assume for her ride to come back. NOPE! SBB's calling corporate on me, I let her stay up until the call ends, but a few things happen before that. A) ABL comes in for the morning, and I spill the beans on this... Fantastic person, B) I try and call one of my managers, they don't respond until the situation has been dealt with, which is fine and all. So I decided to step out and call my manager.

Alright, so I called my other manager and they picked up, where I explained the situation, and they revealed to me that they hand out certificates to prove their claims, which makes sense, and my manager said that not only did they not give a certificate out to the name of the person I got ahold of, but that if they couldn't provide one, I was able to kick them out. A WHOLE hour was filled with me burning with rage, like, the heat of the lobby made it hard to breathe, and I was close to losing my temper, it was mostly that I felt powerless as she lied to corporate about the events.  ABL decides to back me up, and we both go out to confront her, whereupon she admits she has no certificate, and that this complaint was over the phone, erm, wat? You claimed you both stayed here, besides, I don't even know if you could use HIS certificate if you even had one. So I say it

""I just talked to my manager, they confirmed that you had no such free night here ma'am, I have been authorized to ask you to leave"". She's baffled, and she claims I'm being rude, she even says THIS

""I lost my kid 7 years ago, and this is the worst I've been humiliated."" My brain is working overtime to not broil alive, she's using child tragedies to try and get me to sympathize with her and NOT follow policy. Then, she does the unthinkable, and tries to lie to ABL about what happened, ABL takes fuck all from SBB and backs me up, not giving her any thought, and I interrupt her to tell her that she needs to leave 

""I AM leaving! I'm calling my ride!-"" I cut her off

""No, you need to get your things and walk out those doors, you are no longer welcome here"". My tone was firm, leaving no room for argument. SBB brags about how bad this will look for us, sending her out in the cold. I stepped outside to make my calls, and I only had my dress pants, undershirt, and dress shirt, she was bundled up for sure, so I'm not buying it. The second she's out of sight I am jumping for joy and I looked like a coked out kid on Christmas, I had never been so happy at my job. That's the complete take of this... Absolute shitshow of a night. Thank you all for joining me on this wild ride!Really suspicious people claiming they get a free stay.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I work for a not-quite-a-hotel in a coastal city with an airport, so many of the \~locals who stay here (mostly people who live on the surrounding small islands, or who live a couple of hours away) are doing so before or after catching a flight. We see several of them semi-regularly. 

It's currently 12:30am, and I just got a knock on the lobby door from one such regular, who had returned from a flight. The person picking him up had checked in a couple of hours ago and then gone to pick my regular up from the airport. When they came back, the keys weren't working for their unit! The regular came down with his key packet, which clearly indicated his room number. Since it was late and he was clearly tired, I glanced at his ID, interrogated the keys, and only glanced briefly at the screen to note they were programmed for the right room, but didn't look much further into it before reprogramming them and sending him back up.

He'd only wanted two of the four keys in his check-in packet, so after he left, I interrogated one of the extra keys again. This time, I noted that the room number was right, but the dates were from January... I looked back into the room history and yup, those same folks were in that very same unit on those January dates (I assume for their flight out). Coincidental! Somehow he still had the key packet from the first stay, not the key packet we had given them only a couple of hours before...?

We do encourage key return - we even have a key drop box in the elevator lobbies in the parking level, which means people don't have to stop by the front desk to drop them off - but we don't have penalties for keys going home with guests. We still get guests returning after a year, or guests coming from different properties, handing us their keys from the last stay. (This can be mildly annoying when the keys are from a different resort, as some of those resorts still use the magnetic stripe keys while we have been using RFID for quite some time, so we end up just disposing of them anyway.)

Anyway, I think we've all had those experiences with keys being demagnetised by cell phones or other cards, or with the locks being finicky, or with the keycards being in rough shape, but this is sure the first time I've had a guest using the old keys for the exact same room, several weeks later! 

(Also, the nice thing about regulars who stay at my location - they're \[almost\] always really patient and nice, even when their keys aren't working in the middle of the night after a long flight. Gotta love those ones!)Return your keys, please!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I was joyfully attending my beloved front desk one evening, when I got a phone call complaining about some children using the pool after closing time.

The hotel where I work, has two apartment blocks with the pool seperating the two, and the balconies are facing the pool area.

The lobby-building is separated from the two blocks and the pool by a small street with hardly any traffic. 

So I leave the front-desk and venture a across the street to investigate. 

Upon arriving at the pool, I see a couple of kids around 12 years of age, jumping into the pool and generally shrieking and splashing around. 

I politely tell them that the pool's closed, and that from tomorrow, 09.00am, they would be more than welcome to continue with their pool adventures. 

They understand and pack up. 
I retreat back to my front desk, thinking everything is alright. 

Ummmm, no. 

About three minutes later, their mother shows up. 

Cast:

Me: Yours truly
Em: Entitled mother

Em: Excuse me, have you just told my children to leave the pool? 

Me: Yes I did. I'm very sorry, but the pool is only open until 09.00pm, and since it's 09.15, they unfortunately have to leave until 09.00 h tomorrow morning. 

Em: Show me where it says that the pool closes at 09.00pm.

I take her back to the pool and show her the various wooden boards where it says that pool hours are from 09.00 - 21.00 hrs, but she wouldn't have any of that. 

She then proceeds to drag me to the spot where her children had been splashing around previously and were now standing around, looking glumly. 

And just there, nailed against a poor palm tree, was a makeshift advisory board (well, just a sheet of paper, which my GM had printed out that morning) informing the guests about the pool's opening hours - in three languages, that is. 

The Spanish advise said 09.00pm, the English one said the same, but the one in German said 10.00pm. (I'm talking about a hotel on the beautiful island of Mallorca, Spain, here). 
It was obviously a typo, and my GM never bothered to proof-read said sheet. 

Me: weeeeeeell, as you CAN see, the other two languages say 09.00pm, and all the other signs around the pool say the same, so I sincerely apologize for the typo, but I still have to ask your children to leave the pool, as I've had some complaints about the noise. 

Em: I don't care about any typos and other people's complaints. My children can use the pool until 10, since it says it on that sheet of paper. 

Me: Well, again, I apologize for the misunderstanding, but... 

Em: Stop arguing with me. I'll do what I want, and I don't care what you any other guests tell me. It says 10pm on this sheet, and my children will be swimming until 10pm.

Meanwhile, a couple in their early 60s, who are regular clients and awesome people, had appeared on their terrace. 

Enter new cast member:

Crg: cool regular guest

Crg: You, woman, leave him alone, go back to your apartment, and take your offspring with you. 

Em (in broken English): what did you just say? 

Crg: I think you understood me quite well. 

Me: Hey, there's no need to have an argument between guests. You're both on holiday, and you should enjoy yourselves. 

Em: You're both incredibly rude. I will complain about both of you in the morning. 

She then takes her children and walks off. 

Crg: Hey, don't worry about her. We'll have your back. And so will (other regular guests who weren't even present). First thing tomorrow morning, we will talk to GM about this incident. 

I left a not in our diary, explaining everything, and no more hassle for the rest of my shift (it lasts until midnight). 

I come in at 04.00pm the following day to be greeted by a laughing GM. 

GM: So sorry about my typo and the stuff you had to go through. 

Me: Oh, did she complain? 

GM: Oh no, Crg came first thing in the morning telling me that you got attacked by a wild guest. 
And about ten minutes later (other regulars) said the same thing. Is it really true? Because if she did, I will personally pack her suitcases. 

Me: Ummm, well, Crg1 and Crg2 did exaggerate a bit. She never attacked me physically. 

GM: Well, if she does come down to complain, I'm going to pack her suitcases, anyway. 

Anticlimax: she never complained, nor did she leave a bad review. 

Btw: our manageress is a petite woman of about 1.65m (sorry, no idea about imperial measurements, although I'm half English).Your typo - our joy",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Okay, so this actually happened to my coworker (that works in the resturant in the hotel) but I thought it would be enjoyed here. (Excuse format, I'm on mobile)
There's a guy staying with us for a few days and he's the instructor for a few training classes happening here for an off site company in our board room. 
Today when they gave us the order form for their lunch my coworker noticed the instructor ordered from the dinner menu from his room, instead of the provided lunch menus the class was given. When she went upstairs to let him know that he had to order from the lunch menu he yelled, ""I'll have you fired!"" to which she replied ""That's fine sir, but you'll need to order from the lunch menu or you don't eat.""I'll have you fired!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm babysitting the front desk as one does when it is slow when in pops an older gentleman. He wants to check in. I look up his last name, no dice. I ask to see an itinerary in case there's something funky, I can pull a confirmation number or see that they booked the location ten minutes away and got confused. Or if it's a third party that didn't come to our system for some reason.

The guest questions me. ""Really?"" he sighs. He has an attitude as if I'm stupid. He goes out to his truck and returns with a folded piece of paper. He throws it on the desk I look at it and see the problem right away.

""Sir, you're reservation is for the [Hotel] up the street. That's why I couldn't find it!"" I laugh.

The guest becomes sheepish and apologizes. I nod and smile. He continues to apologize to me on his way out. Right after he leaves I step back into the office area behind the desk.

""What an [redacted]!"" I say to my GM.""Sir, Your Reservation is for the [Hotel] Up the Street.""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"On mobile. I wandered in due to the YouTube community who read them out, but also to add to the ...”fun”

I work at a military hotel. These are hotels that are normally on a US Military installation or base overseas and has rules written by the parent branch (i.e Navy Lodge has rules by the Navy, Air Force Inns has rules from the Air Force, etc). Our rules are that we allow guests to bring their pets but with some restrictions, such as breed and pet type, as well as how many are allowed. Before, with manager approval, you could bring in extra pets, or exotic ones, but it was a case by case basis. 

Due to issues with some people bringing in more pets than they said, or the pets being obviously on the breed restriction list, our GM decided to only limit the number to two. And so comes my shift.

I was asked by our Front Desk Manager to call a guest as we turned over the shift due to a few other reasons with their pets, but also to inquire about them having one more than allowed. I got the husband on and the conversation went well for a bit until I mentioned the extra pet. 

Me: Yours Truly, G: Guest.

Me: So also, our housekeeper saw you have (x) number of dogs in your unit?
G: Yes. 
Me: Ok, so the limit for those is (x-1) number, so you will have to kennel one of the dogs. If you’d like, I have a list at the front desk for you. 
G: Oh, no, we’re putting one down. 
Me: .....oh. 
(My coworker confirmed that my brain had to load that info, and thus the ellipsis was embodied while I was on the phone )
Me: *currently thinking “what? WHAT???”* Are you sure about that? As I said, we have a list of kennels. 
G: No, I’m sure, we have to honor the rules and so one is going to be put down. 

I do not know if this man wanted me to say “nooo, not the puppy!” I don’t know if he knows I heard and can look up the type of dogs he has. I’m not even sure if he guesses I wanted to know if the dog was old and it was just his time. 
I do know that I called his bluff. I think. I’ll update when I can. 

Me: Alright sir, when that’s done please make sure to bring us the updated shots and rabies records for our records. Please keep us informed of this and remember (all other details mentioned before)
G: Ok got it.

So after all of that was done my coworkers asked the outcome. I told them. Then emailed my GM, Front Desk Manager, and Housekeeping. 
Our housekeeping manager came out in Shock within a minute of the email being sent.
Me: I just reported what he said!
Coworker: wait, doesn’t he have a camper?
Me: oh, yeah he does. 
Coworker: Why isn’t he living in that? It costs less and he can have all of the pets!
Me: I didn’t ask for the sordid details after “one will be put down” came up!

So now the man is not only on the shitlist with housekeeping due to some mess, but also because he tried to use the dog as emotional blackmail. 

Also until there’s more info I’ll have to keep everything very vague. This is not the weirdest thing to happen in our hotel, but even on military bases you get people trying to get out of things.Military Inn Tales: Too Many Dogs",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have been in the industry for three years now, as a full-time night auditor.  Like everyone else I've seen some shit.  Besides crazy insane stories, this also includes ignorance.  I often ask myself how guests have gotten to the spot they're in when they misunderstand very simple check-in routines and policies.  Now, that common general ignorance I get just slips right by. However, twice now, I've run into this situation that *really* makes me wonder how someone functions: 

I'm about an hour and a half into my night audit shift and I've only got four reservations left, and it's a slow night. Awesome.  Car pulls up, some young adults (mid-20s maybe?) pop out with some luggage.  Nice.  A check in.  They come in; the ""delegater"" if you will approaches the desk.  Check in starts like normal, she has two rooms; one for her and one for her two friends.  We'll call her NAT (Not All There). 

NAT: And can you make sure we have the best views of the mountains too? 

Me: Well I can see on your reservation that you booked standard non-view rooms. 

NAT: I did not! (She pulls up her confirmation e-mail, which doesn't have room type information which I find odd; however it does list the cheap rate she booked, which helped me determine she did not book mountain views) 

Me: I'm sorry that the confirmation email did not provide room type options, you may be able to find it on Blooking dot com through a link there, but otherwise, your current booking states KING rooms. 

NAT: Well can I upgrade one of the rooms to a mountain view?

Me: Yes, it'll be a $10 upcharge. 

So she agrees with the upcharge, battles her authorization somewhat because it was increased from her original quote because of the $10 daily upcharge for her room type upgrade, along with having to explain incidentals.  But everything is cleared after a few minutes, they ~~annoyingly~~ buy some snacks, and off they go for, I think in the moment, the rest of the night. 

Nah. I hear all three of them and the luggage cart from the elevator lobby a few minutes later.  Two of them wait by some benches near the elevator while NAT comes back to the desk. 

NAT: So... both of those rooms, are on the same side?  I thought you said we were getting a mountain view. I'd like to switch rooms to their side.  

Me: Uh... you were in rooms 812 and 819? (even room numbers are facing the mountains)

NAT: Yes? 

Me: Then you guys are on opposite sides of the hallway... even number rooms are facing the mountains. 

NAT: But there are no mountains outside of their window!  It's just a parking lot! 

Me: ...right... it's midnight.  It's dark out, and you won't be able to see the mountains.

NAT: We wanted to be able to take a picture, and now you're telling me there's not a mountain view?? 

Me: There is a mountain view.  There won't be if I move them to a room on your side.  The mountains aren't exactly *close* to us, so on any given night you won't see them when it's dark out.  

NAT: Uhh, do you have a picture of the mountain view or something? 

She still wasn't convinced, I opened up a photo from our website featuring a mountain view image from one of our rooms.  I showed it to her, and she goes ""yeah, we can't see that from the rooms"" and I have to remind her, ***again***, that on any given night when it's dark out, you won't see the mountains.  After some back and forth with me and her friends, they finally ""took the risk"" and went back upstairs.Guest expects a beautiful mountain view at midnight.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"In my small town there is a very similarly named property to the one I work at, like to-may-to to-mah-to similar. I get people all the time that are at the wrong one, but there was one in particular that left me a story worth telling. 

A Fred Durst look alike walks in with his girlfriend and their two teenage sons around 11:30PM

Me = me, NFD = Not Fred Durst, GF = his girlfriend

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

NFD: Yeah how much is a room for the night?

Me: Two beds will be [price] for the night, before tax.

NFD: For real? That's a lot man.

GF: I saw online that it was only [waaaaay lower price].

Me: I'm sorry but that must be for another property, there's no way I can go that low.

NFD: Well I only took out [less than price] from the atm.

Me: I couldn't take the cash anyway, I need either a credit card or a $250 cash deposit. 

NFD: What!? That's f-in bullshit, I ain't doing that. C'mon let's go. 

He and his family start leaving and as he walks through the door he shouts back ""BYE FELICIA!""

I'm used to this kind of interaction by this point so I just let it slide and get back to work. 

About half an hour after midnight they come back in.

GF: Yeah we just booked online for [waaaaay lower price] like we said. 

Me: Ok, well since it's after midnight the reservation will actually be for tomorrow night, but I should be able to check you in now and then back out in the morning. 

GF: Ah shit, ok.

I check for their reservation and its nowhere to be found. 

Me: I can't find your reservation, do you perhaps have the confirmation number?

GF: yeah its [obviously a confirmation number for another property]

Me: That didn't pull anything up either, do you have the confirmation email on your phone that I can look at?

GF: Sure, here you go.

Sure enough the reservation was for the To-may-to Inn and not the To-mah-to Lodge.

Me: It appears this reservation is for the motel up the road.

NFD: Ah f-! 

They start leaving again and NFD starts yelling at his girlfriend for getting it wrong and just as they're walking out the door I call out ""BYE FELICIA!""

His kids start shouting ""OOOOOOOOOOOH!"" and bust up laughing at him. He just hung his down and walked away without saying anything.Bye Felicia!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"this’ll be short. i came in to work the other day and am immediately told to go upstairs and take pictures of this room. okay...i’m thinking it’s for training purposes so i can learn the different types we have

I walk in and there’s shattered glass from the coffee table, blood all over the floor, missing sheets, an entire 24 pack of corona drank, the toilet lid has been ripped off the seat, and there’s an earring and fingernail on the floor. i take pictures and grab the earring and fingernail to bag and head back downstairs. 

apparently these guests checked in during third shift and left...who knows when because NO ONE saw them leave. and no guests were near their room last night so there were no noise complaints or anything. all very scary/strange! been in hotels for 2 years now, never witnessed anything like this.just call these guests spooky spice cuz no one knows what happened",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

So, this kid (I'm guessing 20yo) came to the FD asking about pizza delivery. This is a medium-size city, but it's poorly served with late night snacks options (specially on a Tuesday at 2AM). Luckily, there is *one* place that works 24h! I gave him the menu/flyer from the place (that has pizza, wings, subs, etc) and he asked if ""we"" could order now. I refused to believe that he was expecting me to order his food, but apparently that's what he wanted. I tried to be funny and said ""but I don't know what, darling! I might order some weird stuff that you won't like hahaha"" so I dialed and passed the phone to him - he didn't seemed impressed.        
         
Some 40min later, and he calls me, upset, asking if ""my food is still coming today?"" At this point he was so drunk I had to ask him to repeat the question 3 times to understand the slurred speech. With my patience gone, I just told him that I don't work for the pizza place, so I can't give any info about his order. He answered ""ok, you don't care, I get it!"" And hang up. At this very moment, the delivery guy walks in.

"Bit of a rant tonight, so this might not be up to my usual storytelling standards.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of the eternal desire of Man for the rules to somehow not apply to them.

So someone calls about thirty-odd minutes ago:

""Good evening, thank you for calling Lacking Tea in Town, this is Skwrl speaking, how may I help you?""

""Yeah, hey man, what do I need to check in?""

I groan inwardly, as I know full well what is going to happen. Psychic? No, just years of experience...

""Well, we require a government-issued ID and a credit card authorized for the *full* amount of the stay."" I emphasize the that last part, even though I know how this is going to go...

""So... I can't pay cash?""

Yep, here we go. ""You can, but we need to have a credit card on file, authorized for the full amount of the stay.""

""Oh... All of it needs to be on the card?""

""Yes, for the full amount of $XX tonight.""

""Um.. and that's checking out Wednesday, right?""

""No, that's checking out later today, Tuesday. Check-out is at noon. If you want to check out Wednesday, it's an additional night at $XX before tax.""

""But it's after midnight..?"" Arrgh I *hate* people who try and pull this particular crap.

""I'm sorry, but it's still Monday night. Check-in for Tuesday night is going to be at three pm.""

""Oh, okay... Let me think about it.""

Most of the time when someone says that, they're just being polite, and don't actually come in. Thus I am surprised when the caller comes in the door.

Jesus Tapdancing Christ... the *smell*. Weed is *legal* in this state, you don't need to smoke stuff that smells like gym socks soaked in stale bat urine! Get the good stuff! Ugh.

No matter. If he's baked, he shouldn't be driving, get him into bed.

""So... Uh.. what do I need?""

Whoa, deja vu. ""I'll need a driver's license and a card for the full amount of the stay.""

""Right, here you go.""

As expected, the card declines. Sigh.

""I'm sorry, but the card is declining. Do you have another one you can use?""

""Oh, can't I pay cash?""

""You can, but we need a card on file, authorized for the full amount of the stay."" This is the fifth time I've mentioned this, for those keeping track.

""Even when I'm paying cash?""

Arrgh. ""Yes. I don't know of any other hotel in town that doesn't. Maybe the Hotel With The Number, but I'm not certain. You may have to go to Nearby City."" 

Hotels in Nearby City start at one star and go downhill pretty fast. Advertising 'hourly rates', 'adult movies', and 'Color TVs'. Their Hotel With The Number is the *nice* hotel in town. But if any place will take cash...

To his credit, he never did the ""Oh, there's enough money on there try it again"" thing. He knew full well there was no way it would go through, but he was hoping I would just let it slide.

Sorry buddy, not tonight, and not when you're smelling strong enough we'd have to out the room out of service.

Hopefully he found a place that matches his expected level of service.

Edit: Huh. Just had another goober come in, wanting 'a really early check-in'. With an expected departure on Wednesday, of course. I told him that's not how it works, it's still Monday night, and he would need to pay for two nights. ""Oh, I don't wanna do that...""

"So I get called in early to work as I’m hanging out with family because a coworker called in (again) and since I can’t say no I said OK sure no problem. I should have said NO. When I arrived at 7pm (I was scheduled to work the night shift) I was greeted by cops and my coworker who explained that some guy was kicked out by this friends and the guy (drunk) was trying to retrieve his stuff from that room. Aside from that trope we were down to 2 rooms and nearly sold out. In the middle of dealing with the cops and that drunk my manager called and said to open up 4 rooms that had minor maintenance issues and to sell them at a discount. My coworker was dealing with that drunk with the cops but I was still posting checkins etc. under her shift because it was so hectic. By the time she logged out we sold those opened maintenance rooms and my boss was like WOW! open these others too. But ... I had to inspect them first to make sure they were rentable. Fine. However, besides that drunk there were other drunks and I was getting noise complaints etc. While dealing with all that I managed to check the rooms my boss said to open and 4 out of 9 were rentable which went within 30 mins. During that time that drunk reappeared on property, with 2 additional drunkmates, and I called the cops again to file a no trespass order against that drunk. The shifts had changed apparently with the cops because the ones who showed up had no idea of the calls before ... so I said X X this X that X and they scribbled appropriately and left. They managed to get that drunk off property without filing a no trespass order. In the confusion my coworker before me switched a double bed room due to a complaint and soon after we got a 3rd party reservation for a double bed room when we didn’t have one. So I called my boss and guess what he said open up X room from maintenance it should be okay. Up to that point I had checked all opened maintenance rooms to make sure they were rentable, but on the assurance of my boss and the volume of things I was dealing with I opened the room and checked them in without checking the room first. Huge mistake, admittedly on my part. The beds in the room were clean but had plumbing issues so whoever (maintenance) was dealing with it opted to throw 10+ towels in the bathroom rather than deal with the issue. Because we were so oddly busy and the steep discount we offered for these opened maintenance rooms the guests opted to stay. Throughout that night I was getting noise complaints and most were dealt with when I called the room. However I got several from one room as I was running around the hotel and when I went to check it was that drunk and when he opened the door a blast of weed smoke hit me so I said keep it down pretended I was his friend left then called the cops again and waited until they showed up. He was arrested finally. By that time it was nearly time for me to do audit (4am) at my property so I get that completed. I had about an hour of peace. Around 6 am one of that drunks comrades shows up (while dealing with that drunk earlier when he was carted off to jail his “friend” (the one who showed up at 6am) was escorted to a sobering house by the cops) and he lays a story on me at which point I ask for ID and he HAS a room with us but doesn’t know it. So I give him a key and he leaves, then returns a minute later saying his key isn’t working. When guests say that I ask “what color did the lights on the door flash when you inserted the key?” because red means an error, green means it’ll open, and orange means it’s dead bolted. I was not surprised when he said orange. We proceed to his room and I knock in case anyone will open. No answer. I knock again and hear a bit of noise so I wait. I hear the bolts being retracted etc. then out stumbles this mid-aged woman onto our courtyard who proceeds to take a piss on herself. I’m so annoyed at this point that I leave and tell the guy to deal with it and if I hear any complaints I will just ring our best friends the cops. I finish up the rest of my work and at 6:50 I get a frantic call from a room that some disabled lady they helped out the night before was screaming “all night” and banging on their door (their rooms were adjoining) and I needed to deal with it immediately. I go to the room in question and the woman has fallen out of her wheelchair, has deep red watery eyes, and has soiled herself, and I assumed drunk but it could have been a host of things. I tell her to remain calm and I will call for help at which point the other rooms husband walks out and starts yelling at me about how “all night” they were dealing with this and at that point I didn’t really care anymore and asked forcefully why they didn’t call me earlier and they said they had and I said bullshit, this is a medical emergency and if you had any knowledge of it and didn’t report it earlier, which they didn’t, there maybe an issue for them. The paramedics arrived shortly after and cleared the soiled lady ... she was just another drunk. As I waited for the paramedics I got treated to several rounds (as the MOD stood watch) of the incompetent neighbors laying out their corporate complaint strategy.

"Just a mini rant here. Mobile formatting, sorry desktop users.

Our pool hours are posted in multiple places and we inform guests of them at check-in. And yet I'll still come in for night audit and there will be people genuinely surprised that I'm showing up to kick them out and lock the door. I feel like I'm pretty nice about it too- the pool closes at 11 and I usually won't head over until 11:10-11:15. Sometimes the people in there simply didn't realize what time it was and they'll leave promptly. If they need to change or anything I'll say ""you know what no hurry I'll come back in 5 or 10 minutes so you don't feel rushed."" 

But SOMETIMES..... I've had guests just refuse to leave, or they try to beg me to keep it open. Usually drunk people. I can't stand it when I give them the old ""okay I'll be back in 5"" but then they haven't budged when I come back. Grown-ass adults will whine at me for 10 more minutes in the pool. Some nights it's bad enough that I want to tell them ""I'm not your mommy, if you need someone to drag you out by your ear then I'd be happy to call the police for you.""

"So, the hotel is getting all new furniture. That means we have to get rid of 100+ rooms-worth of dressers, tables, chairs, mirrors, lamps, etc... In their infinite wisdom management decided giving it all away was cheaper than paying someone to take it. 

I put up a Facebook ad saying “free furniture, please call and arrange a time to pick up. Bring a truck and people to load furniture, staff will not move furniture for you. First come first served, no holds”.  Now of course, about 80% of people who arranged a time never showed and people who didn’t call just showed up.  And almost everyone needed a hand hauling big, heavy shit to their compact cars. /eye roll

Locals had been coming in, and taking away stuff for about a week.  We actually cleared out all of the rooms we needed cleared. In comes two ladies in a U-haul a full 7 days after I took the ad down. 

“We are here for furniture.  We called and said we would be here today.” They announced. 

Ok, well... sorry ladies I think most every thing has been taken already, but I will have someone meet you in the rear of the building to show you what’s left. 

Cue:

“We made an appointment to pick up three dressers! You better still have them! We rented a truck!”

So they go out back for a bit.  Shortly thereafter, our poor Maintenance Dude, who has been saddled with slinging all this furniture down to the ungrateful masses, comes to the desk. 

“Those ladies are pissed! There is only one dresser and they just cursed me out for not having more. They just asked me to reimburse them for the u-haul.” He, obviously told them ‘no’ and then came to the desk to tell me so we could laugh at them. 

Unfortunately, the laughter was cut short by the ladies walking back in the front door. 

“Give me a job application.”

Fuckin’ A. 

It wasn’t even a question, or a request. It was a demand, and rudely stated at that. 
 
My instinct was to say no, but then I had a thought: we have a Do Not Rent list, how about a Do Not Hire list?

I hand them two applications, which they fill out right then and there after demanding two pens.  

After they left, I broke out a big red sharpie, wrote “NEVER HIRE” in big letters and put the apps on the GM’s desk.

Then he’s like let me be frank with u... and launches into this whole story for thirty minutes about how at our sister property two months ago a FDA told him he could have a suite there with his guests and could bring light snacks and that he could bring in his own 80 inch flat screen to watch the super bowl game on and could bring in furniture like sofas from other rooms for his guests. Well when he goes to call and book this the MOD is like okay um what no?? How many people? Dude now says TWENTY FIVE. 


MOD is like no dude u can’t have 25 people in a room and we don’t allow parties in our hotel rooms. They refer him to sales and sales tells him he can book an event space and they come up with a plan but he never corresponds back with them about booking. Two days ago the dude books the suite and two connecting rooms advance purchase non refundable thinking he pulled one over on us. 


So we call him and tell him no, cancel his suite, and tell him we can use his deposit for an event space and we can do catering from the bistro. Dude is pissed bc he already ordered  A THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD from an outside catering company that’s non refundable!! but our policy is we don’t allow outside caterers. So he comes over to my hotel today and idk who he is bc obviously I didn’t get the memo. And is like please work something out for me? I’m like um no promises but I’ll speak with upper management... Apparently he knows our GM and name drops her asks if we can put him in contact with her. I say no she’s on vacation (which is true, she’s on vacation staying at our hotel)!

Tells her the situation and how he’s been done wrong and that he has made his attorney aware bc “this just isn’t fair.” 


She comes in the back office and tells me “let the guest know leadership will reach out to them today” So I go to the restaurant and pull up a chair and see how their meal is and tell him just that. THE MAN STARTS CRYING and so does his wife!!! In the middle of the restaurant.  I’m dying no no no no!! He’s like “I just wanted a super bowl party with my friends and y’all are being really unfair depriving me of that. I’m not a party animal I’m just a prestigious older gentleman who wants to have some important friends for wings and the game. This is really important to me :( “  all while weeping into his linen napkin. YIKES.A grown man cried on me today bc he couldn’t have his super bowl party in a hotel room",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So I had a call today from a high tier super shiny snowflake member. He calls to order room service and when I tell him the total he bitches about the price. I explain that there is a delivery charge, in room dining service charge, and then taxes on his order. Now our in room dining service charge is 17% and the delivery charge is a flat $3. I think this is an industry standard because every single property I've both worked at and stayed at has these charges, and they're all quite close to this. These charges are also in our collective bargaining agreement and cannot be waived. He wanted the manager on duty, and I transferred him over to her. 

Now the company I work for uses a system where every single case is imputed into a computer database, and we can see the cases from other properties of the same company. This guy appears to always order room service, and then bitch about his service charge and delivery charge and because he's a super shiny snowflake member. Well looking in the system he appears to pull this at every single property. All the previous properties comped his meal. My manager let him know that he's more than welcome to order a pick-up from the restaurant or eat at the restaurant, but we would not comp his room service meal. He wasn't too happy, but when there are 20 cases last year of complaining about this exact same thing somebody has to take a stand. She even used that when she talked to him, and he wasn't happy. He denied having complain about that, and no hotel ever charged him delivery charges and room service charges when he ordered room service.

"This bothered me enough to post about it. I work the night shift at an extremely seedy hotel. Jobs are hard to come by in this city and you take what you can get. I am a female and last night when I got in, I was privy to this disgusting conversation. My coworker that I was relieving, we will call him X, was filling me in on what went down and what I needed to know. A long term stay guest comes to the desk with a full six pack and a couple extra beers. This is the exact conversation that took place;

Guest: Hey, I need a room key. I left mine at my coworkers place

X: Sure, how was the game?

Guest: It was ok. I wasted money on this six pack for my coworker. I was hoping to get lucky but she claimed she was tired and sent me home

X: Oh man

Guest: Yeah, next time I'll get my money's worth

Me: *unable to sit there silently* Are you kidding me right now? That has to be the rape-iest thing I've ever heard. *Turning to X* Make him his key so he can get his moneys worth here. Go to bed and spare the women of this city. GOODNIGHT!

He's there for another 3 days and then he's gone. All of the staff is female with the exception of X and if he's gonna act like that with a co-worker, imagine what he would do to a stranger.""I'll get my money's worth""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Was reminded of this story when I read another on here, it happened a couple of months ago.

&amp;nbsp;

I was finishing a night shift I was filling in for our sick night manager, and was handing over to the MOD arriving for 1st shift in the back office while their FDA manned the desk. We hear someone approach the desk and start going off, so the new MOD goes out to dive on the live grenade someone just rolled into our bunker.

&amp;nbsp;

Idiot: I'm a Super Snowflake member with your hotel and that girl in there is refusing to provide me with my complimentary breakfast! Does this hotel even know what Super Snowflake MEANS???

&amp;nbsp;

MOD: Oh dear! That's not acceptable at all. May I please have your surname and room number, sir? I can get this addressed for you.

&amp;nbsp;

Idiot: Oh no, I'm not staying here. My wife and I just came in for our free breakfast.

&amp;nbsp;

MOD: Oh, so sorry sir, you will receive your member benefits in our restaurant when you stay with us. Unfortunately we do not offer complimentary breakfast without a room reservation.

&amp;nbsp;

Idiot: Sounds like you haven't been trained properly either! This hotel is ridiculous. I - AM - A - SUPER - SPECIAL - SNOWFLAKE - MEMBER (clapping between words, literally). Go and get the manager.

&amp;nbsp;

MOD: I am the manager, sir. I am also a Super Special Snowflake member and it is clear in the terms and conditions that you will only receive your benefits with a room reservation. You would be welcome to burn points to spend on your breakfast, but we will not be providing complimentary breakfast this morning.

&amp;nbsp;

Idiot: Is this how you treat your Super Snowflake members? I'm not stupid! I've read the terms! GIVE - US - OUR - FREE - BREAKFAST (more clapping).

&amp;nbsp;

MOD: Sir, I have taken the liberty of bringing up the terms and conditions of our Super Snowflake tier, you are welcome to take a look (turns screen around to face the idiot)

&amp;nbsp;

Idiot: This is outrageous! We're never coming back here! What's your name? I'll be calling the CEO about this! (they're not even based in the country we operate in)

&amp;nbsp;

The MOD hands the idiot his business card and welcomes him to send an email to our GM, whose card was also provided. Idiot storms off and nobody receives any emails and we were never contacted by our CEO.

"I work in a very busy hotel that has a few hundred rooms and tend to deal with guests who feel very entitled. I've worked in hotels for about 7+ years now, &amp; three years or so at the Front Desk at all classes of hotels (value, conference, luxury, beach, resort, etc). I'm one of the senior FDA that we have on our team. I know what I'm doing and I am definitely not a rookie. 

I arrived at work long before the Sun even thought about gracing our presence for the day. I had not even a chance to get through half my coffee before Lord fuckwad &amp; accompanying Karen came to the front to checkout in the morning. I am not a morning person by any means and they decided to want to harass my female coworker &amp; it was too early for that shit. I finish with my guest and go over to give her a hand. 

They had their bill emailed to them, but it didn't have the room rate listed on it. Already knew what the answer was going to be before I even looked at it. They claimed they booked it through our site, actually booked through a 3rd party. 
Guest: ""Why can't we see our room rate? You didn't put it on my bill. You trying to hide something?"" 
Self: ""Unfortunately sir, this reservation was booked through a 3rd party so your room &amp; tax has been paid for ahead of time through them. This bill will only show what you charged to your room. To see your room rate you need to check the enail they sent you.""
G: ""You're wrong. Definitely was booked through you. You must be new or not know what you're doing. I've traveled all around the world and stay in VERY nice hotels all the time (you can now hear my eye roll).""
S: ""Sir, your bill will only show your parking and that's it. You booked through Smriceline, they will have your invoice on the email they sent to you. What we see on our side is not what what you're paying for R&amp;T.""
G: ""Are you the manager? I need to speak to the manager.""
S: I put on my best shit eating grin possible for it being that ungodly earning the morning and them making me put up with their BS. Our managers are in their morning meeting, and will be for sometime. ""I'll be happy to call to the back for you and see if they can give you any assistance."" 

We only have the one person answering phones in the back, and they're the supervisor. I go and trade places with her for a second. She's not even out there for two minutes before they're back.

Super: ""Yeah, they're an idiot. I told them exactly the same thing you told them and they magically found their email from Smriceline with the bill on it before they stormed off. Sit and finish your coffee. Thank you for not chewing their head off.""

"EDIT: So after reading your guys' advice and getting more information from the hotel, I have decided to file for wrongful dismissal. Thank you all for your advice and kind words!

So hey, not 100% sure this belongs here, but it is a crazy tale from the front desk?

Alright, so to make a long story short, my GM is... interesting. Everyone I work with agrees. Tries to buy your loyalty with expensive gift cards, food, gifts, to make you do her dirty work (aka, write reports outlining everything bad about your supervisor or coworker does, for example, or make you clean her office or do her paperwork when it's clearly not in your job description.)

So one day, I said no to writing up a journal about my supervisor, because hey, I'm not like that. And all hell broke loose. 

One morning, a client tried to check in at 10am. Checkouts are at 11 and we were full house when it came to standard bed rooms. I explained that to him and offered him a full price upgrade (because I had always been told not to manually change prices), but he wouldn't budge. I then offered to call him as soon as the room was ready as well as ask for it to be done as quick as possible, but he wanted it right this instant and said he was gonna go to another hotel. There was nothing I could really say, so I told him I was sorry to see him go and that if he changed his mind I would be keeping his reservation active until 4pm (check-in time), and then cancel it for free.

GM was standing behind me for the whole conversation, but did not say a word. After he left, she came out of her office and told me about how unacceptable my behaviour was and la dee da. Well, alright then, I think, and get on with my day.

At 2:45PM, 15 minutes before my shift ends, I get called into her office and handed the papers that state that I was fired without prior notice. Now, I was unionized, so this shouldn't happen, but she said that me ""turning the client away"" was ""akin to stealing from the company"", so she had every right to fire me without prior notice. My jaw dropped to the floor. Funny thing was, they already had a replacement trained and lined up to take my position the day after. Not to fall into crazy conspiracy theories here, but I'm starting to wonder if that was even a real client to begin with...

So hey, moral of the story is, it's not just the guests that are insane. Thanks for the good stories around here people, it was a fun ride, but this event just marked the end of my tourism career. If you guys are ever in a situation where you feel manipulated by your bosses or where they ask you for impossible stuff, dont be naive like me and take it as appreciation.

Me; Good evening sir, how can I help you?

OM; Checking in.

Me; Alright sir what's your last name?

OM; Lastname, Firstname.

Me; Thank you, let me get the reservation pulled up.

*Searches last name; no reservation. Searches first name; no reservation. Searches future reservations; no reservation. Searches company wide incase he's at the wrong hotel which happens often; no reservation.*

OM; Jesus f@$%ing christ are you serious?

Me; I'm sorry, I know it's frustrating but hopefully the name was just misspelled, but in order to search for your reservation it would be faster with a confirmation number.

OM; I made this reservation MYSELF I know I spelled my own name right, search again.

Me; Sir, I've already searched that. Perhaps you have the email I can look at to see the confirmation number?

OM; *grumbling obscenities while aggressively scrolling through his inbox* This is f@%^ing stupid, I know I'm at the right hotel.

Me; You're sure you booked your reservation with Murray Plaza in ThisCity?

OM; YES I'M SURE YOU STUPID B%$#H IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU CAN'T F#$%ING FIND IT. *finally pulls up the email which is for the Schmyatt Place literally 40 feet away from my hotel*

Me; *dying inside with laughter trying to keep the smile off my face* I'm sorry sir, it appears you're at the wrong hotel. This room is booked at the Schmyatt Place right next door to us, not at this property. People mistakenly come in here all the time .

OM; Are you f@#$ing serious? How the f@#$ am I supposed to get there? 

Me; If you go down this hallway to my left, there is an exit door and the entrance to their hotel is literally right in front of the exit. 

OM; *red in the face sweating and cursing to himself while dragging his bag behind him to the hotel literally right next door*

I just had a potential customer call and ask about smoking rooms. I explain to him that while the motel does have smoking rooms, none of them are currently clean.

He continues with: ""well, if I book it online and list myself as requesting a smoking room, you have to clean one for me, right?""

"Recently, we've been told to crack down on giving out the government rate at the front desk.  A lot of people take advantage &amp; book on weekends to get a cheap room, even bring their kids on a ""work"" trip.  We now have to inform guests that we need a written letter from their employer stating that they are in fact traveling for business purposes to be able to give them the rate.  We even have a print out with the statement highlighted from the government website, you know, for the difficult guests...  This crack down has only been in effect for less than a week. 

I had a guest on the phone asking to get the government rate for next weekend.  Now, we especially need that letter on weekends because that's when people take advantage the most.  When I mentioned the letter she was baffled.  

""I was there not too long ago &amp; only had to show my work ID..."" she said.  

I let her know that our government rate policy had only changed recently.  With this response she got pretty pissy with me real fast &amp; I wasn't about dealing with her attitude when I'm just trying to do my job.  She began to threaten to take her business elsewhere, as customers do &amp; book online to get cheaper rates through 3rd party websites.  Just goes to show she's wanting to take advantage, which is exactly the behaviour we're trying to avoid.  I decided to be as nice as possible &amp; said, ""You're welcome to do that if you wish."" Because well, she is.  There was a pause &amp; she went on to thank me for my ""help"".  I chippered up &amp; said, ""You're welcome!  Bye!"" And hung up. 

What I regret is forgetting to mention the statement from the government website with this policy.  It's in the terms &amp; conditions of every government employee.

Me: okay that's no problem, will you be using cash or another card for the room?

Boss: hello there how are you today

Guest: okay it's been a long day. My significant other just got out of surgery and we spent all our money there. I have this gift card and have never been to a hotel that doesn't accept it.

Boss: *explains the liability of needing a valid card for the security deposit*

Guest: well you can try to charge it on the gift card

Boss: well considering the circumstances you do seem like a nice person and I can make an exception this time. *the gift card declines* oh... It doesn't look like there was enough on the card. Do you know anyone who could cover the deposit? We can take another card.

Guest: let me check. *leaves office*

-boss goes back and I check in the guest with their SO's cc. It goes through, I instruct the guest where to go and he grabs a few of our business cards with a lackluster 'thanks'-

Cut to today and I am going through online reviews and see a negative one pop up. I look and this very same guest left a negative review so exaggerated it got me boiling. Basically came down to the only thing good is that guest didn't get killed and the worst was everything else with mine and my boss's name mentioned specifically as the worst human being alive that have ever come into existence. 

Are you freaking kidding me?!?! You not only have the audacity to use a gift card for room payment which was given an exception despite the OTA saying you need a real cc for the required specified deposit, give us a sob story and me flak during check in. You leave a negative review for what most would consider an act of kindness?? We didn't have to check you in or keep your reservation. You even got the okay from my boss that we could cancel your reservation without any fees! There are at least 7 different locations around us that don't need a deposit or cc. Wtf!

Housekeeping forgot towels in one room and didnt have any others cleaned.
Lightbulbs were missing from another. Presumably stolen. Luckily we managed to find two in the office. 
Young children screaming up and down the halls and their parents did fuck all, probably something i ought to get used to...
Got yelled at because of the noise as my manager was telling people to stfu but the man didnt listen to me saying that and was livid, apologized but what can i do? It was in the process of being taken care of.
We were threatened with lawyers because a kid got a cut that was barely more than a scrape in the pool. We discounted half off the room but he smirked and threatened the lawyer to try to get more out of us but we were all okay go ahead. He left and came back today to try again with a different fda
A lady came to tell us a painting was mia from her room but it wasnt her so please dont think shes a thief... okay thanks for the heads up...
A boy was punching a picture and i guess my face is scary because when i looked at him he hightailed it out of there.
I could hear girls screaming at eachother because half ignored posted rules about the pool and the other half followed rules. Yes i kicked them out numerous times
Apparently there were ants in a room so we moved them

"I used to work for a professional services team with about 16 people in the office, all led by John Smith, the owner. It happened that John and I were the only two guys working there. When people called us it would ring at the main switchboard downstairs, depending on who the caller asked for it could be routed to a specific extension, or if it was a general call or they didn't know who they wanted it would ring every extension and whoever was available would pick it up - it was our own, team specific front desk.

At least twice a day I would answer the phone with the following: ""thank you for calling the Smith group, this is **Mark,**"" to which the caller would reply ""hi, John,"" ""John?"" or my personal favorite, ""is Mark short for John?,"" which happened at least once a week.

The next day I believe the Housekeeping Manager came to us at the desk and said ""who gave my cellphone number to someone asking for a job?"" BIG NO NO. I don't know if my Manager ever figured out who gave out her phone number, but I thought most people knew not to give out personal information to strangers. 

Fast forward to today. A very French woman asked for the HSKP Manager. Then I realized it was her again. I speak French but even I had a hard time understanding her. She said that she applied online and no one called her for an interview. Okay, maybe we're not hiring? I keep telling her that she needs to talk to the HSKP Manager, and she wasn't listening. She kept going on about how she worked at a nice hotel in Montreal and she really wants a job with us. Okay, you. Have. To. Talk. To. HOUSEKEEPING. 

AND THEN SHE CALLED AGAIN. 6 times today! 

At this point I was fed up and called the Manager myself. I told her that it was this woman again, and she told me to just keep deterring her, say that we might not be hiring.

In August I lost my job at the Worst Eastern. It wasn't my final hotel gig but we will get there... I got fired from Worst Eastern. The reasons were murky and stupid but boiled down to a bunch of shit that actually had nothing to do with work. Come join me on my journey of bullshit!

\-I separated from my ex husband 2 years ago. The only people I really initially told about this was my boss and my now boyfriend. This is important, keep that in your brain.

\-My now boyfriend and I get called into the office  A YEAR after we started seeing each other when my boss figured out we were dating. This wasn't against company policy at all but we got ""written up"" (i.e we never saw anything or signed anything) for other bullshit excuses like having a water bottle at the desk, being late or having our cell phones near us at all. We were then off the record accused of selling drugs to our co-workers, him sexually harassing me and being drunk at work every day and I think stealing. None of these things were remotely true. My BF worked at that property for over 10 years and someone who could be a female GM had a problem with him being with me, personally, not company policy. No one else had any issue with it. She literally told him I was wasting his life and to leave me. Okaaaaaay.

\-fast forward we got a new co-worker. I am nothing if not a believer in the good of people so I tried to make friends with this new co-worker even if he was obviously a narc and thought he knew EVERYTHING when he knew nothing. I believe if rumors are correct he's been dismissed for refusing to wear his tie and doing NOTHING while on desk, but before that my GM decided to tell him about my personal situation and the fact that my BF and I were dating while I was legally separated but not divorced made this dude uncomfortable. He wouldn't have even known I was seeing my bf if my GM hadn't told him. He had also found TFTFD and told her about it. He tampered with the time clock by offering to clock people in and out so they could go home early and my BF got blamed for it.

\-As a result of all this, and I hope you're reading this, you fucking narc asshole who's job I made easier by trying to get everyone else to like you because no one else was even going to make the effort, my BF and I both got fired for in my case ""poor job performance and making XXXX uncomfortable"" and the list of shit they came up with that my boyfriend ""did"" was ridiculous. Also apparently we and only us two were making fun of our GM here on reddit. I assure you that didn't happen. Did I bitch about customers? Yeah? Management, not really. And before anyone tells me what an idiot I am, all my coworkers used reddit, so anyone who left themselves logged in that read this sub could have been why they even knew what my screen name was.

\-After that I went to work at a Patel Hotel for exactly 11 days. In that time frame I was sexually harassed by both of my male co-workers, jumped by a guest because I was supposed to count BBQ tools in the dark at 1030pm at night and of course the management did nothing. I was also robbed by the housekeeping on the first day I was told I could no longer have my purse at the front desk. I lost my sunglasses, all the cash in my wallet and my boyfriend's high school class ring (which is even worse since we've both been out of high school for over 20 years) on the day I was told I couldn't wear it at work anymore. I walked out the next day because they were going to write me up for having a box cutter on me to  I don't know cut boxes of breakfast food because the housekeeping / breakfast staff literally sat in the back doing nothing every time I worked mornings and oh right I got jumped two nights before...

\-God, Buddha, Whatever came for me and my boyfriend though. My boyfriend graduated college with his AA in IT and Networking and has had an awesome job in that field for the last 4 months. In December I started working in a deli which doesn't sound like a lot but I've always wanted to cook for a living and this is a start. It's union job, I get insurance, lunch breaks, discounts and I make as much as I did at the hotel. They also do not care about my tattoos, piercings, hair, or what I wear to work aside from I have to wear a collared shirt and my apron. I get double time on holidays and its two streets from my house.

The point of this post is I miss my hotel buddies but also to remind you, if your hotel life falls apart, there is light on the other side. You can find something that treats you better and pays more, even when it feels like you're working in hell or going through it, the light at the end of the tunnel isn't always a fucking train.

A very nondescript-looking lady came to check out of her room.

Me: Good morning, how has your stay been?

Guest: Well.. I think somebody came into my room during the night.

Me: oh that doesn’t sound good, did you see  or hear anyone enter the room?

Guest: no

Me: have you provided anyone else with a key to your room? 

Guest: no

Me: OK, can you explain what gives you the impression that someone entered your room?

I should also point out that her room was on an upper floor and the windows do not open. 

Guest: well there’s some stuff in my bag which wasn’t there before.

Me: that seems very unusual, what kind of things? 

Guest: there’s an umbrella in my bag.. I definitely didn’t pack my umbrella, and there’s some money which wasn’t there before.

Me: so you’re saying you believe somebody entered your room during the night and put money IN your bag? 

Guest: I know it sounds a little far-fetched..

At this point my HHK has moved away from the desk to laugh.

Guest: do you have any CCTV?

Me: sadly it doesn’t cover the hallways, only the reception and car park.

Guest clearly doesn’t believe me, so I rotate the CCTV monitor so she can see for herself.

Guest: ok, well what else can you do? 

Me: I can check the access history on the door as it’s a digital lock, and find out which keys have been used on it, but this isn’t a quick process so can I call you when I’ve had a look?

Guest agrees to leave her number and heads off.

I audit the lock, to humour her and cover my own ass, and of course the only uses were by the guest when she entered the room, and by hk who entered after she checked out. 

When querying her booking I found that she was a walk-in. Why is it always the walk-ins??The Tale of The Reverse Burglary",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tonight's been an interesting one. Between making a couple mistakes and dealing with a dance party who came in to take pictures in front of our staircase, I haven't had a lot of time to myself. So when the phone rang, I'll be honest, I was grateful that I could talk to someone.

At my not-so-little Schmoliday Out, we sell out for the big events at Randomcollege University like football games, Parents' Weekend, and graduations, and we sell out early, so if someone makes a booking and screws up, they may be SOL before they have a chance to fix it. Tonight, it wasn't a guest who screwed up, but the worse-than-useless central office.

I got a call a couple hours ago from a central reservations agent who fessed up to making a mistake and changing a reservation to a date the day after the guest's graduation, making it useless. I couldn't do anything about it, so I told her to call back--- BLIP BLIP BLIP... call waiting. I wrap up the call I'm on and take the new one. It's the guest who Central shafted. She right off the bat asks for a manager, I mention I'm MOD, and that our regular manager would be in Monday. She asks if I can help her with her reservation, saying the person at Central screwed it up. Now, the Central person didn't mention this, but she'd also cancelled two of the reservations. Yippee. Now I break the news to a less-than-thrilled guest, who starts cursing out Central. I kinda drop my professionalism mask and agree since this isn't the first time this has happened. And get this: the Karen wasn't a Karen at all. To me, she was a total Glinda. Which warmed my heart. After confirming the mistakes that were made and verifying the changes were made at the Central level, she hangs up, but not before thanking me for staying on the line with her.

Sometimes the ones we think are going to be Almira Gulch on PMS turn out to be Glinda. I love it when that happens.Central Shafts Woman Out of Graduation Rooms",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Excuse me if this is jumbled, I'm typing this out while working the morning shift on the Sunday after a sold-out weekend, so I've been dealing with a lot of check-outs and making change for a lot of people who, kindly, want to leave tips for our housekeepers and the cook for our complimentary breakfast. 

This story is from yesterday, the Saturday in the middle of a sold-out weekend. Most of our guests this weekend were in town for a local event, and we're well-known for being lenient with our check-in time (i.e., if your room is ready we will let you check in early) and so for events like this, and for weddings, we always have hoards of people wanting to check in early and we do our best to accommodate them. 

However, Friday night we had 36 out of 38 rooms occupied, and on Saturday I had 7 check-outs and 9 arrivals. Check-out is at 11am. I had a hoard of guests wanting to check in by 9am. Housekeeping comes in at 8am. You do the math. 

The first two people who requested early check-in were easily accommodated, because like I said we had two vacant and clean rooms from the previous day. I hadn't even assigned rooms or made keys by then so I just did it as I went. After that though, I was fully prepared to give out my little speech about check-ins: ""We guarantee your room and a speedy check-in by 3pm, and allow early check-ins based upon room availability at the requested time of check-in. Unfortunately I do not have any rooms ready at the moment, but if you'd like to have some coffee or help yourself to some breakfast and wait in the lobby for a few minutes I'll be happy to let you know when one becomes available."" 

This usually works pretty well for me, but my coworker, who is the cook for breakfast and sometimes fills in at the desk, jumped in almost every time and told the guests directly that I could go check on housekeeping and let them know someone was here to check in to speed up the process. 

Ummm.... No, I can't? 

First of all, I am NOT going to rush housekeeping. They already truck right along at what is, as far as I'm concerned, a lightning-fast pace and rushing them will only annoy them and make them start to miss stuff, which will then make it so I have to fix anything they miss when I inspect the room before I put a guest in it, inevitably making the point moot anyway.  

Secondly, you're absolutely insane if you come into a hotel and expect to be able to check in before 90% of the guests from the night before have even checked out. Just totally bonkers. To me a reasonable early check-in is like. 1pm when standard check-in time is 3pm. If you want to check in at friggin 9am you might as well just stay the night before because I probably can't help you. 

But I wasn't even mad at any of the guests in this scenario because they were all perfectly respectful and polite, and I have no doubt that had I asked them to wait they would have been fine with it. I was annoyed with my co-worker for saying that to the guests directly, so that I had to then go report to housekeeping that someone wanted to check in as if they weren't already doing their jobs. Of course I told them to take the time they needed to do it right, and if the guests had to wait then they'd friggin wait. 

I so wanted to say something, but I didn't want to contradict her in front of guests, especially since knowing her she would have argued it. Technically I do outrank her when I'm running the desk, but I hate to pull the rank card and pretty much just told guests even after I checked with housekeeping that it would be a few minutes and I'd let them know when they could check in. 

Just pushed my buttons lol.Time to bitch about a co-worker",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello FDAs. A shorter tale today coming from my independently owned 100 room property.

I arrived for shift 2 just a few minutes before 3 pm to find shift 1 checking in an elderly man who is insistent that he needs the room to watch the Super Bowl. 

Of course the super bowl isnt today but this isnt a conversation either of us were gonna have with the man. 

Shift 1 clocks out and I take over. The man comes back to the lobby and rather aggressively exclaims that his keys dont work. I apologize and recant the keys, as our keys are known to deactivate frequently. 

He however returns, and is very upset that I gave him nonfunctional keys. His room is just next to the office so I walk down with him, as he could not give a coherent response as to what exactly wasnt working. 

I reach the door and find that this man is using a business card from some other business as a key. I dont know how this was possible, because he handed me his keys the first time they didnt work, so clearly he knew they were keys. 

The real kicker is he wanted a discount because he was ""missing the superbowl"" which as aforementioned, is tomorrow. 

TL;DR Boomer gets mad that a random business card doesnt function as a key and that the superbowl isnt on today, makes it my problem.That isnt a key, sir.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So,, it's still pretty early for a Saturday night. The bars here don't close down until 3:30 tonight but this girl is already toast.

Starts off with the call. She wants a jacuzzi suite. I offer her what I have, which is a smoking Jacuzzi suite at $150. No! She needs a non smoking. I tell her I don't have a non smoking jacuzzi tonight so she asks for the price of a standard non smoking (which is about half the cost.) I tell her that rate and she asks if she can have the non smoking jacuzzi for that price. I again inform her that Unfortunately I do not have a non smoking jacuzzi tonight, and would not be able to sell the jacuzzi I have available at that rate. She huffs says fine, and that they're pulling in to the parking lot. (Yay!)

They come up to the entrance which of course is locked at night. I can hear the chick shrieking about it before they notice the big assed sign, key reader, and buzzer. They finally figure it out and get to the desk. 

Her: We're drunk! You're really not going to sell us a jacuzzi room? Most people like us! (of course I highly highly doubt that.)

Me: I'll absolutely sell you my smoking jacuzzi suite for the $150 I quoted. 

Her: Well is it non smoking?

Me: It's not. My non smoking jacuzzi is not available tonight.

Her: Well, does it smell like smoke? 

Me: I mean, it probably does...

Her: is the pool open?

Me: It's not. Unfortunately it closes at 11pm.

Her: God... Lighten up! What's gonna happen if I go swimming? oooh, am I going to get in trouble?

Me: Well, it automatically locks down so that won't be a possibility. (total lie but it's easier to lie at this point.)

Her: Well,, can't I have a key? 

Me: Your room key will work during pool hours, unfortunately I don't have another key to give you that will work.

Her: Are the people in the non smoking jacuzzi awake?

Me: Ok, here's your key, (insert breakfast hours and direct them to the elevator.) Enjoy your stay!

Y'all….  I've been drunk and I've been stupid but jfc.. drunk girls drive me up the freakin wall. I do feel slightly bad though because between all the back and forth I didn't notice I was still on the jacuzzi room when I authorized her card so woops,, I did what I could to correct it but you know how that goes.

I also had to run down and reprogram the pool door so she can't get in if she tries.Saturday night drunk chicks",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I used to work the front desk at a local gym when I was in high school. I have MANY vivid memories of the encounters I’ve had, which gave me many stories to tell in the future. This one I’m particular isn’t necessarily funny but it was very confusing and frustrating for me to deal with. 

So there was this incredibly ripped lady who always came into the gym with her husband during my shift. I would greet them and the husband would say hi and smile at me and his wife would often ignore me. Tbh I was always scared of her. She was ripped and had this permanent look on her face that looked like she wanted to rip anybodies head off. After the end of one of her workouts, her husband left to go start the car(and wait in it cuz he didn’t come back inside) and the ripped lady(from this point forward will be referred to as RL) came up to the front desk.

RL slammed her phone on the desk and slid it towards me. She didn’t say anything to me and I saw on her phone that there was a video of her doing pull-ups. I didn’t know what she wanted from me and when I looked back up at her she had her usual murder face on. 

Me: Cool, your form is pretty good! One day I’ll get to that point to haha!

RL didn’t say anything. Her arm was still outstretched, holding onto the phone the pushed towards me. I wasn’t sure what she wanted with me and me and her ended up just staring at each other for a good 30 seconds as 16 year old, socially awkward me tried to figure out what to say to her. 

Me: ...Do you need any help with anything?

RL continued to stare at me, not changing her stance at all. I was getting very confused the longer it went on and asked if she wanted me to do anything with the video, like posting it on the gym’s Facebook page or something. She continued to stare at me, as if she wanted me to read her mind but i can’t read minds so it was just a lot of awkward silence. 

Finally, she spoke. 

RL: I didn’t film this 

Me:oh ok...did your husband?

She stared at me longer, this time she squinted her eyes and dragged her phone back towards her. 

RL: No

Me: Oh Uhm ok. Who did then?

RL: What are you going to do about this?

I was slowly starting to realize that someone might have recorded her without her permission but I wasn’t for sure. She could’ve set the phone up somewhere or had a friend record. It would’ve been much easier trying to figure out what she wanted if she communicated instead of trying to talk to me telepathically. 

Me: Did someone take be video without your permission?

RL: Do you have Facebook?

Me:....no I don’t. Sorry 

RL sighed annoyingly. She was slowly getting more pissed and I had no idea why. She refused to actually tell me what’s happening 

Me: Can I help you do something with the video?

RL: Find the guy who recorded it and take it down

Finally I was getting some answers.

Me: I can try to help but I can’t guarantee I can get be video down. You might have to contact the user who posted it and ask him to take it down. If you have a physical description or name I can contact the manager so that she can use the gym’s Facebook to ask him to remove the video and we can fix this problem :) 

RL sighed heavily and angrily. Then she walked out the door....I called after her asking if she wanted to give me the name and she didn’t respond. I told my manager and she said to not worry about it anymore since we had no way of fixing the problem. After that day I never saw RL again. I saw her husband but never her. I never found out if she just came in when I wasn’t working or went to a different gym altogether after that. I just wish she had used her words because she was not disabled in any way, just quiet. My manager had talked to her husband often and he said that she’s just super quiet. Also never found if the video was ever removed. 

Overall, it was a confusing timeI can’t help you if you don’t use words",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hi guys. It absolutely blows my mind that I'm (still) dealing with idiots who smoke in a non-smoking room/hotel and expect to get away with it.

At my last property, we accepted cash at check in. This included a $200 cash security deposit to cover any damages. The rooms were accessible from the outside so if someone wanted to smoke they could easily open their door and step out. 

We also had smoking rooms available, believe it or not.

One morning, a guest came to the desk ready to check out of a **non-smoking** room. A half naked woman (presumably a stripper or escort of some kind) requested the $200 cash security deposit. 

I excuse myself and proceed to inspect the room for any sign of damage/missing items. 

It's **definitely** smokey. A half full water bottle with some black liquid floating in the bottom is on the dresser. 

The half naked guest is now joined by her male companion at the front desk.

""I can't give you your security deposit back. Someone smoked in the room.""

Rage ensues. Dispute after dispute. Excuses. 

""We just got back from the club"" was my personal favorite. 😏

The guy is a terrible liar. He's not convincing and is fighting a grin while denying the smoking. 

I explain that they'll have to speak with the manager regarding the deposit. I present his business card.

The guy then proceeds to violently rake all of the items on the front desk onto the floor. They storm out together but not before making a scene. They call me a ""racist"" about 10 times and tip our flower planters by the entrance, spilling dirt everywhere. Poor, innocent flowers. 😑

It's interesting that even though I've upgraded to a **much** nicer hotel, I'm still dealing with shocked, angry guests who deny smoking in their rooms.

It's so fucking **obvious** when someone has smoked in a non-smoking space. Even to me and I'm a smoker. I never smoke indoors because I don't want all my shit to smell.

I think a **lazy dumbass fee** should be applied in addition to the cleaning fee.

"Okay so this just happened a few seconds ago. I had this dude call the property and ask if he could use his $89.00 hotel coupon to get a room at the Hotel brand I work at. Now I've been here 2 fucking years now and I've NEVER heard of using coupons for a room? Not any message from corporate or anything from my managers about how to put a rate like that in so I asked if maybe he was looking at an online price and he said no that he was looking in a coupon book he got for travel. I told him that he could bring it in so I could look at it (because we were currently on the phone mind you) and that I could see what that was because I've never heard of a coupon being used to anything close to our properties brand. 

&amp;#x200B;

After hanging up the phone I immediately call my GM and ask her ""so um...Do we have coupons for rooms to be 89 dollars anywhere?"" and she was like ""uhhhh....no? Why?"" and I explain to her what this dude just said and she was confused as well. She said to let him show it to me and see what the hell it was because she had no idea what on earth it could be from. I could offer him one of the 3 main 10% at most discount rates but that was it.  

&amp;#x200B;

So he comes in around 15 minutes later with a coupon book that offers an 89 dollar rate for our property but doesn't have our number listed but some other phone number you are supposed to call. It said just to show it at check in and that we would give them the rate...Um???? I can't be crazy right like this isn't real??? I tell him the number isn't ours, and that while I see that it says this I'm not applying it because after I hung up with him I called my manager and she didn't know what it was either. There wasn't anything in our system to let me change the price to that rate? 

&amp;#x200B;

He said that he was aware that the number wasn't ours and had to google our number but still wanted the rate. I told him that I couldn't give it to him because no offence to him but the coupon didn't look legit and since my manager didn't know what it was the lowest I could give them was a one of our 3 10% discount rates. Him and his wife I'm assuming didn't like that and said that why can't they just get the employee rate since he works with our brand doing stuff. I said is he has a way to book it online and get his employee rate then that was fine but I can't just give out the employee rate to people who say they are employees. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said he didn't want to do that and honestly this encounter was getting sketchier as it went on. He then asked for another hotel of our brand in the area and I told him one about 20-30 minutes away and he went on his way. Do hotels use coupons????

"I just started working in hotel and hospitality, and I have to say, I love this job. You meet such strange people. Anyway, during my first day of training, I was shadowing the lobby attendant that I would be working with. A short elderly black man. My specific title is runner, and my duties entail running requests like towels, pillows, and blankets to rooms during peak hours, and tending the lobby during downtime. I work night shift. Anywho, we get called to make remake a bed in a room on the fourth floor because the sheets were stained with pee and red liquid (obviously not by them, right). We get there, and there’s about 14 people in this room. Equally spread between morbidly obese adults and morbidly obese kids. Most of the adults were drunk. They were celebrating a kids 10th birthday, lol. The matriarch of this family took my poor trainer around the room rubbing her fingers on all sorts of edges, like curtain rails, top of the mirror, etc. telling him how poorly of a job our housekeepers do, and that she’s the housekeeping supervisor for a rival hotel.

"This was a few years ago, but a non related post here jogged my memory. 

So I was doing the usual, working the morning shift, greeting guests, answering phones, and letting people check out late. 

This one guest in 384 (random room) wanted to check out late. No worries. I offered him 12, he wanted 1. We met half way at 12:30p because I was in a good mood and we had a ton of check outs, so HK wouldn’t be staying late anyway. 

Around 11:45a I think, he comes to the lobby and wants to stay until 2-3p. I tell him that’s not possible and I’m already giving him more time than what our policy states.  

He begins to do the whole complaint spheel where he listed everything wrong with the hotel. I listened patiently. He threatened to post his complaint to you-know-where and so on so forth. I continued to listen patiently. 

When he was done, I stare at him for a good 10 seconds ... 

“Okay, you have to leave now.”

He does an instant 180 and gets all wide eyed and shocked. I explained that he’s already bent on giving us a bad review despite the kindness I’ve shown him, so he might as well pack his stuff now and leave. One more bad complaint isn’t going to faze me. 

He began apologizing like crazy, and I relented and allowed him to stay until the previously agreed late checkout time. He came back to the lobby when he was done moving out, and apologized again. 

He didn’t end up posting a bad review IIRC, though I’m not sure if he posted a good review either.Sit yo ass down son! This is my kingdom.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey again. Doing my once a month sharing on Reddit today. 😏

As I've mentioned, I work at a full service resort. I'm still kinda new. Not new to hotels but definitely new to a special level of entitlement I've never witnessed.

Last night, a **top shiny** tier guest approaches my FOM with an interesting complaint. I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

""Yeah, so I'm a **DEMON** member and I shouldn't have to wait in line for the free drinks.""

""Ohh, sorry about that. I can contact the bar manager if you like.""

""No. I just wanted you to know it's ridiculous. You should have a special line for **DEMON** members.""

We serve FREE alcohol to **all** guests for 2 hours every night. Extremely generous, in my opinion. Perhaps too generous since the bartenders usually end up working their asses off for shitty tips.

The **DEMON** member confronted the bar manager about the line he felt entitled to bypass. The bar manager explained that it's actually illegal to have more than one line serving free alcohol.

My question to this **shiny** asshole (if only I could ask): Why not just bypass the whole (welfare) booze line by PAYING for your drinks at the regular bar? It's wide open and literally right fucking next to the FREE line. If you perceive yourself as ""better"", prove it. Shouldn't you be able to afford your own damn drinks?

Despite your **DEMON** status, you're nothing but a cheap, entitled fuck with a grandiose sense of self, given to you by a fucking hotel chain. Pathetic. Sad, really.

"I saw some similar posts to this regarding smoking fees... I have a story from my first hotel property, about 10 years ago. TLDR at bottom.
Apologies for mobile formatting, English is my first language, and I am still a sleepy front desk agent. Long time lurker! First time posting.

It’s the dead of winter and I’m blending in as a vampire. No one has noticed yet.

Me: me (17yo college student)

Guests: 1 and 2, early 20s girls. 

FDM: front desk manager (mid-20s guy, very respectful, never ever swears).


Any who, it’s 3am and my guests want to checkout. 

1/2: We shouldn’t be charged the full night because it’s only 3am

Me: (yeah, no, that’s not how this works). Unfortunately, the room rate is set and checkout time is by 11am, you are still being charged for the full stay. [Besides, they were on the first floor just a quick walk to our smoking area, shouldn’t be an issue IMO]

1: (as they are signing the receipt) Will we incur a smoking fee even though they didn’t smoke in the room? (GIANT RED FLAG HAS DRAPED OVER THE BUILDING).

Me: The fees at our non-smoking property only go onto receipts if the guests have smoked/damaged the room.

2: (They start YELLING at little ol’ sleepy me, at 3am) BUT WE NEVER SMOKED IN THE ROOM! You need to release their incidentals now!

Me: It is not up to me to determine what fees they incurred outside the nightly rate with tax, but here is my managers card and they can call and leave a voicemail.


Guest leaves, and I proceed to hear my managers phone go off every 15 minutes for about 2 hours.
Luckily me, being that the hotel is sold out and per our superextrashinymemeberperks, every member (no matter the status) gets a hand delivered newspaper. At our sold out property, where all of them are members. (Yay).
Cue ~200 squats in front of rooms to deliver the newspapers/receipts. I start from the top floor and work my way down like Mario, My buns of steel are glorious.

I get to the room they just checked out of and it reeks. Absolutely REEKS of some really cheap tobacco and possibly weed? Industrial room spray? I can’t tell because I’m gagging and need to keep going. I bring an Out of Order sign and place it in front of that room so other guests just think it’s a room being remodeled. I don’t have time for this, I need to make pots of coffee for our lobby.

Cue the FDM coming in at 6:30am, he wants to know what happened to cause his VM box to be full. We start to listen to the Voicemails and it’s just these girls going off job-stop about how we are racist for refusing their refund immediately, how could we do this to them, they need this money to get home, etc etc.
They were pulling everything from their book of Karen to be mad about, and to apparently yell about, regarding not receiving a full refund of incidentals immediately.
I tell my manager that their room reeks when I passed it, and we need to inspect it. Oh, and boy was this a fun inspection. You’d think we were renovating!

Per our security policies, we have an electronic box that will read the door lock to determine who has opened the specific door. Our windows in these guests rooms do not open for safety reasons. [just to clarify, they can be SHOVED open for fire emergencies and set off alarms, but not for just opening them].
We determine that besides housekeeping cleaning the room yesterday, the guests are the only ones who have accessed this room.
We go inside and my FDM immediately starts recording on his phone.

FDM: (speaking for the video) the day and time is current x and x, we just entered room 103 that checked out at 3am. Noting damages for the room..... (he starts listing off damages).
Me and FDM just look at each other and mouth whattheflyingshit.

They burned cigarette marks into the duvets of the bedroom, it reeks of smoke, and they left their bong in the garbage can. We look around confused because of the hole in the wall.... they took the flat screen tv. Now mind you, you can get a nicer tv from Walmart this size for about $400, it is not super nice and is not a large tv at all. The damages are well over $2000 from what my manager was stating (they broke almost everything expect the light fixtures, which were the cheapest things to replace in this room).
When getting back to the front desk, my FDM contacted them and more yelling continues..
I am standing next to him for this excitement.

FDM: good morning! This is FDM from pretty hotel, I am trying to reach out to a ms. 1?

1: IT IS ABOUT TIME, I have been waiting all morning for my refund. You take forever to respond, you know that?

FDM: my apologies ms. 1, I cannot respond to phone calls until I am actually at my desk. I wanted to ask if you had any guests in your rooms, or issues to report?

1: it was only me and 2 Last Name, the only issue I’ve had is your obvious lack of consideration for my time.

FDM: I am sorry Ms. 1, I will work on being better. Anywho, we have noticed damages to your room and need to make you aware of the charges to the room and we will not be issuing you a refund.

1: LISTEN HERE YOU FCKING PRICK, I said it was only me and 2 in that room and I will NOT be charged for damages.

FDM: ma’m, you will be charged for any damages you have caused to our rooms, it is not up for debate.

1: YOU FVKING -

My FDM hung up on her, and just forwarded her to VM.
He had to call the cops that morning for the extent of the damages caused, and we got to place a warrant for their arrest because the card only charged for the room and then they tried to cancel the card.

I’m working here in the lovely state of Connecticut, where this is a a crime to not pay your hotel room, subject to a warrant being placed for your arrest. From what I was told, they were able to pay after that was mentioned to them. (It is all heresy from my manager, please don’t quote me on it).

Ok. So what's the deal with showing an ID at check in for some of these **top shiny tier** members? Is this a common issue? 

This past week, 2 (very memorable) **DEMON** (highest tier) guests were super defensive about presenting their ID's to the front desk.

""Since always.""

""Oh no. I've never had to show my ID. Never. This is new.""

""It's normal procedure.""

Unfortunately, I wasn't there to witness all the details of this exchange but the guest became increasingly difficult during the remainder of his stay. 

Checking ID's is so important, especially on those **top shiny** reservations, since we can charge the CC on file without the card being physically presented. 

I've decided that if anyone else wants to give me shit about it, I won't ask them for it again. I'll just cancel their reservation and send them on their way. 😎Verify Or Bye",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

This guest decided the best place to put a use full nappy was outside of his bedroom door, why he thought this was an exceptable place I have no idea, we have a bin in the bathroom and a bin in the bedroom also his room was maybe 15ft from reception where I could have dispose of them in the bins out back, but not the corridor is the best place, out of site out of mind so they say.

Now where the fun part for me begins, at my site Im known for not giving a shit about confronting people, where some of my colleagues are a bit more hesitant unless its 100% warranted. I had the pleasure of chewing this guest out about the best pratice of disposing of soiled nappies, mention all the young children that could have picked it up, the damage it could have caused to the carpet in the corridor if it would have leak and how they would be liable etc.

Fingers crossed they got the point because no one wants to to clean up dirty nappies but part of of me want to charge them for a replacement carpet at extortionate markup.

-TLDR- Guest puts dirty nappy in the corridor instead of bin in room 15ft away from reception.Dirty nappy in the corridor.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Long time lurker, first time poster. I’ll try to keep this short. 

Two guys pull up in a (now very obviously rented) 2019 Corvette and they refuse to go park it in the lot. They have to have it front and center and don’t move it for any other guests to get around. They have chains on, iced out watches, the whole 9. They’ve got a code and a form to use our f&amp;f rate too which is maybe $70? plus INC. so the total for one night was barely $200. they also wanted an upgrade to a suite but we didn’t have any available. 

the card declined. 

they both stand in the lobby talking about how they tour with so many big names and big rappers, how they’re flying in and out of NY and LA. i try to make conversation while they get funds transferred, but really can’t do much else. especially because the big boss was trying to check them in. i’m still in training, so i had to just watch and take everything in and small talk them. they were friendly enough, but after a while they specifically wanted me to go show them their room. they refused to go with anyone else but me until finally our security took them up. 

they started talking bad about me to security, apparently very vulgar stuff, who eventually tells them to quit, shows them the room, then brings them back down. 

basically after two hours of us not budging on letting them in, and their card declining, they left to try another property. 

oh, and they also pulled out a wad of cash from their pocket (at least $300) and had $100s laying all over the backseat of their rented car.two “rappers” flaunting money but their card declined for $170",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It's a long one.  TLDR at the end.

About 8 years ago I worked the front desk of a rather nice hotel off a Highway in Kansas.  This particular part of the State was pretty empty but was on the route to several important places.  Most of the guests were nice.  A few hard to please people here and there.  Luckily I worked nights so usually by the time I started most of the guests had already checked in.  Those who came later at night were usually tired from traveling long distances.  They just wanted to check in and go to sleep.  Some people were night owls and would hang around to talk.  Usually that wasn't a problem.  But sometimes....

On the night of this story it was 1:30AM.  The time I cancel any unclaimed reservations is 2AM.  I have one paper notice still sitting in the reservation box.  I'm about to start the final audit for the night when the automatic doors slide open. I smelled him before I saw him stumble in.  Looked like late forties, early fifties.  Obviously drunk and carrying no suitcase.  I straighten up and brace for the unexpected.  Instead of yelling or making demands the guy asks how my night is and if he's still in time to claim his room.

I laughed and said, ""You just made it.  Are you soandso?""

""That's me."" His speech is slurred.  He reached forward and put a supporting hand on the counter, ""Do I need to do anything?""

""Just show me an ID and let me scan a credit card."" I reply with a smile.  He says nothing, just fumbles for his wallet.  He hands over the things I asked for.  I start entering the information.  Out of the corner of my eye I see the guy eyeing me up.  It's horribly obvious, probably because of how drunk he was.  

It's not a new thing.  You get all kinds after all.  Three weeks into the job I had started wearing a ring so I could tell customers that hit on me that I was taken.  Though truthfully I was single at the time.  As I hand the guy his key and an envelope with breakfast tickets he grabbed my hand softly, ""You're really beautiful."" he says in a sort of creepy way he probably thought was sexy

I somehow manage to keep my cool and smile as I take my hand back, ""Thanks.  It's just the standard uniform.  Will there be anything else?""

""Are you single?"" He asks, clearly just going for it thanks to the liquid courage

""No, I'm married."" I say with a smile as I flash my fake ring.  The tension that had been building in me started to ease.  This is where all the people who hit on me normally backed off.

""I won't tell if you don't."" he says with a sloppy wink while flashing me a ring of his own

Now I just feel sick.  Not only is this guy drunk and creepy.  He's married too!!  I frown, ""I'm really not interested.  And I think it's time for you to go to your room."" I point to my left, ""The elevator is just over there.""

The guy's smile remains wide as he makes a show of trying to peek around the corner without actually moving, ""Where?"" he kind of sounds like he's trying not to laugh

I sigh, ""Just there."" I make an extra turning motion as I point again, ""Literally just around that corner.""

""I can't see it."" He says in that same tone, still not moving more than his head.  He shoots me a creepy look and wiggles his eyebrows while saying, ""Could you come out here and show me?""

The door that leads to the Front Desk area is 10 feet from the elevator doors.  It closes quickly and locks automatically.  So, I say, ""Sure, copy me."" I gesture in the direction he should go while walking over to the door, making a bit of show of turning the knob.  He beams wider and rushes around the corner.  I poke my top half out of the crack I've made in the doorway and point directly at the elevators, ""They are right there. Your room is on the third floor.  Have a good night."" I shut the door before he can reply and run into the laundry room.  The TV with the camera feed on it is in there because that is also where the manager's desk is.  I watch the man stand there for about a minute before getting in the elevator.  Only when I see him exit it on the Third Floor do I sigh in relief.  My eyes scan the other camera feeds, mostly out of habit, and I see it.  A big truck, still running, is parked right in front of the main doors.  There is no one inside.  

Curious, I investigate.  Sure enough the truck is still running.  It's  also taken up all the space where people usually unload their suitcases for family members or hotel staff to take inside.  The doors are unlocked so I peek inside.  The whole things reeks of booze.  Only then does it really click that super drunk creepy guy drove here himself.  Also, the truck is a Stick.  I can't drive stick.  Which means I can't move the truck even if I wanted to. So instead I just turn the car off and take the car keys inside.

The next thirty minutes go normally. I've calmed down and moved on with my night.  I almost shit myself when the phone starts to ring.  The guest phone hardly ever rings after 11PM unless something is very wrong.  I answer the phone quickly, ""Hello, this is Front Desk.  What can I help you with?""

The voice on the other end is instantly recognizable, ""My TV remote won't work.""

I look down at the display on the phone and confirm my fear.  It was the room belonging to Creepy Drunk.  I hold in a sigh and respond, ""Have you made sure it's set to AUX."" That tended to be a problem for some reason, ""Just press the button that says A-U-X.  The light should flash red.""

""Nothing happened."" Creepy Drunk says without pause, ""The light didn't come on."" a short pause, ""Can you come up here and fix it for me?"" the tone was like rotten honey

I shivered, ""No."" I said firmly, ""If you come down here with it I can give you a replacement."" we had a whole drawer of spares just in case, ""Will there be anything else?""

""Please, I really need you up here.  I just know something is wrong with the TV.""

""No.  You can either come get a new remote or wait for maintenance.  They get here at 9AM."" Then I hung up.  Normally I wouldn't do that.  It's super rude.  But he was drunk and freaking me out. I'm the only one working.  No one would notice if I vanished for a few hours.  And it was obvious this guy wanted to live out some sort of hotel fantasy.  It truly felt like he was trying to turn his night into an adult film.  For the next few hours I locked myself in the back room.  I did paperwork and watched the cameras.  All was quiet.

Eventually I felt safe enough to walk the halls in order to slip receipts under doors.  As I try to be silent I start to go over the Breakfast stuff I need to complete downstairs in my head.  I work mostly on autopilot until I get to the Third Floor.  Door after door I slip papers through cracks.  I had just finished slipping paper under another door when I hear the one behind me open.  I had slipped a receipt under that door just a few seconds ago.  Assuming I had maybe woken someone somehow I turned with an apology on my lips.  But nothing came out.  I couldn't breath.  The papers slipped from my hands.  Creepy Drunk was just standing there.  He was staring at my butt. AND HE WAS NAKED!!!!!  Fear filled my whole body and as he reached out a hand (like an invitation) I bolted.

I ran all the way down the stairs and locked myself in the back room.  With my eyes fixed on camera feed I called the Police.  It only took a few sentences to relate what was needed.  The woman on the phone talked to me for the next few minutes.  She kept asking if I was safe and I said it looked like Creepy Drunk was still in his room.  When the Police show up on the cameras I hang up and greet them.  

Already long story short I give the Officers a keycard and lock myself back in the back room.  I call my manager to let her know what is happening.  Luckily the guy doesn't put up much of a fight.  No yelling or denials.  Just a guy in sweatpants staring at the floor.  I quit that job not long after. I just never felt safe there again.

TLDR: Creepy Drunk tries to hit on me.  I say no so he ends up flashing me. I call the Police and soon quit my job.Make being Drunk and Horny my problem...meet the Police!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guest calls around 3:30 am complaining that she *cannot* sleep because she is the only guest in a certain part of our hotel. We are undergoing renovations and large swaths of rooms throughout the property are down including her part of the hotel. Her room is literally the only one on that wing that’s open. She is upset that no one is around her and that she cannot sleep because it’s “eerie”. That is literally the first time I’ve heard that complaint at a hotel ... you’d think that’d be a giant plus. No noisy guests around you, no vehicles driving by at night, no one above you stomping around. But apparently she’d rather have all that than have a whole wing to herself. She had me on the phone exasperated for 20 minutes demanding I explain to her why the previous clerk “that stupid lady” didn’t inform her she’d be the only person staying in that area, and why she’d think that was ok. I literally didn’t know what to say. She was checked in at 10:45 and I get there at 11pm and we were low on rooms and that room was the only bottom floor we had. I’m sure it had something to do with that. All the marathon complainers seem to demand a bottom floor room. I reasoned with her as best I could and she ended her call with several long sighs and uncomfortable silences before swearing then hanging up. I’ve already typed up a concise note for the next shift ... something tells me they’re going to need it.Guest thinks it’s my fault the previous clerk checked her into an “eerie” part of our hotel.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Slow night here, so I figured I would tell a short story of something that happened about 15 minutes ago.

A guy called the hotel stating that he had been here and checked out today, and forgot his wallet. Nothing out of the ordinary so far in this call, but then he drops this little line on me:

""Do you mind getting it and reading off the credit card that is in it? I need it for check-in tomorrow in a hotel here in Utah.""

*record scratch*

Did this guy seriously just ask me to give him a credit card over the phone just because he claims he stayed here? For the record, we did have his wallet, but it was already packaged up for shipping and locked tightly in the managers office, so even *IF* I wanted to give him this info, he was SoL.

He did not like this and told me he is of ""the highest tier"" here. 

I am Me and he is I (idiot)

I: ""So what you are saying is you will not give me my credit card information?""

Me: ""No, sir. I cannot give sensitive information like that over the phone. And before you ask, no, I will not snap a picture and email it to you.""

I: ""This is insane, I stay there all the time! You even checked me in!""

Me: ""Again, that is very sensitive information, and if you are not who you say you are, there would be a lot of problems associated with that. I am sorry that I cannot help you with that.""

I: ""So I guess you won't help me out? What about customer service?""

Me: ""Sir, the service I am providing right now is security of very sensitive information. I do not know if you are someone just trying to steal information or not."" (I knew it was not, but even then I'm still not fucking stupid enough to do that)

I: ""Man, you really are screwing me over here. Just give my my info. Legally you have to!""

Me: ""If you didn't forget your wallet, we would not have such an issue at hand. Again, I am sorry that this happened, but...""

I: ""No, *I'm* sorry that I thought you were going to help me!"" (Help you with what? Committing possible CC fraud? If it was anyone other than me, they would not even know who you are, dude!""

It took another 5 minutes of me telling him no in various ways for him to give up and call management tomorrow. Fucking asshole.Idiot thinks I am going to give a credit card number over the phone!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello everyone. Your two nights a week NA here. Tonight has been an absolute shit show. My hotel has taken on a lot more flight crews in recent weeks, frankly more than the current staff can handle. The contracts the flight crews have with our hotel state that we have to provide them with shuttle service to and from the airport. Unlike a lot of other hotels, however we do not have dedicated shuttle drivers. When a shuttle has to go out to airport, we lose someone behind the desk.

Frequently this has meant second shift has only 1 person behind the desk, while the other person is constantly driving back and forth between the hotel and the airport picking up countless air crews. Tonight one of the air crews arrived early as our driver was coming to our hotel with another crew he had just picked up.

One of the FAs called us and I told him it would about 15 minutes (the allowed time per our contract) for our driver to arrive. The flight attendant threw a tantrum fit for a real queen cursing and screaming at me. I handed the phone off to my front desk manager as he requested and he cursed and screamed at her too.

When he and his crew finally arrived our driver told us he had thrown a penny at him and yelled “here’s your tip!” Our driver was almost tears. In addition, the FA kept bitching and moaning about everything and making quite a scene to the embarrassment of his coworkers (to their credit quite a few called down to apologize for his behavior)

Apparently the head of the flight crew union was within his crew and the asshole FA got told off. The asshole FA the had the gall to chase around my front desk manager and berate and accuse her of ratting him out.

Then there was the drunk guy. He was just wobbling around the lobby being cringey. At one point he lit up a cigarette in the lobby and had to be shooed outside. Anyway, he was staying with his girlfriend and when she wouldn’t open the door to his room he started banging on the door so loudly I could hear down at the lobby. Then (according to guests that called to complain) he threatened to kill her.

I called the police, but by the time he arrived it appeared he had finally made it into his room. I wanted him removed but the first set of officers stated I would need to provide him with a refund for them to remove him. I called my AGM and got her approval to provide the refund.

Another set of officers came down later though and stated that

1. They couldn’t do anything because he refused to open the door
2. That the first officer had told me wrong and that they couldn’t remove him. That they couldn’t even go into his room even if I opened the door for them because it was “like his house” that it was really a “civil matter” and that they could only stand outside in the hallway while I went in and asked him to leave.

Not sure if all that is true but I really don’t see the point of police officers if they can’t remove someone from private property. About to start the audit. Wish me luck guys. Hope the rest of tonight goes better. One bright note: my front desk manager got a $100 tip by a guy that saw her being hassled by the FA. She almost broke down in tears

**UPDATE: I made a second post to relay further drama with the drunk guy mentioned above, but it looks like it got stuck in the spam filter. Following is the events that occurred about two hours after the police left the first time**

Fast forward about 2 hours later and the phone rings as I’m at one of the tables doing the audit.

ME: Front desk, how can I help you

GUEST: Get security to the 3rd floor NOW!

Just as the guest on the phone said that a panicked young woman ran up to the desk sobbing and asking for help.

Lady: Please help me. My boyfriend is beating me up and he’s currently up there with my newborn baby. I couldn’t get him to give him to me!

ME: I’m calling the police now.

The young lady starts heading towards the door.

Lady: I have to go outside.

Judging by my previous experience with the police I figured if she left there would be no victim and they would again do fuck all.

ME: No! You have to stay in here! I say as forcefully as I can.

She was absolutely terrified, but I knew she had to stay to talk to the police. I motioned for her sit down in the lobby as I talk to dispatch. Eventually dispatch starts asking questions about what occurred in the room so I hand the phone to her. As she starts talking to dispatch the drunk dumbass from earlier comes into the lobby holding a tiny baby up against his shoulder.

He starts to berate the young lady calling her methhead. He then turns to me and says “Can you believe this.” She begs him to give her the baby. And he says “he’s my son.” He gets closer to her and she starts sobbing and screaming at him to get away from her and agains begs him to give the baby to her.

He again turns around to me and says “Can you believe this?”

Then she says the words that are still haunting me. “Or please give the baby to him! Please just don’t hurt my baby!” All I could do was stare like a deer in headlights staring at this 6’3 man holding a baby against his shoulder. Part of me wanted to reach out to get the baby and ask for him to give him to me. But I was afraid that might set him off. I was just frozen, deathly afraid that this guy might end up throwing this tiny baby against the wall or something.

Finally after what seemed like forever, he lays the baby down on one of our couches and walks out of the hotel. The cops arrive finally after about 15 minutes after I started the call. Some paramedics come in and check both baby and mom out. They leave are confirming they weren’t seriously hurt.

The cops talk to the young lady for about 40 minutes. They ask for a new key to her room since the drunk guy took off with the old one. I make a new key and ensure that any old keys the drunk guy may have will no longer work. The cops go up with the young lady and baby to the room to make sure the drunk guy hasn’t sneaked back into the room. After confirming the room is empty the cops leave.

Most terrifying and horrifying experience I have had at this hotel since starting a year ago. I hope I never have to go through something like this againThe Asshole Flight Attendant and the Drunk Guy: Recipe for a Bad Night",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"The recent loud kids story reminded me of the wildest kids story I have. 

So it's a normal day just like any other. I was sitting at the desk doing nothing in particular when the phone rings. 

Me: Front desk, how can I help you?

Embarrassed Father: Yeah ... uh ... do you have like ... spare towels and washcloths?

Me: Yes of course. Would you like to come pick some up?

EF: Yeah, sure ... I uh ... I left to the store for a minute and I left my boys in the room ... well they were ... they were trying to record the sound of themselves ... uh ... passing gas and ... well they made a mess.

EF: Yeah listen ... I don't want anybody to have to clean this so ... I'll just go get the towels and I'll make sure they clean it all up.

Me: Uh, yeah of course.

A few minutes later he walks in and just says ""uh ... towels?""

I got him like four bath towels, six hand towels, and at least a dozen washcloths. While handing him the towels I just kind of looked at him with my best ""I'm sorry"" face.

"So... my hotel just got bought out by another company. They are keeping most of the staff, including me, and have been pretty cool about it so far. The thing is: the transition has been a little rough and handled poorly by the current management. 

We found out in December but we were told by the current management not to tell anyone, including regulars, long-term stays, etc. Surprisingly, we all managed to keep our mouths shut and 2 weeks ago we got the go-ahead to start explaining the situation to guests. The only problem with this is that management decided to have us continue making reservations even for dates we know that we will be closed on for renovations. They also left our inventory open on our website and on all the 3rd party sites until 2 days ago. For whatever reason, we not only have to cancel all reservations for the dates we will be closed, but also all future dates up until Jan 2021.

The regulars have been mostly disappointed, but understanding. The long term stays were all pretty pissed, but they are here on their companies dime so whatever. Management has been able to contact most people who made reservations with us directly and explain the situation. The real issue, as always, has been with the 3rd party sites. One in particular cancelled all reservations made through them and sent the following email:

""We are sorry to inform you that you are no longer welcome at &lt;insert hotel name&gt;. Your reservation has been cancelled and you have been issued a full refund.""

The past few days, even working overnights, the phone has been ringing off the hook; with 90% of calls being pissed off guests that booked through this 3rd party.

Queue the following conversation: Me - Me DB - douchebag guest

Me: ""Thank you for calling &lt;insert hotel name&gt;, this is sternlip, how can I help you?""

DB: ""Yeah, I wanna know why my reservation was cancelled.""

Me: ""OK sir, what was your arrival date?""

DB: ""The 15th. It's my wife's birthday and Valentine's weekend. I want to know why you cancelled my reservation.""

I explain to him that we got bought out and that we will be closing down for a few weeks to renovate. I look up his reservation and see it is a prepaid through a 3rd party. We go through the ""but I already paid"" conversation and I explain to him that due to the transition the 3rd party cancelled the reservation and I am currently unable to make him a new one.

DB: ""Well that is shitty, so you got bought out by &lt;insert company name&gt;? Well they're not gonna give a shit. What am I suppossed to do? It's my wife's birthday and Valentine's day weekend.""

Me: ""Well like I said, you should check with &lt;insert 3rd party name&gt; and make sure that the refund has gone through. You're welcome to rebook after we reopen on the &lt;insert date&gt;.""

DB: ""Well are they gonna give me the same rate?""

Me: ""I can't speak for the 3rd party and I'm not sure if our rates will change after we reopen. We will know more about that once the transition has gone through.""

BD: "" This is really shitty you know. This is no way to run a business. Is this something you do often? It's my wife's birthday and now our plans are ruined.""

\*stunned silence\*

DB: ""Well!?""

Me: ""No sir, we are not very often bought out by a different company. In fact, this is the only time it has happened in the five years I have worked here. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""""Is this something you do often?""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I don’t know why, but it seems like the craziest things tend to happen on Thursday nights. To make matters worse, my security guy doesn’t work most Thursdays for some reason. Thankfully, I can generally handle crazies by myself, but last night was something else.

Early on in the evening, a new reservation showed up in my arrivals. A little while later, a girl walked in to check in along with whom I would assume was her boyfriend. I get her credit card information, check her in and it seemed to be going how it should until after I hand her her keycards.

Guest: Can you escort me to my room?

I was a little bit flustered by the request, but I still kept my customer service smile.

Me: Unfortunately, I’m not allowed to leave the front desk. Sorry about that.

It was an odd request. Nobody has asked me that before. Heck, our rooms are ridiculously easy to find, too. Just keep on walking down the hall until you find it. No turns with room 300-325 one way and 326-350 the other way.

Still, I thought nothing of it and just continued on with my night. The girl and her boyfriend left for a little bit and then came back. I just did what I usually did: watched YouTube, looked at stuff on reddit and occasionally patrolled the first floor of the hotel since my security guy wasn’t there.

Then the lady and her boyfriend showed up again. She walked up to the front desk and asked for another keycard since she accidentally left hers back in her room. I thought, *no biggie,* and assured her that it happened all the time. Then I gave her the card, expecting her and her boytoy to leave.

But she didn’t. She argued with her boyfriend a bit, telling him to just go get his stuff out of the car, saying it was unlocked. This happened several times. She then started talking to somebody on the phone until she started arguing with them while wandering the lobby, slowly getting louder to the point where I was tempted to tell her to quiet down. I was actually getting pretty annoyed at that point. Boyfriend was just kind of following her around while she argued with whoever it was on the phone.

Then she did something so unexpected, so stupid and so aggravating I was just gobsmacked that anybody would even consider such a thing. While by the sundry shop, she, out of nowhere, just knocked off the metal lid for the trash can over there, sending it flying across the floor toward the front desk. I was in shock, but I was also angry. So I picked up the lid, cutting my thumb in the process, and try to put it back together and put it back on the trash can. While I did so, I told the girl off. I was absolutely ticked.

Me: You need to leave, right now.

Guest: But I have a room here!

Me: I know, but you need to at least leave the lobby. You can’t just throw stuff around.

Finally, the girl and her quiet boyfriend walked down the hall. I glanced over there after washing the blood off my thumb and saw what was going on. The girl and her boyfriend were by the vending machine and the lady had the gall to have knocked down a couple of plants that were low to the ground across from it. At that, I started walking toward them and, as soon as they saw me coming, they scurried out the side door.

Thankfully, nothing was broken, so I just put the two small plants back in their holder back, careful to wipe off any blood. I also went over and finally found a band-aid to cover up my bleeding thumb. I would have done so earlier but I was so angry and trying to keep an eye on those annoying guests. Well, the girl was annoying, at least.

I checked outside and they were arguing with another guest from their car. I don’t know how somebody could be so belligerent. The other guest came in and the car drove off. He assured me that they were gone, thankfully. Just to make sure, I performed the petty task of deactivating the girl’s keycard. I was also prepared to tell the girl that they were not allowed back into the hotel after her little stunts.

After that, I am happy to say, I never heard anything from them. I didn’t check them out or anything, and judging from the log, apparently, they were checked out shortly after I clocked out, which makes me wonder if the girl who came in after me just went ahead and checked them out. The only other thing I heard about them, though was from a long-term stay who remarked that he heard her arguing on the phone outside and that apparently, she was hitting herself? It didn’t make much sense, but not much about my interactions with her did.

For instance, back at the beginning, she asked me to escort her to her room. Why? Did she plan on somebody sneaking behind my desk and robbing it or something? Not to mention, the random acts of violence against inanimate objects while arguing on the phone was something that made absolutely no sense.

Hopefully I never see that girl again. According to her reservation, she lived on the other side of the country. I hope she went back there and stayed there.

"This just happened a little while ago:

I work at a historic hotel and we are by far the nicest hotel in the area, but there are far cheaper (read: dirtier) hotels within pretty close proximity. A woman came in asking if we were busy a a few select dates in the upcoming months. I informed her that we had openings for those days and were almost completely empty. She is in a band and the band has a lot of members. The band will be playing in the bar that is directly next door to us (physically attached but a separate entity than our company). She heard that we often offer discounts to the band if we have openings, and we do in the winter because we can. In the summer we are too busy.

I offer her a deal of taking a few suites for $99 USD, which is about $50- $60 less than their normal price. She books three rooms each day but then says that she was hoping that I'd be generous and give her a couple free rooms. I said I couldn't really justify that. She said if the rooms were empty anyway it shouldn't be that big of a deal. I told her I have a staff to pay and utilities that need to be covered, and I already gave her a $150.00 deal when I didn't need to. She says that I could give her a better deal, I just didn't want to. I remind her that I could rescind the deal. ""Oh nononono, you don't have to do that, just thought I'd ask.""

After a volley of more questions, she says that the bar is only paying them so much so they could only afford so much. She asks once more for at least one free room a night. I tell her that I have no incentive to give her a free room. And again, I already gave you a heavy discount that I originally offered, without prompting! Also we are close to other hotels that average nightly rate runs $50-$60.

She settled for just adding a cot to some of the rooms to fulfill the beds she needed.

I put a note on her folio that she might try to weasel her way out of paying or getting free rooms.

"I've only been working at this hotel since June, but I've been working in hotels for the past 5 years so I picked up pretty quickly. I mainly do morning shifts with a man that's been there since the hotel opened-- so 12 years-- and he is the worst human being I've ever met in my life. 

He's rude to everyone-- including guests-- gossips about everyone in every department, and never has a nice thing to say about anyone. This man is 63 years old, and apparently working here is just his ""passtime"". He's said on multiple occasions ""I don't need this job, I'm only here because I was too bored when I retired for 3 months"". So he sticks around to make everyone miserable. 

He's also, racist, sexist, homophobic and probably anything else you could think of. And he voices his opinions about everything very loudly and doesn't care if anyone hears him. 

I've gone home crying a few times because of how he's treated me. My favorite is when he said ""you fucked everything up!"" over something very minor that wasn't even a mistake. 

I've gone to the FOM multiple times about his behavior, and most recently because he shoved me pretty violently, and all she ever says is ""we'll talk to him"". I know it's not her fault, she's an amazing Manager and one of the only reasons why I haven't quit yet, but it's the GM that's scared of him. I don't know if he has something on her, but his actions never seem to have any consequences and I'm sick of it. I love my job but I'm under so much stress working with him everyday and I don't know what to do anymore. 

Sorry for the rant, but I just needed to share this.The worst co-worker I've ever had",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So it's after 3am and I get a call about a couple fighting in a room. I'm about to head up and check it out when I get a call from said room.

Him: Call the cops.

Me: Okay, what's going on?

Him: Just call 'em. Room 108. (click)

I call, but literally can't give them any info other than someone called reporting fighting from their room.

As soon as I get off the phone with them, the guy comes down and tells me his girlfriend was hitting him and that he wanted her arrested. I told him the police were on the way.

Him: But she's leaving right now. She's gonna get away. You need to do something.

Me: I'm sorry. I'm not a cop and I can't do anything about it.

He gives me a dirty look and goes back toward the room (I assume to try to stop her himself). I start hearing yelling and brace for the complaint calls. (Luckily there were none.)

He comes back a moment later and tells me she just kicked the s\*\*t out of him and he wants her arrested. I tell him again that police are on the way. At that moment, I look at the camera and see a unit pulling into the lot and I tell him so.

At that moment, she walks out the door and he chases after her. The officers don't even bother to come in.

A little while later, one of the officers brings him to the desk to talk to him while the other questions his girlfriend in the room. I couldn't believe the story that came out of his mouth.

Him: I was just mad because there's this dog in the room across the hall that's been barking all night. I'm so tired because every time I try to go to sleep, the dog barks and wakes the baby up.

I can't believe what I'm hearing. I try to tell the cop the story he'd told me, but he just goes on with his lie. Then I look up the room across the hall. Guess what. Empty. So I'm pretty sure there's no dog in there. I offer to let the officer check the room but he declines.

Finally he takes the guy back up to his room. After a while, the officer comes back down and asks where the ice machine is. I tell him and he asks if that's the only one. I say yes. Then he tells me the guy had said he was going to get ice and they let him. Apparently they found out he had a warrant while he was gone and now he was nowhere to be found.

They looked for him but finally gave up and left.

The kicker is, this asshole actually had the nerve to come down the next morning and demand a refund because of the dog. He hadn't even paid for his own room. A local church had. I really wish they would stop doing that.

Of course I had told my relief the whole story when she came in and she told him that she knew the truth and he was no longer welcome at our location.

It's amazing how many people think we don't talk to each other.No officer. We weren't fighting. I was mad about a barking dog.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So as I've stated before, my hotel provides parking onsite or across the street at a parking garage. For the most part, people are chill about having to move thier car to the parking garage after settling in because we have already assigned onsite parking. But my absolute *favorite* response during my shift to telling someone that they will need to park across the street is the very matter of fact: ""actually I've already parked"". 

Obviously sir. I don't expect every single guest to jump out of a moving car and have someone on standby until they know where to park. 

We have clear signs about parking. I would probably get reprimanded for being rude if I pointed them out to someone every single time someone tried that response. It's like all these grown ass people somehow made it to adulthood without forming the concept of object permanence. They can't understand that people *leave* sometimes.

"TL;DR my first hotel stay, girl gets embarrassed, I get embarrassed.

Thought a funny story might be good tonight!

When I was about 13, my parents took us all to a beach/resort town for a week.  We were staying in a smaller boutique hotel.  The lobby and front desk were decorated in deep stained woods with brass and stained glass all around.  The lobby had leather chairs and card tables and a couple sofas to watch the TV.  Back then, there were 3 regular channels and 2 VHF.   There were no TV's in the rooms.   The staff was pretty proper, yes sir, no sir etc... but they were very nice.

My dad and I had left the room so mom and my sisters could get ready, and we were sitting in the lobby playing Cribbage.  A teenage girl came in from the boardwalk and walked passed us and up to the desk.   I noticed because the girl looked close to my age and she was wearing a yellow bikini.  Dad stopped to watch me watch her as she stopped at the front desk.

The clerk asked if she could help her and she whispered an answer.   The clerk asked again and she leaned in and whispered again.   The clerkled asked a 3rd time and she whispered again.

The clerk was an ancient, gray haired old lady that looked like everyone's grandmother.  I think she either owned the hotel, or someone in her family did.   

The clerk apologized to the girl and she got ready to ask again.  The clerk leaned forward to hear her better.   The girl leaned in and just as the she went to answer, the world got quiet.  You know those times where for a couple seconds, it seems all sound and conversation stops?

At just that same time, the girl got a little louder than she wanted and we ALL heard, ""toilet paper please!""    She knew as soon as it left her mouth that the whole lobby heard her.   Her bright red skin was a great contrast to her yellow bathing suit, and she was not sunburned!  She put her hand over her mouth, gasped, and took the 2 rolls of paper the clerk was holding out for her.   She then ran up the steps, forgoing the elevator.

The clerk looked at us and said, poor girl, she's so embarrassed!   

Dad and I said, ""why?   Everyone's gotta go sometime.""

We were still in the lobby when she came down, probably about a half hour (or more later).  Mom was slow!  She saw us and gasped when the elevator door opened.   We saw her and gave her a thumbs up and said, ""don't worry about it.  Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?""

She said ""right"" and thanked us and RAN out the door to the beach.

But it didn't end there.   We kept running into her and her friends the whole week we were there.  ""Toilet paper"" became the joke and everyone joined in.   Even the girl and her friends, in fact, they started it.    They'd catch my dad and I in the lobby watching TV or playing cards and she'd see us and loudly ask us for toilet paper.    Or we'd be at an arcade or pizza stand and hear ""hey, got any toilet paper"".   She seemed pretty good natured about it.

One night I told her I was never going to ""go"" again, I was going to hold it in until I exploded (boy humor) and she thought that was the funniest thing she ever heard.   

One night, maybe half way through our stay, mom and dad wound up meeting her parents and they had a good chuckle over the story.   I remember when mom and dad came up the room, they said, ""we met your girlfriend's parents"".   It was MY turn to glow beet red!   I stuttered at mere mention of ""girlfriend!""   

It wasn't until the ride home that they explained to me that the girl thought I was a few years older than I was.  (I was a tall kid, well over 6 feet tall).    They told me that the girl had flirting with me, but I was clueless!   I just thought she was funny and liked to smile.My first memory of a hotel",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Just to recap, I spent 2012-2015 working for one of the largest hotel chains in the UK here in London. Warming up from Round 1:-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/eqljxy/fun\_times\_in\_the\_hotel\_suites\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/eqljxy/fun_times_in_the_hotel_suites_1/)

Today, I'm going to let those of you who don't work in the biz in on a little secret. Our hotel chain (and I was told the others all did the same thing) routinely sold more rooms than we actually have. It's called an overbooking policy, and it's responsible for more staff and customer misery than almost anything else.

The way it works is very simple. When checkin time on the day comes, first in is first served. If we've sold five more rooms than we have, and all the rooms are full up by 10:30 PM? Tough luck. Doesn't matter how far in advance you booked, or how much you paid, we'll have sold your room on to someone else.

Every hotel in our chain had their own individual overbooking level; which was set centrally by a computer algorithm crunching how many 'no shows' we'd previously had. If we had an average of say, three no shows a night? The online booking system would be willing to take bookings for three more rooms than the hotel actually had. Which means that if everyone who had paid for a room actually showed up? That's when the problems began.

Technically, the hotel was covered. Buried deep in the T &amp;C of the booking contract, the company reserved the right to transfer their booking in the event that we felt like it. But naturally, you can't say that to an angry customer at half twelve. So we'd lie. Always. 'Oh, a dog got in and shat all over the room'. 'Yeah, lighting hit the water tank on the roof, and so the room below is uninhabitable'. 'There was a murder there last night, so the room is cordoned off for evidence'. Whatever half plausible story we could concoct, we'd use. Because despite it being the T &amp; C, it was actually policy not to mention it to the customer unless you were actually forced to. On top of which, we sure as hell didn't want the abuse which would result from admitting we'd sold their bedroom on to someone else.

But we wouldn't just give them a refund. Nonono. We were supposed to call them a cab to the next nearest branch of the chain with spare rooms. But here's the nub. We weren't allowed to transfer the bookings until the customer had actually showed up (in case the rooms in the other branch were needed for a transfer from a third branch). Which meant that when they rolled in at whatever godforsaken early hour of the morning, they'd have to wait for us to call around other branches, find a room, call a cab, and then journey there.

And things never even ran that smoothly. The minute that you realised you only had one or two rooms left, you'd immediately lie to anyone calling to ask if you had any spare. The reason? Because whilst you could turn away walk-ins by saying you were full; you lived in terror of a new online booking dropping through and taking you over your room count because you'd given away your last surplus rooms to walkins or customers from another branch. So every evening was characterised with reception staff at different sites lying to each other about how many rooms they had left.

I remember one evening when I told some little chavvy shit we were fully booked (we actually were), and he just stood back andbooked a room on his phone (taking me over). And I had to honour the booking because even though I'd told him we were full, and that he'd be taking someone else's room, he just didn't give a damn.

The customers themselves were almost always guaranteed to be pissed, and fairly so. Driving all day and booked in as a stopover? Like hell do you want to drive elsewhere. Booked your room in anticipation of a business conference down the road? Of course you don't want to be sent to another site fifteen miles away. Got a bunch of tired kids exhausted from a day out? You can bet your stars they don't want to be pushed into a cab.

Staff would try every trick to try and squeeze people in. Running upstairs yourself to scrub and clean a room from an early departure to prep it for a new arrival; even though cleaning isn't your job? Check. Taking rooms offline in advance of big local events so you could bring them back online suddenly on the night? Check. Ringing regular customers in advance so you could try and get them to detour before you'd even filled up? Check.  You say it, someone tried it.

Why? All in a desperate effort to NOT have to deal with the sheer level of emotional stress and misery that this dumb fuck policy caused ***every*** staff member and late arriving customer.Fun Times in the Hotel Suites #2",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This one happened the night before last. 50% occupancy for 400 rooms. A lot of our guests are here for professional conferences and meetings right now. Not too many leisure travelers.

At 1:06 AM my alarm panel starts going off. The alarm panel is different from the ear shattering alarm that goes through the entire hotel. The panel is more of an annoying beep beep from the control cluster in the back office. It gives us time to investigate before emergency services are alerted and more importantly before the property wide alarm goes off. 

I knew that the alarm system had been acting funky, so I dispatched my security guard to the site where it said that a pull station had been activated. He came back on the radio saying false alarm, the pull station lever was still in position. I attempted to clear the notification on the panel, but the panel wasn't cooperating with me and I just knew that the alarm was going to sound. Sure enough it went off, but I was able to silence it within a half second. That one didn't raise any phone calls although I'm sure it woke up most of the guests.

Since the lights were all still flashing and making me very nervous, I called the alarm company and asked for a tech to walk me through the steps to make sure that the alarm did not sound again. He walked me through and seemed to be very knowledgeable of my exact panel configuration. He told me that he had been there just the day before. So as he was walking me through the steps, sure enough, one of the buttons actually set off the alarm and froze the panel for 5 SECONDS before I could silence it. I told the tech that's exactly what I was trying to avoid, and he apologized profusely and told me to call his personal number if anything else happened. 

At this point all of the panel lights are back to normal, but now the phone is ringing off the hook because at least 200 people are now wide awake in the middle of the night and probably thinking that there might actually be an emergency.

Out of all of the phone calls no one was throwing a tantrum. 99% of the calls and people that came to the lobby were satisfied to hear that it was a false alarm and then they went back to sleep. Only two guests actually had a gripe, and even they were not nasty towards me. They were understanding that it was a situation outside of my control. You better believe I took care of the night for them and more. 

TL;DR Alarm went off in the middle of the night because of a glitch. Alarm went off a second time because I was trying to fix the problem. Almost no complaints, and the ones that I did receive were very polite, they got everything they wanted.Fire alarms",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So disclaimer, I don't work in a hotel but I do work for in-house marketing and customer service for a Korean spa in my area that offers overnight stays. I used to work the floor so I'm pretty familiar with all sorts of customer service issues that come through our door, but this was a new one. 

For some background, Korean spas have admission fees that are essentially the guest's day pass to use all the saunas, lounge areas, different types of hot tubs, etc. and overall just relax with no time limit. Our spa sells individual passes, but we also sell them in a discounted multiple-entry bundle, and they're valid on any day up to their 2-year expiration date. On January 1st, we rolled out a new policy allowing us to still accept expired tickets, but we'd just have to upcharge guests for that day's admission cost (on weekdays the upcharge would be $6 and on weekends it would be $11). Previously we used to just not accept the tickets altogether and make guests pay full price, so this is honestly an improvement from a customer standpoint, and so far most of our guests have been more than happy to pay the fee since they can still use their expired tickets.

Cue this old lady who comes in a couple days ago (a weekday) with what looked to be her husband and a friend. Now, our office is situated right by the front door and lobby so managers can be on hand easily whenever the check-in/check-out lines get busy. The door to the office is ajar, but also says ""Employees Only"" in clear signage (this will be important later). A front desk attendant comes in and lets us know that a guest has 3 expired admission tickets, doesn't wanna pay the fee - which would only have been $18USD, and was ""told"" by a manager that goes to her church that her ticket would still be accepted. So the floor manager for the day goes out to the front desk to talk to her. Next thing you know, us in the office hear a whole lot of yelling and arguing going back and forth - we're nosy and look at the cameras, and we see this old lady waving her hands around and refusing to be let in for free while the manager just repeats that he cannot do that for her. At one point she even tried to throw the tickets over the desk at him. Finally, after about 20 minutes of this, she pays and then goes in with her guests. Manager comes back to the office, everything seems peachy. 

But about 30 minutes later, this old lady walks right tf through our office door (EMPLOYEES ONLY), holding her arm out and pointing daggers at the manager she spoke to. Meanwhile, me and my coworkers are just sitting at our laptops doing our work with this lady way too close to our table.

M = Manager; CL=Crazy Lady

CL: ARE YOU THE MANAGER HERE?????

M: (getting up from his seat) Uh, yes ma'am, I am one of the managers, what can I do for you?

CL: You charged me for the entry fee even though I had tickets!!!!

M: Well ma'am, your tickets were expired so we just needed to charge you for the difference in price. You were still able to use your tickets.

CL: Well that's ridiculous, what kind of policy is that? These tickets are supposed to be FREE.

M: I apologize, but they expire after 2 years. So instead of turning you away entirely, our policy is to have guests match the difference. We announced it on our website and our social media at the beginning of the month. I can show it to you on our website if you'd like.

CL: Well I didn't see that!

M: Well, just because you didn't see it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Again, I'm happy to show you where we have it in our policy list.

CL: This is absolutely ridiculous......45 years I've been in this country...45 YEARS!!! And I've never seen anything like this.

M: Ma'am I can assure you that many other businesses have expiration dates on their coupons.

CL: No they don't, I've never seen that!

M: They definitely do, and I am just following company policy.

CL: Company policy - that's ridiculous. YOU MADE THIS POLICY!!!

M: Ma'am I did not make this policy.

CL: YES YOU DID!!!

M: Again, I am *not* the policymaker, I am just the policy-upholder.

CL: You made this policy and it's a stupid policy!!!!

So they went back and forth like this for about 15 minutes. Clearly, my coworkers and I are immature bc we kind of wanted to laugh at how out of pocket the whole situation was and it got hard to keep a straight face the angrier we got lol. Finally, my manager was clearly getting fed up with this old ass lady.

M: Ma'am, you are causing a scene and distracting our employees as you've walked into an employees-only area. I'm happy to discuss this with you outside the office.

(They move right outside the doors, but we can still hear them arguing. Still in awe of how my manager stayed calm and kept his voice level, even as she screamed at him.)

CL: \*still going off about how the new policy sucks and is bad business, among all sorts of other things)

M: I'm sorry but if you continue disrupting our environment like this we will have to ask you to leave the premises.

CL: LEAVE THE PREMISES?? I WAS FORCED TO PAY!!

M: I can show you in the lobby where we have our facility rules stating we have the right to remove any customers who are deemed to be disruptive and abusive towards staff. 

CL: Well I won't be leaving, I want to know why I had to pay $18 extra.

M: Oh you're not leaving? I'll have to call the police then if you refuse to leave.

CL: Go ahead then, call the police if you want!! I'm the one who was scammed!!!

M: Alright, I will - so just to get your verbal acknowledgment of this, you're refusing to leave private property?

CL: Yes I am!!!

M: Okay, great, before I call can I just confirm again that you're refusing to leave and admit to trespassing into an employees-only area?

CL: Yes, because you made a bad policy!!

M: So I can call the police?

CL: GO AHEAD AND CALL THE POLICE I WON'T LEAVE!!

M: So *again,* just to confirm, *again,* you will not leave even after you've been asked and told that we have the right to remove disruptive people from the building?

CL, tired of these circles: YES!!!! DO IT, GO AHEAD AND CALL THEM!!!!

So my manager pulled out his phone and, from what it sounded like, started dialing. I think her other guests finally came and collected her before anything could actually happen, and they ended up leaving as she muttered to herself about the ""crazy, ridiculous policy"" lol. To top it all off, my manager walked back into the office like nothing even happened. No police were called after all, but we were all just shook at how that one event really took up a good chunk of our workday. And props to our manager for not bending over for entitled customers, not a single bit. I do wish I could've seen this little old lady try to explain this waste of time to the responding officers that would've showed up.

**TL;DR:** Old lady gets upset at a new expired admission policy at our spa. Trespasses into a restricted area to confront manager, manager does not bend, threatens to call the police to remove her for trespassing onto private property and disturbing staff, all while freely admitting her actions - all over $18.Old lady makes a scene and trespasses over $18...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I realized my first post wasn’t a tale, and got called out.  😂 but I will share a story that is one of my favorites.  I had just recently started at the hotel and I was working a morning shift.  At 9am, a lady and a man walked in.  The lady said, “we are here to check in.”  I looked at her because it was only 9am.  I told her that check in was 3 o’clock and we didn’t have anything ready.  She said, “but I’m VIP.”  I replied, “Ok, but the rooms still aren’t ready.”  She huffed and puffed, I asked for her name.  When I looked in our system, she wasn’t even scheduled for that day.  I was so excited to share this.  I simply said, “ma’am, you’re reservation isn’t even for today.” She didn’t say two words to me and walked out.  The gentleman followed without saying a word either.

So today (Friday) is the day we get paid and apparently something happened with the bank where we won’t get paid until Monday, obviously I along with anyone else who gets direct deposit are a bit frustrated but what can we do right? Everyone has bills to pay, including me, but the reality is that we have to wait

One of our employees I’ll call CE (I work in the main office) calls in and this is how the conversation goes:

Me: *company name* this is SunsetLink how can I help?

CE: hi this is CE I called yesterday to make sure I get direct deposit and I don’t see it deposited on my account

Me: oh right yeah I do apologize but there was an issue with the bank where we won’t be getting our paychecks deposited until Monday 

CE: are you serious? I have bills to pay, why couldn’t you guys just tell me yesterday that you were having issues I would have resolved something. Who’s in charge of payroll because this isn’t right and I can’t get late fees because I’m getting paid on Monday.

Me: I understand your frustration in all of this but you aren’t the only one affected, everyone who has direct deposit in the system did not get their paychecks so I’m in the same boat as you, unfortunately we didn’t find out about this until today.

CE: *thinking the world revolves around her and I’m lying* so you didn’t know that the bank was having an issue and that’s why you couldn’t tell me? Yeah ok I doubt that others are having the same issue

Me: *taking a moment to just gather the brain cells I lost over talking to this person* like I stated everyone who has direct deposit won’t be getting their paychecks until Monday and that includes me and unfortunately there’s nothing we can do on our end as it has to do with the bank.

CE: *scoffing* yeah ok I’m going to have to figure out how to pay my bills this weekend because of your mistake, bye. *ends call*

TL;DR employee thinks world revolves around her and a bank error is something we can foretell

"This was a few weeks ago, and I didn't work that particular night where all hell broke loose at our hotel, but I was going through our Dooking.com Sent messages folder and saw our GM's response to a guest that made me go daaaaamnmmnn.

At about 7PM on a busy Thursday night, our entire PMS went down for no reason and without any warning. Turned out the company had a server error meaning every single hotel that used the same software was fucked, and that they had no idea what caused it or how long it would take to get it back up.

But that wasn't all. There was a snowstorm that day, temperature was about -25C (-13F). At night, it dropped even lower. At around midnight, our hot water stopped working because it was so cold and some equipment exploded. Guests started blowing up the phone. The NA phoned our GM in a panic. The GM frantically called up every plumbing company but nobody answered her calls. She told the NA to try calling again at 6AM and keep trying until someone answered. In the mean time we tried to soothe the guests; some were grumpy, some understood, some screamed. The GM said to comp everybody's room once our PMS was back up. That seemed to calm most of them down.

Except one guy. His Dooking.com message reads as follows:

""No hot water to take a shower for entire stay no bathtub as advised in the advertisement??

I should get a free 2 night stay I had to go to another place to rent another hotel last minute to take a shower both 2 days that is horrible, both days stayed at your place had no hot water for a shower and no one came to clean the room at all I think a 2 night free stay for another time of my choosing is in order for not providing basic room requirements, also we had no bathtub as advised in the advertisement just a shower, which we couldn't use anyways, come on seriously, you should have a plumber available 24/7 to fix everything, its the cost of doing business man.""

Note: 

1. Our rooms either had a shower or a tub and it's clearly stated everywhere, and if this guy wanted a tub instead of the shower he could've let us know... but he didn't.

2. Without the PMS, our HK was fucked. Some HK didn't come in because of the storm, double fucked. They barely managed to flip reserved rooms and didn't have time or resources for some of our in house guests but did provide fresh towels.

3. Hot water was fixed the next morning.

Either way I guess the message and his bad review made my GM finally snap. Her reply reads as follow:

""Dear guest,

I understand that you weren't happy about the situation, but things do happen sometimes that are out of our control. Please kindly do not tell me how to manage my property.

We have been respectful and to all our guests that night who were affected. We refunded them, had a few laughs about it with them. They understood that it was due to the extreme cold. When I did receive the call about the issue, it was midnight and let me tell you that none of the plumbers that I called answered me. We are in \[The great North\].

Also we did not charge you for both nights. Furthermore, the water was fixed the very next morning. So before you decide to be mean or lie make sure you do it for the right reasons.

Regards,

GM.""

My GM is extremely nice and good humoured; I've never even seen her mad like, ever so this really surprised me. I guess it was the stress of running 2 properties with no PMS. Yeah, our sister property was fucked too.

PMS finally went back up after 4 whole days so all's good. For now.

It's not a huge problem, but I would like the ability to sleep a little bit before tomorrow; we're going on a cave trip while we're here and we have to be there by 10:00 AM, so if it would be possible, could you please ask the people above us to quiet down?""

Just tell me your room number and what direction the noise is coming from! That's all I need! I don't care! You have a right to a quiet room, but I will hang this phone up if you go on for longer than 13 seconds.Every noise complaint",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey all, some folks over at TalesFromSecurity told me to repost this over here, so I'll sub over here as well and see what you guys have to share. Anyhow, here it goes...  
  
So, I finally have a good story to tell in doing hotel security recently.  
  
I got a call last week that a local hotel needed security. They do it on an 'as needed' basis, and I guess Friday was pretty rough with a bunch of drunk parents being loud in their lobby. They have very clearly documented quiet hours, and the owners of that particular site (though it's a chain) are very strict on their quiet hours.  
  
I'm chilling in the lobby on my computer doing some stuff and the front desk gal comes over and says, 'hey we've got a noise complaint from room 245.' Ok, I hop up and head out to see what's what. I get there, and I listen for a bit at room 244. Yep, definitely kids in the room messing around being moderately loud. Now, I don't WANT to do paperwork, so my first step is ALWAYS, knock and talk. Just a ""hey guys, its quiet hours, please keep it down,"" keeps me writing just a line in the log, versus a whole report.  
  
Well someone opens the door, I think it was a girl, looks at me and slowly closes the door without even letting me speak. I'm like, ook, and I knock again. Am ignored. Ok, whatever. I go down to the front desk, call their room phone. No answer. I call again. Phone off the hook. Ok, whatever x2, they quieted down which is ultimately my goal.  
  
About 45 minutes or so later, I see some people at the front desk and I sort of overhear that they are talking about their kids being ""accused"" of being loud or whatever. The adults were off property. The front desk gal said, hey, we had a complaint, I sent security, we have quiet hours. The guy comes over to me, semi-huffy, as if it was completely impossible that his kids were being loud. I told him, listen, it was just a courtesy visit, we're in quiet hours now, we just need them to quiet down. So he argues how it wasn't his kids, it was kids in the hall..basically saying that I can't tell the difference between loud kids behind a door, and kids sitting in a hallway 50 feet away around the corner.  
  
I try to clarify that this is all completely low key, no worries on anything, just quiet down and we're good. [I really didn't want to do a report]. So his wife comes over and enters the bickering, and I clearly say, ""listen, no one cares....no one is in trouble, I didn't even document anything, it was just a courtesy visit to get the kids to quiet down."" Well the mother responds with, 'WELL I CARE!!!!' and ran off in a huff. I really didn't know what they wanted from me at that point, an apology?  
  
Well the mother was so offended that it was considered that her children were being loud, while no adult on property with them mind you, that they insisted on leaving the hotel for another.  
  
I was at the front desk after taking another walk of the property when they checked out. The father goes, 'that will be no charge.' The clerk goes, 'um, ok.' The father then demands a receipt for his free stay....and this killed me. The clerk prints up his ledger for 0 dollars. I turn to her after they left, and I go, ""you didnt refund him did you????"" She says, 'no, I just gave him his ledger, which he owed 0 dollars on [because his room was already paid for before they arrived].' I lost it, and gave her a nod of approval, and then returned to my corner to write a 2 page report that I didn't want to have to do in the first place.Hotel security: family leaves because their kids were loud",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I've posted a few stories on here before and just some background on myself, I work in a rather large, almost luxury level, hotel in a major city's industrial park area. So my hotel tends to be sold out during the weekdays and nearly empty on the weekends. So, of course, our rates drop massively for the 3rd party booking sites. 

However, for this one particular Friday night, that wasn't really the case. 

We were actually pretty close to half-full and it was all due to this one MASSIVE group that was staying with us. We had almost all of our ballrooms and meeting rooms booked up for this one group. I won't go into details on who they are but these people are near secret society level with how many pockets they have their hands in. They are an old school organization with BIG money. So my managers and the sales team really wanted this entire night to be perfect for them. 

You can guess from the title that the night was not perfect. 

This group was due to start their event at 2 pm and keep the party going until 1 am. I came on shift at 2:30 pm. As soon as I walk in the door there is a 5-man drumline and 4 guys playing bagpipes in our restaurant and they are not quiet. The noise from them is so loud that I'm having to scream at guests to check them in. Thankfully, most of my check-ins were more people from this group and were actually happy to see the band. I didn't share their enthusiasm but was grateful no one was upset by it. 

Around 5 pm the band stopped playing and the dinner for the event began. Which meant our entire lobby and restaurant went from a mass parade of people and noise to dead silence. It was ghost town level quiet. I loved it. 

I managed to get the last of my check-ins taken care of, some for the big group and some were 3rd party stays, and even helped a small family gathering that was hosting a little girl's birthday party. Nothing big, just her, her parents and some friends for a pool and pizza party. We don't allow food and drink in the pool area so I let the family use one of the empty meeting rooms that the massive group didn't book. They were grateful and tipped me and the two other staff members who helped them out a nice $10 each. 

The massive group's dinner ended around 7 pm and they consumed our bar and restaurant again. The lobby was bursting with people in fancy dresses, expensive tuxes and lots of red fez hats. (I'm not kidding, they are that kind of old school organization)

By 9 pm they had gone from loud to loud and drunk. My head was beginning to hurt and I asked our Engineer to watch the desk while I ran away to the restroom. I decided to use the restrooms in the pool area so I had an excuse to check on the pool party people. They had already gone to their rooms and another family was using the pool area now. I picked up some towels that had been thrown about and mopped up a few puddles. Then headed on to the restrooms. 

At 9:20 pm, I just finished washing my hands and go to dry them when the lights go out. I first thought that the lights were set to a motion sensor and I just stood still for too long. So I wave my arms about as I walk to the door and the lights don't come on. I open the restroom as the family in the pool starts saying ""It's ok, the power will come back on."" 

I panic. 

I whip out my phone and turn on my flashlight, I walk to the pool area and see the parents and their kid in the water still. I ask if everyone is ok and they say they're fine. I ask them to get out of the water and come to me so that I can lead them out and to their room. I explain that until the power comes back on we need to shut down the pool area. They understood and I shined the light on a clear path and walked them out to the stairwells. Thankfully they were staying on the 3rd floor and our emergency power was working to light the stairwells. 

I met up with our other staff members and the MOD and we discussed what was going on. We thought the massive group must have blown a fuse and our Engineer was already checking on it. Turns out, the entire neighborhood was dark and no one knew why. The group was asking what was going on but most of them were just drunk and confused, not scared or upset. 

Our emergency lights kept a good portion of the restaurant and bar area lit up while my half of the lobby was dark except for some candles and flashlights to light the path to the elevators and stairs. Elevators later came on due to emergency power and our phones as well as one computer at my desk was working. 

After the initial curiosity wore off the entire group was laughing that they party so hard they shut the entire neighborhood down! They were also happy that our bar and restaurant were still open and serving, despite the now limited options. 

Guests were calling from their rooms asking what was going on and after ensuring that they weren't hurt in their rooms I just explained that we were working on it and power would return shortly. 

That answer wasn't enough for this one Entitled Girl. 

EG: ""So when is the power coming back on??"" 

Me: ""We are waiting to hear back from the power company at this time. I can give you a callback and let you know once we have an answer if you'd like."" 

EG: ""Well is the pool closed??"" 

Me: ""Yes miss, we have shut down the pool and fitness area until power can be restored. It's not safe to be in there at this time."" 

EG: ""THIS IS BS!!! I WANT A FULL REFUND RIGHT NOW!!!"" 

Me: ""Miss, I understand you're upset and do apologize for the inconvenience, however, we are not able to make that decision at this time."" 

EG: ""You're not refunding me?!?! I paid a lot of money to stay here!! Either open the pool or give me back my money!!"" 

Me: ""Miss, I cannot do that at this time-"" 

EG: ""I'm sending my boyfriend down there to talk to you! This is unbelievable! He's gonna kick your ass you stupid b\*tch!"" 

She ended the call and I just rolled my eyes. I remembered checking the two of them in. They were staying on a super cheap 3rd party rate and weren't apart of the massive group or the pool party. I pulled up their reservation and quickly wrote down the information needed to hand off to the MOD in case things did get ugly. While doing so, the power company called us with an automated message saying they were working on it. The Engineer also stopped by and told me he saw an update on the power company's website that stated we may get power back around 11:15 pm. 

Seconds after the Engineer walked off, the boyfriend came down to the desk and was running sideways to me and crashed into my desk; almost knocking a lit candle over on me. He was clearly drunk. 

BF: ""Oh, uh, hey. My girlfriend just called down? Can I get your manager's info?"" 

Me: ""Sure, here's my General Manager's business card with my name and title written on the back. I'm the Front Office Supervisor here.""

BF: ""Yeah, cool, thanks. Crazy about the power, do you know what's going on?"" 

Me: ""Actually, after speaking with your girlfriend, the power company called us and informed us that they are working on it. We have the estimate that power will be back on around 11:15 pm."" 

BF: ""Cool cool. Hey, uh, sorry for my girlfriend. She paid and is kinda freaking out on it. But I mean, we did pay a lot."" 

The boyfriend then looked around at the people at the bar and restaurant and realized there was a large fancy party happening over there. 

BF: ""Oh snap...fancy threads. How much did they pay to stay here?"" 

Me: ""A little more than twice what you did."" 

BF, eyes wide: ""Woah...they must be wanting their money back too then huh? I mean, we can't be the only ones asking for a refund right?"" 

Me, smiling: ""No, just you."" 

BF, looking confused: ""Whaaaa? They spent so much though...""

Me, loving this: ""Oh, that's nothing! Our weekday rates are usually 4 times what you paid!"" 

BF, jaw on floor: ""Duuuuude."" 

I was 100% serious and the guy realized it. He then turned and walked into the crowd of people at the restaurant. Sometime later, his girlfriend came down off the elevator looking for him and gave me dagger stares as she stomped into the crowd to find him. I didn't pay much mind to her and went back to what I was doing. 

At 10:30 pm our power came back on and at around 11 pm my bartender came up to me and started unloading on me about how everyone was loving the power outage except this one young couple who she and her staff never served, but were clearly wasted and tried to order drinks. She turned them away because the guy was in a t-shirt and swim trunks while the girl was wearing a bikini with a tank top over it. 

Our restaurant does have a dress code, so does the bar. You can't be dressed like that and expect to be served.

I laughed and told her about the angry phone call I got from the bikini girl wanting a refund. My bartender gaped and then told me she overheard them arguing after she turned them away from the bar. The girlfriend tried to argue with my bartender about being turned away and the boyfriend went pale and dragged her away when he realized they were being stared at and laughed at by all the people in the ""fancy threads"". 

My bartender told me their argument was more the boyfriend begging to either go back to the room or go home. The girlfriend was fuming and wanted her refund. The boyfriend offered to pay her back and she accused him of being embarrassed of her. He actually nodded and said ""YES!"" loudly and in her face. She shoved him and ran off angry. 

They must have made up later on because before I left I saw them playing around in the pool....after hours. I told my security guy to just leave it be for another hour but to keep an eye on them. I got told later they just went to their room a little while after I left, tried to do a late checkout and were denied, trashed the hotel room and did call my GM wanting a refund. My GM heard the story from me and just shrugged it off, and let me make the phone call explaining that not only was her request denied but due to her behavior on property she isn't welcome back. 

I love my job. :)The entire neighborhood is blacked out?? REFUND ME!!!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So a few weeks ago my area was hit with a blizzard. We were allowing guests to cancel without penalty as long as it wasn't a pre-paid or third party reservation. The catch was they actually had to call us though. Now this woman claims she called us to cancel, but her reservation was marked as a no-show. I was going to give her the information to speak with our accounting department until she said that she disputed the charge with her credit card company and they denied her dispute. At that time I told her that by disputing the charge with her credit card company she took her dispute out of our hands. If her credit card company sided with us then there is literally nothing we can do. 

She became a real Karen at the situation because then she was threatening with a lawsuit and my response was that she needs to have her lawyer call our legal department. Their lawyer can look up that information with our registered agent. Funny thing is she just said that this was bad service. I mean she may have gotten her money back if she called us first and somebody at central forgot to cancel the reservation, but I think she never called to cancel.Guest calls for refund after losing dispute with credit card company",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm sitting at the desk, minding my own business. In walks a guy who looks like he likes crack a little bit too much. He tries giving me a series of prepaid cards, as well as his plasma card and social security card in lieu of a bank or credit card for a deposit.

Eventually he understands that I'm not going to check him in without one, and I send him along to the slightly sketchier hotel down the road that doesn't require a card.

But five minutes later he's back, trying to pay a cash deposit. I reiterate that we have to have a card, we don't do cash deposits. His friend comes up behind him, trying to argue. Insisting that we *do* take cash deposits.

&gt;Bran- I'm sorry, I've been here two and a half years, so it's been at least that long since they stopped doing cash deposits.

&gt;Liar- I've definitely paid a cash deposit here since then. Matter of fact, YOU have taken a cash deposit from me.

&gt;Bran- No I didn't, we don't do cash deposits.

&gt;Liar- It's been a few months, but you did.

&gt;Bran- Yeah, that didn't happen.

&gt;Liar- I swear to you, you took a cash deposit.

&gt;Bran- How much was the deposit?

&gt;Liar- I don't remember.

&gt;Bran- Because it didn't happen?

With impeccable timing, my boss walks in through the front door, completely oblivious to the conversation occurring, and staring at his phone.

&gt;Bran- Hey boss, you'd better fire me. I guess I've been taking cash deposits.

&gt;Boss, looking up from his phone confused- Huh? We don't take cash deposits.

At this point, the liar gave up and left.

"Some background: I work at a small boutique hotel in the heart of downtown in a city. Parking is a premium, and we offer guests one free parking spot either on site (in our small 12 car garage) or across the street (in a larger parking garage not even a minute walk from the hotel). This parking is first come first serve. We also tend to attract wealthier clients even though our prices are pretty reasonable. I have been working here for 7 months and have become mostly immune to the entitledness some guests feel they have. Mostly.  

To the story.

Back during my training, I was working one of our busy nights. One where every room is checking in all in one night. Things are going smoothly, my coworker and I are shooting the breeze and bonding over tv shows probably. It's 10 PM and we only have a few more people to check in. All of our onsite parking was taken within the first hour of check in but everyone, for the most part, has been understandable and parked across the street with ease. We also have too many people left to check in to warrant giving away our temporary parking to those left to check-in, like we usually do for people coming in super late.

Well, my coworker and I notice that this Jeep Wrangler tears into our parking lot and pulls into our one handicap parking spot. All of our temporary spots are open and that is where you are supposed to park when checking in and awaiting assigned parking. 

This woman and her daughter get out of the car and they start unpacking. My coworker sets his jaw and goes outside to talk to them. I watch on our cameras as this lady argues with my coworker, and all my coworker can do is use his hospitality voice/demeanor. They both come in, he handles her check in, and you can tell that both of them are pissed. My coworker later tells me that the woman was outside insisting that she get to park in handicap because she ""called ahead and should get a spot on site"", wasn't moving to temporary, and was fine parking in handicap, even though handicap parking was already assigned for the night AND she had no handicap tags. We finally got her to move to temp parking. 

I distinctly remember her and what she looked like because I drew a quick caricature sketch of her for my coworker to make him feel better. 

Fast forward to now. That coworker is one of my best friends. He doesn't work here anymore but I still give him updates on the shittiest people who come in. Well, on the guest list for this shift I notice that someone had a request of ""onsite parking if possible"". My gut reaction now for when someone requests onsite parking is to silently hope that we are out for the night, because it's first come first serve. I don't make the rules but I certainly will follow them. 

Well this person walks in and low and behold it's the woman from training. I bet I could still recognize her even 10 years from now. She immediately makes a remark about her having a bigger bag (I think to rag on her husband for not carrying all thier luggage himself) and as I check her in she tells me that the man who made her reservation GAURANTEED her parking on site. I had to fight to hard to not politely tell her that was bullshit. And I wish that we were busier tonight so I could have made her park somewhere else. But alas. I couldn't. And this second interaction further solidified that entitlment and bitchiness are character traits of hers, not a one time happening. 

I texted my coworker about her being back and still being entitled. He still remembered her. Fingers crossed she doesn't get pissed becuase we don't have wine or something.

"So I’m working the front desk of our hotel and a nicely dressed/fresh haircut kid maybe 7 comes to the desk alone and ask me to grab something from the market as he can’t reach it. 

Sure! I go out there and he asks for the Easy Mac. How much, he asks? $2.50 I tell him, expecting him to say to put it on his room and me having to tell him I need his parents permission. Nope, little dude pulls out a wallet from his back pocket flips through his cash and gives me a five! 

I ask if he needs help making it? I just need some water please. I grab a water bottle,  mix it and put it in the micro as he can’t reach that either. I go behind the desk to wait the 3.5 minutes while it cooks before I have to take it out. 

Little dude pulls out his iPhone and I’m pretty sure he was buying and selling some stocks as he leaned casually against the market as it cooked. Timer went off, I went out and removed it from the micro. Thank you I have it from here, he says.

"I first posted this story at [r/EntitledPeople](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/), but someone in the comments surgested I posted it here aswell. So here it goes.

I work at in hotel in Scandinavia. And this happend just last week.

It is January, and it is normal that it rains and really windy. That week it had been raining and storming almost 24/7. The hotel is fully booked (we had a overbooking of 2 rooms), so I am happely checking guest in and talking about the 'great weather' we have etc etc.

I see one of our elevators open, and out comes entitled guest (EG). He waits in my line (about 3 guests). I make check them in and then turn my attention to EG.

Here is what whent down:

Me: Hi, how are you? (We are a very casual hotel)

EG: I need a new room!

Me: A new room? We are fully booked, so I can't move you to a new room. I'm sorry. But what is wrong with your room?

EG: But I can't sleep (it was around 8 o'clock in the evening), because the rain is making so much noise on my window.

Me: I'm sorry, but as I said, we are fully booked, so I can't give another room.

EG: But I need a new room, the rain is very loud!

Me: I'm so sorry, but I can't move you to a new room. We are fully booked! And if I could move you to another room, away from the wind. Then I would have to move you again in an hour or two, due to the change of wind. I'm sorry, but I just can't move you.

EG: But I was in another room last week, and it was also raining and there was no noise.

Me: Yes, it was raining a lot last week. But this week it storms aswell. Last week there was NO wind.

EG: (looks very crumpy) Well then I won't get any sleep!

Me: I'm sorry about that. I can maybe find you something to put in your ears, to block out the noise?

EG: Then I wont hear my alarm clock.

Me: Sorry, then I can't do anything.

EG crumples something in his native language and leaves. I turn around catches me co-workers eye and we just start laughing. I crap the phone and pretend to call the weather gods, and demands them to stop with the rain, because my guest can't sleep! And we laugh even more. One of our regular guest see us laughing, ask what so funny, I tell him the story and he burst out with laughter!

I finish my shift, about an hour later. Walks to my car. AND. GUESS. WHAT? It has stopped raining! I thank the weather gods, and drives home with a big smile.Guest complaines about the rain",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

So this is my first time posting to this subreddit and it doesn’t really correlate with the FD but I figured this would be the closest thing, I work as a receptionist for a company that works with kids and have to deal with entitled parents and crazy employees

A previous employee after having called several times in the past week in regards to some issue comes into our office with this entitled air asking for one of my coworkers we’ll call DW who works in HR to come speak with her in regards to workers comp. We’ll call the previous employee EB.

Me: Hi how can I help?

EB: *with condescending tone* Hi I need to speak to DW

Me: sure...what for?

EB: *sighing* in regards to my workers comp.

Me: ok one sec and your name?

EB: EB

I nod and roll off (I’m currently in a wheelchair) to talk to my coworker (I could have just called her from my phone but the chick was rubbing me the wrong way)

Me: hey EB is up front asking for you in regards to her workers comp 

DW: bro this girl is getting on my nerves tell her I don’t have time for her rn because I am literally head deep in paperwork I gotta deal with, take a message and I’ll get back to her

Me: so basically transfer her to your vm?

DW: yes basically, people think just because they come in person they can demand that I see them, let her know I can’t help her rn

I head out the HR dept and take my time going around the building back to the front desk

Me: Hey sorry for the wait unfortunately DW can’t come so she asked me to take a message for her and she’ll get back to you

EB: you’re telling me she can’t spare two seconds to talk to me? I’ve been doing this since last March and we’re almost in February blah blah blah if this ruins my credit score I’m going to have to sue blah blah your company is supposed to cover my bills

Me: I get that it’s been a long process *insert some sympathy lines to at least be nice* but she’s unavailable at the moment and can’t assist

As she says all this she stands from where she’s sitting and comes to stand up in front of my desk to look down at me

EB: and you’re telling me she can’t even tell me that herself? That’s so fucking ridiculous why can’t you just pay for my bills and be done with it. I’m sick of this company and I want to speak to DW

Me: I’m genuinely sorry but that’s all the information I can provide you, she’s unavailable and can’t help you right now.

After that she swirls around and states with so much venom to have a nice day that it almost makes me laugh.

Afterwards I find out that she had to go to the hospital because she was doing backflips while working with the kids (even though we tell them not to mess around with the kids) and we weren’t responsible for paying her bills but rather a third party.

"So this story popped up into my head today. It's an oldie but a goodie from the first hotel I worked at, and I promise 1) it's all 100% true and 2) it's not what you're thinking!

I used to work at a Frampton Inn with suites in my hometown, which is basically an overgrown desert populated with retirees. It was summer time, and a woman and her two kids were in town to visit their grandparents; however, the kids were eager to use our outdoor pool and persuaded their mom into taking a dip before they went to visit. So there the three of them were, in their pool attire, attempting not to burn their feet as they tried to figure out how to open the pool door (it was unlocked but sometimes needed a good push). Seeing them struggle from the front desk, I called over to my manager to let her know I was going outside to help our guests get into the pool area, and swiftly left while she covered me. I apologized for the inconvenience the door had caused the woman and helped her and her kids in.

We stood around for a moment or two exchanging pleasantries and discussing the reason for their travels when one of her kids shouts out ""Hey lady! There's a lizard in the pool!"" So she and I go over to investigate and sure enough, there was a lizard, about 7 inches long from nose to tail, lying on its back on the third step. Seeing that the kids were kind of upset and unsure of what to do, we encouraged one of them to scoop it up for us because 1) it's a dead lizard in the pool and 2) the younger one was a little freaked out at this point. The older one was hesitant at first, but I promised it wouldn't bite him if that's what he was worried about (I mean, it looked dead and immobile), which seemed to be enough for him to gather his courage and get it. Afterwards, he passed it over to me, where it rolled limply into the palm of my hand.

Now all 4 of us were gathered around this poor lizard, which was blue, cold, and for all intents and purposes was dead. Seeing that the kids were upset over its lifelessness, I attempted to revive it. I covered it with my hands in hopes of warming it up. No dice. We walked it over to a sunnier spot in hopes that would warm it up or wake it up. Nope. And that's when it hit me: chest compressions. 

I looked at the lady and half jokingly said that I was going to give it CPR. So I rolled it over onto its back, placed my index finger between its abdomen and chest and gave it a couple little pushes. Seriously you guys, I wasn't expecting anything, but I kid you not, that damn lizard's eyes and mouth opened wide and a spurt of water shot out! The mom and I stood there with our mouths open in disbelief while the kids jumped up excitedly. I had somehow managed to bring it back to life! 

We stood like that for another couple seconds unsure of what to do, while the little creature continued to breath in my hand and its naturally brown color started to return. The mom and I, now laughing over the whole thing, decided it was best to return it to its natural habitat. So I looked at the kids and told them I was going to place it on a rock in the planter area on the outskirts of the pool in hopes it could recover and warm up in the sun. The younger one said ""Don't worry lady, we'll make sure he doesn't get back in the pool."" And with that, I snapped a quick picture of it and returned to the front desk where I relayed the event to my manager. If it weren't for the fact that the kids came back in to tell me it ran off into the bushes, I don't think she would've believed me!

Oh, and I also gave them each a small bag of toffee from our loyalty box as a reward for helping me save the lizard. Good deeds don't go unrewarded when I'm working!That Time I Used CPR",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

No...I said no such thing.  He told me he was needing to plan out his next move and wanted somewhere to wait while he contacted someone to come get him.  I said yes to *that,* not to staying overnight until morning.

\&gt;Okay, well, should I kick him out?

Do what you feel is best.  If you feel unsafe, then that's up to you; your safety comes first.

\&gt;Okay, I'll follow my spidey tingle.

I have your back.

\&gt;Thanks! Bye!

Bye

\-- I walk back over to the gentleman who is now sitting up and awake, and give him my take on the situation.

Hi, Sir.  I just got off the phone with my manager, and unfortunately I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

\&gt;This is unacceptable.  Who are you?

Proceeds to give him my name and position at the hotel

\&gt;I'm a SUA member!  You can't treat me like this!  I've stayed with the brand all around the world!  I just happen to have ran into a bit of a snag with travel plans and need to regroup.

Well, sir, I can get you into a room that would be more to your comfort level.

\&gt;I'm fine right where I am.

But sir, I can't have you sleeping in my lobby.  I'm sorry.

\&gt;This is very unprofessional of you to bully me after your manager said it was fine for me to stay here until the morning.

Sir...I am not bullying you and my manager did not give you permission to sleep in our lobby.  Now, I need you to leave or I'll have to call the police.

\&gt;THE POLICE!?! Well now you've just gone a bridge too far!

\-- At this point he starts throwing out the names of the owner's of the brand, and saying something about stockholders, and knowing this person of influence and this person of means... yet he called not one of these people he has name dropped to get him a room.  Interesting.

Well, sir, you said I was bullying, so I think that police intervention would be in your best interest and mine at this point.

\&gt;You know something?  You're a piece of work.  What is your name?  GIVE ME YOUR NAME!

I've told you my name already sir, but you'll see it in writing on your copy of the police report.

\&gt;This will not go unheard of.  Very unprofessional.  This is NOT how you treat a (SUA) member!   He says all of this as he pulls his luggage behind him out of the door.

Man!  The shits that go on in a hotel overnight.  WTF?!?!SUPERNOVA UNICORN AFTERLIFE MEMBER...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I used to manage a large public county owned campground and park/forest.  The place was mostly visited by locals and i never had issues with most of them (except horse riders, fuck you, but thats another story.). Every once in awhile we would get out of towners. Everyone in wisconsin who works in the tourism industry can tell you the people from IL are the worst. We have tons of special names and terms for them.

One day during peak season, I had all the 109 sites full. With only me or my assistant working one at a time. (FYI the park had over 2000 acres) I am driving back from selling firewood and have tons of things to do as can be expected. 

I get flagged down by a woman who has a concern about the safety of the site she is in.  I dont know what she is talking about so i drop everything to meet her there. She points up and mentioned the tree above her campsite is squeeking and is afraid its limbs will fall off and kill them all in their sleep.

I look up and one branch was rubbing on another when the wind would blow. This happens all the time in nature. It doesnt mean the limb is gonna fall or the tree is gonna die. I looked at the tree and up at the branches and it was perfectly healthy. 

I honestly didnt know if she was joking or not, maybe  Then I looked at her plates on her camper and saw she was from IL and knew she was serious from the blank dumb look on her face. 

At this point i was fed up. On average each site had 3 people at it. This means i was had over 330 other guests to also be concerned about in those 2000 acres of forest, and this FIB was bitching about a squeeky tree.  

The only think that my brain could come up with was. ""Sorry Ma'am, this is an elm tree and all i have in Maple tree oil. I'll ask my boss to bring some out tomorrow.""

I then drove away, leaving her with that same dumb look, this time she was the one unsure as to weather i was joking or not. 

Honestly I was hoping she was going to complain to my boss. My boss was about to retire and had no shits left to give and would have probably laughed out loud while on the phone with her, then hung up.  

I have a ton more interesting stories to share of people are interested. Including such regular characters like ""old drunk swingers"", ""native americans are actually persian dude"", ""the campground whore"", and of course those damn horse people.

EDIT: Just to give you an idea, taking the time to do this meant a 20min drive from my office, out to her site, 5-10mins of dealing with her and 20mins back to my office, which means she wasted about 1/8 of my work day on that alone. This was halfway through my day meaning it was even harder to keep caught up on my normal work load at that point.Sorry Ma'am, I am out of Maple Tree Oil",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Tl;dr at the bottom.

Just so everyone knows before reading this, this is not a a full on story but more of a rant. I'm not sure if this is really allowed here so if there is a more specific sub for this let me know, but mainly I'm posting this just to blow off some steam. I'll do my best to not make this crazy long, so sit back and listen to my ""woe is me"" rant... Or don't, I'm not your mother.

A little over a year ago I graduated college and moved a couple states away (for personal reasons) and was in need of a job quickly. I found a hotel that was looking for people, was able to a get an interview the same day I filled out an application, and that is where I am to this day.

Throughout the time I have been here I have experienced.

Cheap ownership (That could be a post of its own)

Illegal business transactions

Shaving of Overtime hours

GM change

Our sales director quitting

Piss poor maintenance (both the upkeep of the hotel and our actual maintenance person)

Lazy housekeepers

Everyone that worked here when I started leaving

And everyone that replaced those people leaving as well.. except for one person, and that is where this rant truly begins.

About 7 months ago, the GM that hired me was fired and honestly I was pretty happy about this, the dude was a total ass and would tell you to something one way and get pissed when you didn't do it the other way, but I digress. Ownership brought in a new GM on the spot from one of his other properties and she was pretty cool, she took no bullshit from anyone and it actually seemed like we were going to have a GM that had a backbone... Notice that I am using past tense here because my first impression was dead wrong.

When this GM came over from another property she brought someone with her to fill up another front desk position, and for the sake of this post lets call this guy Richard.

Richard is a total dick.

From when Richard first started working to now, I have seen all the OG crew slowly start to leave but good ole Dicky boy has stayed, and this guys is piece of work. He is always late, assigns people to incorrect rooms, has piss poor customer service, nothing is EVER his fault, has a shitty work ethic, and now he is on a major power trip. I could go on and on about it but this post would get lengthy quick, fast and in a hurry.

There were multiple times where I really wanted to quit on the spot and that be the end of it, but unfortunately paying bills is a thing, so I couldn't quit until I found a new job. I didn't look too hard because I found out that my Front Office Manager at the time was leaving at the beginning of the new year and I was told by multiple sources, the GM being one of them, that I was going to take over as FOM. I was happy with this so I toughed it out for a couple more months, went on vacation for two weeks to visit family over Christmas and New Years and when I came back to work I would be promoted. At least that's what I thought. 

While I was gone, the sales director quit on the spot for ownership pushing her over the edge, and the Front Office Manager quite a week before they were actually suppose to leave also because of ownership. I got all this information on New Years Eve, in text format, at 11 at night, while I was piss drunk. I was a little stressed the next couple of days preparing myself to go back to work and deal with all the chaos that happened while I was gone. Oh, also during this time while I was away the hotel hired someone and then fired them soon after they were hired, so we still needed some spots to fill.

So I come back from vacation, feeling recharged and ready for the new year. In the past I worked night audit and afternoon shifts, but now my schedule was strictly mornings since our FOM was gone. I wake up bright and early, get to work on time, meet the new night audit hire and waited for my GM to come in, but she never showed. 

Instead I get a text from her saying that she will be working at another property (her original property she was at) because that GM over there quit, and ownership wants her to work both properties now.

WHAT. THE. FUCK.

So I strap myself in for a stressful couple of weeks and get to work. My GM told me that I need to post hiring ads online, make the schedule, train the new hires she made when I was gone, and pretty much do sales (Yeah we still don't have a sales director), and she pretty much said that I am running the show now. To me that sounds like I am officially the new FOM, right? Wrong... oh, so so so wrong.

I know I said this rant begins with Richard, and this is where shit really hits the fan so here we go.

For a couple weeks things were going well, I was getting into the groove of things and training up the new hires that I hired, of course had to confirm with the GM before hiring anyone. Life was good, until one night while I'm home enjoying the evening, I get a text from good ole Richard saying that he made the schedule for the next week... Well this isn't good, since I have already made the schedule for the month that way everyone knows that they are working and can plan accordingly. I don't respond and leave to talk to my GM in the morning.

I come in the next day and ask her if she can come by the property real quick so I could speak with her about some things. She shows up, and we sit down and talk it out.I told her about Richard's text he sent me and I straight up ask her if I am the new FOM since I haven't been specifically told but with the tasks she has given me it was very much implied. This is how the conversation went down.

**GM**: There is no front office manager, I am having you do things to help me and I am having Richard do things to help me.

**Me**: Okay... well then who is suppose to make the schedule then since there is no manager, you had asked me to do it so thought it was my duty to make it.

**GM**: You and Richard need to figure that out yourselves, I don't have time to deal with drama between you two.

**Me**: Okay... Well, then what is my role here since I am doing manager duties AND sales.

**GM:** You are just helping me out, that's all.

And that was pretty much the end of the conversation, I got no real answers and nothing has been resolved.

I forgot to mention that since this GM started working here she has talked mad shit about Richard, saying that he is unreliable, is clueless most of the time, never on time, and asshole and that she needs to get rid of him... so why the fuck is he not gone yet?

Anyways, I work the rest of my shift and wait for Richard to come in so we can hash this scheduling thing out. He shows up, late as usual, and I sit down with him to talk this out.

**Me:** Alright, so things haven't been communicated well between us about what our roles are so lets hash this out like adults. GM had asked me to make the schedule the past couple of weeks so I was under the impression it was my job to do so moving forward. Is that going to be a problem?

**Richard:** Yeah, I want to make the schedule because you have not given me a weekend off and you are trying to screw me over.

First off, I am doing a trickle down schedule where everyone gets equal amount of weekends off, that way no one is pissed that they worked most weekends while someone else hasn't worked any. It worked really well at the job I was at before the hotel so I imputed it here. If he looked ahead another week he would have seen he would have weekends off and I would be working weekends. I tried explaining this to Richard but his small peanut brain couldn't comprehend it.

**Me:** Fine, how bout this. We both work on the schedule together. You make a mock schedule and I make one, and we sit down and work together to get it sorted out, deal? But for the next week the schedule has already been made and approved by everyone working, so we are going to go with that one for now since it is already out, sound good?

**Richard:** Fine.

And that was that, I left for home and enjoyed my day. I thought all was solved and there would be no drama in the work place.

Everything was good, until last night.

I get a text from Richard saying that the schedule that was put up was not the one he made. Again I explained to him that we agreed on working together on the schedule and also the one that was already up was staying, and he agreed to it.

Of course knucklehead fought back and was being a full blown Richard to the point where I just said, ""Fuck it, if you want to make the schedule then go right ahead, this is isn't worth fighting over"". Then I call my GM and fill her in on things, letting her know that I tried to reason with Richard and nothing seems to work, and he has gone power hungry. I told her that she needs to give us both defined roles and non of this ""work it out together crap"" because I've tired that and it hasn't worked yet. Then she goes and tells me she doesn't have time for this drama, and to (say it with me folks) figure it out yourselves.

I realize that I am not going to get the answers I want, and things are just going to keep getting worse. I should have left a long time ago. There is no communication between anyone here, no room for growth, ownership sucks, there is no manager on duty ever, no raises (Oh yeah I have worked here for a year and have not gotten a raise, and I've asked multiple times), and overall just a toxic environment. After yesterday I was sent over the edge and immediately went out looking for jobs and filling out applications like a mad man.

I know it might seem like I am overreacting a bit, I get that there are much worse working conditions, but I am just scratching the surface here. There is so much I want to say but this post would be a freaking book.

So yeah, I'm working on getting out of a toxic work environment and I recommend those who are in the same boat do the same. Seems like every time things get somewhat better, something stupidly outrageous happens that just nullifies everything.

"Our town has a large construction project just getting started from the smile company. It's a two year project with two ten man crews currently in town until at least August. As an extended stay property, this is exactly what we want in house. Unfortunately, the Long Stay USA property bid them a bottom of the barrel $32/night rate, with zero amenities, no housekeeping, no breakfast, only allowed to swap towels once a week, prepay a month at a time, kinda deal.

We want this business, badly. We've offered them a higher rate, with extended early breakfast hours, extended dinner hours, and housekeeping once a week. They also don't have to prepay a month at a time with me. We've managed to get two guys to come over, but that's it, so we resorted to a tried and true business stealing move...

"Where are the towels? I don't know, and the boss doesn't seem to care. Let me start over.

I'm at a small Evenings Out with 60 rooms. We have a little closet here by the front desk where we keep the extra towels. There's bath towels, bathmats, hand towels, and washrags, or at least there should be. Last night I came in, and the thing was empty. A regular asked for an extra washrag, and when I said I'd go check the maid cart, he said not to worry about it. Crisis averted. So tonight, I had someone call.asking for two extra towels. I went to the closet, and what do you know, still completely empty. I went out to the downstairs maid cart: one freaking towel. I came back in and called the owner/manager, who lives upstairs. Despite living in America for many years, they either still cannot sense irritation in an American's voice, or maybe they just don't care, but they just tell me to check the downstairs maid cart. I explain I already have, and they tell me to check the upstairs one. Luckily there was another single towel up there. So I got two towels for the guest finally.

The thing is, I don't have any idea where the towels went, and the boss didn't volunteer any info about it. We should have a ton of extra towels. I checked the laundry room, there's a few in the washing machine, but that's only a fraction of the extra towels we should have.

"So today is the day after income support/handicapped assistance payments were released, which means one of my properties usually gets an influx of people looking for rooms.  I work Night Audit, so I generally get the drunks.  Lucky me.  


The first guy in my story smells like he just climbed out of a vat of whiskey, and his girlfriend's teeth were fucking horrifying.  Grey and black jagged spikes of bone, I'm not being hyperbolic when I say Gollum has better chompers.  That's not relevant really, but whew.  Go to the dentist folks, please.  


Anyways, this guy comes in, asks for a room.  I say sure, can I see your ID?  in-between him mumbling half of his answers and me having to repeat myself to make myself understood through his drunken haze/broken hearing aid, he eventually gets across that he has no ID.  Its okay though, because he's ""in the system"".  I show him the rules clearly posted on the wall behind me, valid government photo ID is required.  Once again, he's in our computers he says.  I try to explain that anyone could say that, he doesn't really understand until the third of forth time I say this.  He then tells me to phone the manager.  At 2:30am.  I'm obviously not going to wake up the manager to tell this guy exactly what I'm telling him.  He eventually realizes I'm not going to rent a room, and leaves angrily.  


End of the story right?  Wrong.  He comes back about fifteen minutes later, says literally the exact same shit, I tell him the exact same shit, and he leaves yet again.  However, this time he says some random people outside that are smoking a cig, and manages to con them into helping him.  See, shortly after he leaves my office a guest walks in and says she wants to check in her friends that are staying in her room.  This lady is someone (with ID!) that I checked in yesterday, but I know right away what's going on, and inform her that sorry, but said guy and his lady can't stay without ID, even under your name.  What would happened if they trashed the room, stole the TV?  Do you really wanna be the hook for that?  Well, she seemed to accept this and left, and I figured they'd finally get the hint and move on.  


Nope.  They came in a third time, and asked for a room once again.  However, after turning them down yet again and explaining why, this guy finally started to get in.  I called them a cab and they left.  


And then about 20 minutes ago another cab pulls up with a different guy.  He drunkenly explains that he's stayed here before, and shows me a debit card with his name on it as ID.  Ugh.  He keeps shoving this card in my face say that because his name is on it that's proof, and that how could he know the pin if he weren't that guy?  This motherfucker does not take no for an answer.  I must have said you must have photo ID about no less than 20-fucking-times before his lady comes in and seems to understand.  They leave for another, shittier place but not before calling me a fat bitch.

"Hey all! I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit and have been working at my current hotel now for about a year and I haven't had any experiences that were worth posting until tonight. Just a little context, my hotel is a pretty mid-tier hotel, standard 3/4 star chain I'm sure you all could probably guess the name if I gave you three chances. Anyway, we get B-list celebrities pretty often because we're close to a performance center and so I've had my fair share of over inflated non-deserving entitlement, but this one takes the cake. For the past couple of days we have been hosting the studio team for a pretty popular TV show and the director is an absolute asshole. My hotel is in desperate need of renovation which is well on its way so the carpets are a little stained, the key system is pretty bad so keys don't work often, and we have a ""signature brand"" scent we use for our lobby and IMHO smells like BO, but we have a really great accommodating front desk team who is able to make guests overlook these things, but it isn't enough for this man. Before working today, I had been off for a few days and my fellow front desk agents warned me about him, but I did not heed their warnings enough. It's about 8pm and I see this man huffing and puffing coming up to the front desk. He slams the keys down in front me and goes

FD - ""I'm sorry sir, I'll be sure to pass it on"" 

AH - "" You won't be passing it on, i'll be here in the morning to be sure my pretty smile jolts them awake."" 

At this point I am honestly in such belief. This man is literally a psycho. I can't put together the words to describe his whiny bitch attitude. ""I'm working on bettering myself but at this point.."" I mean c'mon y'all ..what even is that.

"My hotel offers airport parking where you can book the park and go package with your room or parking alone online thru a 3rd party so you can either stay with us for the night and take the shuttle to the airport or park your car and take the shuttle to the airport right away. 

I was checking in a guest and everything was going smooth and they mention about parking for 3 weeks. I double checked their reservation and noticed it was booked 3rd party and it was clearly not the park and go package. I asked for a receipt for the parking and than they got offended I asked that because they were given the courtesy to park here for free before. They didn’t know any employees names and I had no idea who they are. I text my manager what is the policy with airport parking and asked if if she knew who this guest was, obviously she didn’t. I fired back saying my manager says to follow policy and I can’t override a manager. 

They than asked to speak with a manager. It was 8pm and I am the manager on duty. I told my coworkers to not intervene in this at all because I know one of them will bend over for them because he’s such a push over. They kept telling me a story about how last time they stayed here in December they were able to park here for free. I asked for the employees name and managers name that told them this and they didn’t know. They address these people that told him as the guy and gal. I told them the policy had never been like that and who ever told you may have let it slept behind them. He and his wife karen started to get mad at me because Why am I and the hotel enforcing this policy right now? I mention to them I’ve been working here for 2 years and the policy has always been the same. We been cracking down on the airport parking because of people taking advantage of it so they’re is no way any body could’ve told him differently. They started mentioning how they been staying here for more than 2 years and I mention how their hotel rewards only bring up them staying in December and nothing past that. Than they gave me another story about how the employees were shocked how they weren’t rewards members already and they should sign up right which explains why their names only go as far as December. 

At this point I’m sticking to policy since there’s no way I’m going to let these people get free parking because 3 weeks of free parking is insane. They started mentioning another story about past experiences they were treated wonderfully and I’m making a huge mistake enforcing this policy. I kept mentioning the policy is policy and I can’t not override a managers decision. The wife started yelling at me saying how in the past this has never been a issue until they ran into me. They confessed to paying for parking before and we all of a sudden recently started telling them they didn’t need to pay for parking. 

At this point I do what I do best and become the bigger person. Not by bending over but by not kicking them out and having the police involved. The husband started threatening legal action against the hotel and me if I don’t give him free parking. He started saying I better start filling out applications for other jobs because I could kiss my job goodbye. I kept saying policy is policy while texting my manager a update about how they’re threatening legal action. He made it such a point to have legal action against me and I will be sorry for it. Thinking back now I should’ve kicked him out but I wanted a managers permission first before I did that. 

At this point it’s been a hour of back and forth and other guest in the lobby walking by show clear signs of being uncomfortable. My coworkers aren’t getting involved and letting me handle it like I said they should let me. I restate policy is policy and I can’t not override a managers decision and I start to retell how the airport parking works to educate them on how it really works and mention my managers name. 

Mentioning my managers name was a bad idea. I should’ve used a random person’s name and call them out saying this person doesn’t exist I mention a random name to catch them lying because they kept saying they know who she is and my manager said she doesn’t. He insisted I give my manager their number because they need to have a chat with a manager about how I am unfairly treating them. I got into full policy mode and say a manager is not available to speak with them currently because they aren’t on property. They will need to be on the clock to talk to you. He wasn’t listening to that and his wife was going ape shit in the back. Their daughter was just sitting in one of the hotel lobby chairs. 

At this point I went back to my fav customer service video with the guest calling the front person the hard r word and gave the guest the managers and assistant managers business card because as of now it’s above me if they don’t want to listen to me. The wife was then demanding a refund and I mention how I can waive and cancel the reservation if they decide to go somewhere else. I than mention since it’s a 3rd party reservation they need to contact who ever they booked the room with for a refund. The wife got mad and said,”no this is unfair, you’re dumping this all on them because you don’t want to help us.” 

The husband came back firing at me saying if they can prove they stayed here in the past will I change the policy just for him to get free parking. I tell him no policy is policy. Again he mention how I’m making a huge mistake again enforcing this policy he’s never been aware of even tho they both mention how they did before pay for parking and now they don’t have to which means they have been stealing from the hotel. 

Again, everyone should know airport parking is about $10-20 a day in the city where I work. Why would a airport property offer free parking? It sounds insane to be able to leave your car for free for god knows how many weeks. Im glad if you call the hotel and you ask if the airport parking is too good to be true that you’re able to park at a way cheaper price than the airport parking garage and have a shuttle take you to your terminal gate.

At this point the husband says I have tunnel vision because I’m not seeing the big picture here because of his threats of legal action. I don’t budge because my hotel is behind a very well known brand and their team of lawyers will destroy him if he even decides to take legal action. He walked away and said he knew the minute he walked into the hotel that I look like I wouldn’t cut him a deal. At that point I’m like I think he just called me a bitch. Him and his wife kept yelling at me I’m making a huge mistake and I ruin their vacation to Hawaii and how I’m going to go home and think all of This could’ve been avoided if I just let him park for free. Right before they leave I tell them to have a wonderful night. Husband gets mad and fires back “OH NO WE ARENT”

10-15 mins later the daughter comes in saying she knows how her dad gets and she doesn’t believe he handled it correctly and she believes I didn’t handle it correctly and that since they were given the option to park here for free for how many weeks as long as they stay here why can’t I just let it pass now for them. In my head I’m literally fucking laughing. They’re going to have their daughter sweet talk me and mention to her that policy is policy and I can’t override the managers decision and contacting the manager is the best option for this issue. 

At this point it’s been about 2 hours of this and another coworker came to relieve me but I stayed to fill out a report about what just happened . Daughter kept asking the same question and I just explained in detail what my manager said which was clearly policy is policy and to Contact them they will be here at 9 am in the morning to deal with their concerns. When i first mention that to the husband he fired back we can’t call because “we will be in HAWAII!!”.  

Being the bigger person like I said before since she says they don’t want to book some where else I mention that they are more than welcome to stay here since they are check into their rooms currently. She mentions to me they don’t think they have keys and I remake them for her and in the end the dad comes back to the front desk to pay for the 3 weeks of parking and later calls the front desk to put down what time he wants to take the shuttle to the airport like nothing ever happen. 

So In the end they ended up paying for parking and taking the shuttle at 5am to the airport.Guest tries to have his daughter sweet talk me after threatening to sue me.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guest literally walks up to the desk. I ask if they're checking in. He says, ""Yeah, but let me book through thirdparty.com so I can get the points. Let me just sit here for like 10 minutes.""

Then he goes and sits in the lobby. Why are you walking up to me to do this? Why didn't you book beforehand? Why book through the third party that always has rejected VCCs so I have to call them and get a new one before you can ever get checked in?Why walk in if you want to reserve online through a third party??",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"5:30pm, in the middle of giving guests dining recommendations I look out the window and see a wild naked man, tripping balls and running around my parking lot waving his arms as if he's being harassed by bees. Sad and funny all at once. 5:40pm, get a call from a crying guest that her son is likely not recovering from the pneumonia that landed his otherwise healthy self in the hospital a week ago, he's taken a severe turn and she can't reach her husband who had come back to the hotel to rest. Had to call and ask him to call her. Just beyond sad. Hotel life is weird.A five minute comedy and drama",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, this happened tonight.

Arrive, get audit started, no biggie.  An older (late 50's) gentleman comes up and asks if there's a lot of drug activity etc around the hotel.  Now, I've been at the hotel for 5 1/2 years, and while I can't say there's been none - we're talking like maybe twice, 3x a year we might have some problem.  I'm thinking maybe this guy is worried about keeping stuff in his truck or something.  Hopefully not asking where to get the drugs.  

However... I tell him, no, not really.  And he launches into a 5 minute tirade about the black truck he just saw next door at the gas station, and how they are following him.  And this has been going on for 3 years.  And the police have told him that they can't do anything if no one is actually confronting him about anything.  How the FBI is following him via his phone.  You get the picture.  I was really expecting hm to start yammering about Trump in some fashion.

Now, I REALLY wanted to just tell him that it sounds like he is paranoid, and that he doesn't need to call the FBI - he needs to call a psychiatrist.  Because he need to be on some kind of medicine.  

But what do you do?  You can't argue or reason with someone who is out of their mind, delusional and paranoid.

So, I pretty much just kept quiet, trying to interject a few times to get him to shut up and direct him back to his room.  Told him if I saw anyone or anything, I would inform the right people.  Which would be no one.  

Finally he went back to his room.  Wrote something in the log to warn the rest of the staff about him.  He's here for 6 days.  Hopefully he won't bother other guests.  Anyone here have any tips for dealing with the occasional delusional boomer?No point arguing with a crazy person.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello all! I've got a small tale regarding a guest who was just a bit much from the beginning and I was silly enough to think it would be a calm stay from this guest. I have only worked in the hotel industry for a few months and have yet to had someone scream/belittle me to my face. 

Me = Me, CW = Crazy Wife, CH = Crazy Husband

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a great day working the front desk, having great conversation with coworkers, and in walks Crazy Wife. She lets me know she is checking in, so I do the usual greeting while asking for ID and credit card.  

CW: Well it's already prepaid for so you don't need my credit card. It's through [fooking.com](https://fooking.com)

Me: I will still need to swipe the card for incidentals but let's take a look. Well ma'am I see here that it is not prepaid for, it was done through our Shmilton website it seems.

CW: So you don't have a room for me??? *\*immediately gets upset and emotional\**

Me: Ma'am, that is not what I'm saying. You would have put your credit card on file to hold the reservation and the total amount given to you was to let you know how much you would pay at the end of the stay. Unless the website specifically states otherwise.

CW: No I prepaid for it. You don't have my room. *\*guest then proceeds to walk away, get emotional, and begin to cry as I can see her wiping her eyes constantly\**

Thankfully CW's husband comes in, talks to her, talks to me and lets me actually explain the situation and how booking a room works. He even said ""we don't get out much"", no shit sir I couldn't tell... but I get them checked in and think that is that.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Several hours later CH comes down to let me know that  CW has cut her finger on a staple on the couch in her room. The couches in our rooms have pullout beds but there are no staples in the area that she would need to put her hand. So I speak with CH, offer bandaids, and feel the conversation out. It didn't seem urgent, he didn't ask for anyone to come and look, and overall seemed alright. 20 minutes later CH husband comes down again to ask for ointment because the cut is hurting CW. I explain that I don't have any and even if I did, I can't give it out. Which is standard with ANYWHERE you go, even employers cannot give out medications to their employees almost anywhere. So I offer what little help I can and once again he did not ask for anyone to come to the room nor did he make the situation seem like it was warranted.

I finish my shift without any other incident, have a great night, and come in early for my manager who needed to leave. Check out time rolls around and CH comes down to check out with me and we start talking.

CH: Here is a picture of the deadly staples we were dealing with! *\*shows me a picture that shows staples in a place where they are in any couch and where no hands needed to be\**

Me: Interesting, I will let engineering know to take a look later today.

CH: And here is the cut! She couldn't go swimming, she was in pain all night, and it just ruined her stay!! I think we may go to Urgent Care! *\*shows me a cut on CW's finger that is so small it barely needed a bandied\**

Me: Oh goodness! Personally I'm not sure that is need but if you believe it is need then please certainly go and follow up with us so we can assist.

CH: Well some type of compensation would also be helpful.

Me: *\*lying through my teeth\** Unfortunately I cannot authorize discounts but I can give Shmilton points as compensation.

After discussing how reward points work and the rest of his stay, CH went back to his room where I'm guessing he relayed our conversation in some strange way to CW because the whole family came down several minutes later to finalize their checkout and CW decided unleash all hell.

**Below will be various things that CW said in no particular order because the whole conversation was so ridiculous.**

CW: You ruined my stay! I cut my finger on YOUR furniture so I couldn't go swimming or enjoy my night. You don't know my medical history and you aren't a medical professional so you can't say anything. Do you want to take this outside? Because we can. This is all ridiculous, I hope you get in trouble for this!!!! You ruined my birthday. I just wanted a chance to get away from my kids and enjoy my night (she had 2 children with her the entire time so I'm not sure how this fit in...) *\*cue several more minutes of belittling and screaming at me\**

Me: Ma'am I am very sorry you feel that way. Your husband has already taken my manager's business card. Feel free to call or email him regarding the situation, have a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

After the guest left, I had my engineer confirm that yes there are staples in the couch as any other couch does but no where near where she would be putting her hand to pull out the bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, this guest blamed me for a terrible stay because she cut her finger. I've cut myself worse while shaving my legs. It's so crazy how crazy people can get over the smallest things. As expected, she left a terrible review with my name in it several times. I was emotional right after it first happened because that was the first time I had been yelled at by a guest but otherwise I am reminding myself that she was over the top and crazy.[Medium] Guest cut her finger, so I ruined her birthday.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"HI r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk \- This is my very first post on your fine subreddit.  


I work in an unnamed Australian boutique hotel that is owned by a company that owns everything.   


Around the last 5 minutes of my shift, I was checking in a few guests under a booking, where the arrival notes were listed as ""Owner of X Big Hotel(Concealed for privacy reasons)"". I had noticed that their room was quite low in the building (about half way down). Whose error this was does not bother me.  


I am a dickhead and I put the ""top tier owner level membership"" in an accessible room higher up than what they had been roomed initially. I had a complete brain snap and neglected to search for a bigger (the only bigger) room type for them. I had completely forgot that rooms ending in the same number between floors X - X were accessible.  


As I went up the elevator and hit the floor, I arrived at the door to be met with two view portholes (One at waist and one at head height) to shamefully hand over their new room key to the bigger room type I should have put them in anyway.   


It was a good laugh and learning experience to say the least.

"First a little background on my hotel. We are located in upstate NY and is a very small hotel. Also please bare with me as this is my first post here. Anyways, our hotel only has 63 rooms and its are slow season. we get at most 10-15 people a night. Can't remember when this happened, but I was in our laundry area doing laundry which were supposed to be helping with if there is any. (which is always) Ours is located behind the front desk so I can easily hear for the most part if someone is there or not. Well I heard our bell  ring so I go out and this woman is already getting huffy and puffy with me. Apparently our hot water was ice cold. I immediately apologized and went to our kitchen to grab a back up. Before coming out I tested the water and it was still hot. I even put in a cup and steam came out. I didn't bother saying anything to her but the backup that was made at the same time I brought out to her and apparently that was much much better. Really would like her definition of ice cold...The hot water is cold",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This happened about 15 minutes ago. I heard the bell rang twice, I step out to the lobby. I immediately see a chick with her daughter, and some guy glued to his phone. 

They ask for my 7-3 coworker but she had already left. I thought they were her friends that were looking for her but nope. They came by to complain about my mother who is the breakfast attendant. But these guys are not even our guests. 

She was screaming that the ""breakfast bar lady"" refused them a glass of water. She said the lady said ""no because you're not a guest"" so the chick found that very rude. This chick is screaming at the top of her lungs ""who can I speak to about that?!"" I told her trying not to laugh in her face, ""well you can try to speak to our gm, but good luck with that because since you're not a guest what can she do?"" She then asks for coffee, and then she says that the 7-3 girl they were looking for lets them have coffee. At this point I see thru her bullshit. I told her ""If she lets you have coffee then thats on her, but if any of my other staff refuse to give you any of our free beverages and pastries, you have to respect that because you're not a guest."" 

I then call my mother laughing after they all left, my mother said she was busy when they asked and witnessed them coming from the street. She also said it's not the first time they stopped by, and that she didn't ask for water, she asked for coffee. I thought this was hilarious. I wish I could've told her that ""breakfast lady"" is my Mother lmao.Non-Guest tried to accuse my mom for being rude",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"First off the following story is not mine, it comes from my sister, who wanted me to post it.

Op: My Sister, NH: New Husband, NW: New Wife

Op: I had a guest call the inn i work at On a Wednesday and ask about us hosting a small intimate event in a space at the inn that Friday. I agreed to said event and even offered them the space at no cost since it was only going to be about a half hour and only 3 people. They also booked a room for the Friday night and requested a 10am check in time in order to be ready in time for the 3pm event time.

Normal check in time is 3pm. Again being a nice person for the sake of an obvious last minute decision I tell the future bride to be I will be happy to put the room they had booked on hold for the Thursday night so they could check in early. She then asked for a late check out on Saturday since it will be their wedding weekend. unfortunately ,I have to tell her because they are checking out on a Saturday and we are fully booked I could only extend their check out until 11:30am. She says fine and hangs up. Still feeling nice and a bit of a hopeless Romantic I arranged for a bottle of wine and congratulations card to be in there room for arrival at no cost. 

Skip ahead to Friday morning, I make sure everything is perfect for the event space and that all the little personal touches to make their special day perfect are ready. 1pm comes and they have decided to not use the event space offered to them. Not a big deal. 

Skip to Saturday morning... 
NH: calls the Desk at 11:45- Hi I would like a late check out.


OP:I'm sorry sir check out is 11am and I will have to ask that your checked out by 12 sir. 


12:15: NH: finally shows up to the Desk to check out.


OP: How was your stay.


NH: Umm it did not feel as personal as our last stay. 


Me:I'm sorry sir, Will you tell me  how so.


NH: Umm it did not feel as personal.It just wasn't personal.


Me: Again I'm sorry sir can you tell me a little more details so I have something to apologize for.


NW: Mumbles something about breakfast and just walks out the door and says whatever.  


NH goes out to the car and loads the bags.Finally comes back in and says. Umm we showed up to breakfast late and there was nothing available and it's our wedding weekend. 


OP:I'm sorry to hear that sir. You said you showed up late  can you tell me what time it was you came for breakfast.


NH: Umm 10:30ish


OP:I look At this man dumbfounded and speechless and say I'm sorry sir breakfast is available until 10am Of course we would not have anything available at 10:30.


NH: But it's our wedding weekend.....

"A former employee had booked a room on leatherboundpapering.com and she didn't read the fine print about their reservations exclusively being hotel collect. She argues at check in and again with the phone operator (me) about it being prepaid. 
No dice. I am not able to alter the way third party websites do their business. Calls back a few minutes later to complain that the room reeks of chlorine. We don't have a pool but I radio housekeeping to investigate. They're taking too long so she calls again, she and her friend have been waiting forever and the smell is really overpowering. I am so sorry and I will call them to hurry them up and I offer to move her to a new room, freshly cleaned but a few floors below where she is now. Um, she'd requested a room on a high floor with a view. And she's never been treated so poorly at a hotel before, she travels all the time. Tough cookies because a request is nothing but a request, unfortunately and we're sold out. She's going to see what housekeeping can do for her. I get 10 minutes of peace. When she calls the 4th time everything is unacceptable, housekeeping wants to spray an aerosol spray for the smell and has she mentioned that the room has become dusty? Or has it always been dusty? Is housekeeping even good at doing their job? I repeat what I have offered before, I know she's expecting an upgrade for her trials but I'm not budging. Not tonight, Satan. Now she wants to leave and again whines about her poor planning and how she stays here all the time and is never treated this way. I welcome her to leave, inform her that she has to call her bank to expedite her funds being returned and even offer a bellman to help her with her luggage.

I don't even know how long it has been since I posted part 2. While this same guy has significantly cut back there have still been some issues. The first didn't happen to me but happened to 2 of my co-workers on Saturday.

They are just doing their thing and they noticed a guy sitting in a semi-hidden part of the lobby. They began to ask him questions and the guy said he was here to see some dude. However, at first this guy couldn't remember the guest's name he was here to see.

When asked the room number, he didn't know it. After about 20 minutes of him hanging around waiting for this dude they made him leave. Come to find out he had been hanging around since around 10am.

One would think that after all of this, they would finally kick out the guest. NOPE!

That said, Some people are easy to miss when its busy between 10 and 12 but I would think someone would have seen him before freaking 6pm!

Saturday night this guest came down and got one person and that was it.

Sunday night came around all was quiet. Nothing happened and I thought I was going to have a great night not having to deal with this guy and his crack heads. 3:50am Exactly, Here comes one to the door trying to get in and telling me who he is here to visit. And this guy didn't get the right room number either. However, he did tell me the right floor. I told this guy exactly what I told the guest too. He needs to contact the guest to let him in.

I wouldn't let him in because the guest was told 2  weeks ago that he has to physically come down and get his visitors. I step outside for a smoke at this time and what do i see but the guest throwing his room key down to the crackhead. The crack head came through my front door and into the elevator.

I immediately called the guest and told him that I know he was told not just by me but by at least one other person that He must physically come and get his guests and not can't drop them a key. He was told. at least 2 other times.

Hopefully with his breaking that rule, I can finally get him out of here.The Mystery of the potential crack heads (DEFINITELY A CRACK HEAD) Part 3",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"An earlier post today about a lady not understanding how OTAs work jogged my memory re the following tale, thanks for the reminder! 

TLDR at the end

We price match most third party websites where I work, and we try hard to encourage direct bookings where possible. Sometimes I just can’t find the price a potential guest is seeing and tell them they’ll have to book online after all. Not ideal but totally understandable, a saving is a saving, and many of our guests are loyal enough to be happy to pay the slightly higher rate as the whole payment comes straight to us (other Australian FDAs will know who I’m talking about when I mention the online vid made by a well known millionaire entrepreneur who asked Australians to book direct to keep the commissions in Australia). 

When a guest has elected to book a BAR, our SOP is to explain the extra flexibility this gives them ie the room is guaranteed, they can change dates and even cancel the room if necessary up to 24 hours before check in starts, and not be charged a cancellation fee. They usually have selected this rate because they aren’t 100% sure they are going to be travelling but still want something held in to give them time to plan. We also explain the clear rules of Prepaid non refundable deals to ensure no misunderstandings and have generally found taking that little extra time in the initial enquiry saves complaints later on, but of course, not all guests listen or recall what they’ve been told at the time, and others book directly on our website but apparently the rules of the rates are then open to interpretation. 

I once had a significant amount of time wasted by an unreasonable couple who had booked a BAR on our website. At check in however, they expected me to match a non refundable online rate they’d found online as they had travelled to our venue that day. The BAR was pretty flexible and they’d  had days leading up to this stay to cancel their booking and rebook while it was still outside the 24hour guaranteed check-in period if they had wanted to be clever, but by check-in time the now non refundable payment had already been processed to their credit card in full the night before as per our normal procedures. I tried to explain that the rules of the rate they’d opted for precluded changes or cancellations to a booking within 24 hours of arrival, plus you can’t just change an agreed upon price after arrival. They refused to listen to the reasons it wasn’t possible, and after I said I wouldn’t price match either, they demanded I cancel their booking and refund their payment so they could book the cheaper rate online and save ten dollars. It would have been easier just to give in, but I wanted to teach them a lesson in respecting the rules of a booking, so I complied. 

Before cancelling their booking however, I went straight into our blocking system and took that last room type off line (smaller hotel with a lot more direct control) so it would not display in any online searches once released. As it was the last room in a lower rate bracket this wasn’t going to be a major issue because I knew I’d easily sell it again later. When they went to then sit in our foyer using our free internet to go book our last Standard room on a third party web site, that room was no longer available. They came back to the desk to ask what happened and I said “oh no, someone else must have grabbed the room after you had me release it, unfortunately that’s the risk posed until the booking is secured by you, what a nuisance!” and then shook my head sadly saying I couldn’t do anything further to take that room back. 

They ended up booking a higher standard room directly with me that was more expensive than the room rate they had originally held, with a lesser discount that I happily price matched.

It was a little spiteful I know, but they were awful. I also sold the room I had taken offline less than ten minutes later to a walk-in, at the full rate too. 

TLDR guests want to change the price on check in but can’t get their way and demand the booking be cancelled and refunded so they can book online. I cancel and refund but then block the room so they can’t book it again at the cheaper rate and they are forced to pay even more the second time.Don’t want to honour a confirmed rate? Ok...",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Do yall just ever have one of those weeks? Where every single person who walks through the door is balls to the wall bonkers? For me its always in winter when the freezing temps and the lure of our very cheap dorm beds draws in the local homeless. 

For context we are a hostel that focuses on Adventure seekers as we are located in the rockies. The homeless, we shall call them locals to be polite, are not allowed to stay and we make enough money regardless I can turn them away. This week was full of them calling and trying to walk in. A nice relative even tried to slip me a 100 to let one of them stay. Lady you got a $100 why are you putting him up here? 

But anyway we shall hear the tale of the craziest of the week. What a great trophy to win. 

This dude calls me at around 6pm. Asks if we have spots. I tell him yes and that we are card only. He says great, he’ll be there in 20. He is not there in 20. I am not shocked. 

Anyway its now 8pm. Ive also dealt with people Who didnt speak any of our staffs languages and thought they booked a private room not a dorm bed for $30. Hint a $30 private room anywhere in the rockies during ski season is a serial killer plot. Also someone tried to sneak in a dog, and I saw a mouse run through our lobby. They are also locals who love wintering inside, particularly in our hole riddled 120 year old property. I love setting the traps and disposing of little corpses every morning its my favorite thing/s. And we have a guest who needs gluten free breakfast in the morning. There was more but ill stop there. 

But its 8pm! We’re small, we dont have a 24hr desk. I get to go close up and go home. Which I do! Including putting up our drunk phone signs. Which if you’re checked in have a number on them you can call for the door code if you get locked out. The sign expressly says ‘checked in guests only’ and ‘for emergencies’ Sadly it is my night with the phone. 

I get home I start making dinner its maybe 8:20 and the drunk phone rings. Oh great I think. Some dumb ass needs more towels or something. 

Nope! Its our ill be there in 20mins guy. He apparently made a reservation with me on the phone. No, i tell him you did not give me a name or card. Thats not a reservation. 

Well cant you come back and check me in? 

No, im so sorry its after 8 our staff is all home. Our staff is me. I am home. Its also 15F outside and this dude apparently cant read a sign that says emergency only. 

But i called ahead. 

Yes you did. No you cant stay here. 

It takes me approximately half a minute to lose my customer service voice. You aren’t staying here. Hes not a guest. Im 2mi away hes not in my face. I give zero fucks. I suppose if I was feeling nice I could have popped open my computer and booked him over the phone, but dinner was calling. 

So I hang up. He keeps calling. Then another guest calls. Apparently he rang the door bell alot and they let him in. Despite our giant sign on the inside of the door saying dont do that. Now this poor guest is in a really tight spot. I cant turn a guest into a bouncer. So I hop in my car and speed over. Sadly we have no live in staff at the moment, we have a two week gap between people right now. I had thankfully only had 1/2 a glass of wine. I also call the police non emergency number on my way. 

We live in a small town. Im not fond of our police force. Think Boss Hogg from Dukes of Hazards. They once harrased an international workstayer we had who was from South America. But its still a small town. I personally know the dispatcher and the police dont have better things to do. 

So i show up and kick the guy out. He was on something. Just as I get him out the door with the number for the shelter, the cops show up. He takes off running. The cops take off after him. They take him down right in front of the sherrifs car thats parked across the street where one of the deputies lives (i do like the sherrifs dept, i work with them on Search and Rescue), the deputy and his wife also come out on their porch to watch. It was a thing of beauty. Turns out he had open warrants. 

Anyway as gleeful as I was at the time. I’m now the scandal of the year (we have about one a year, otherwise literally only bike theft). So fingers crossed the town asshole who owns the bar does something real stupid real quick, he also just opened a hotel! So plenty of opportunities!

Anyway my housekeepers today were confused why a room that shouldn't have been occupied was on their boards, since they swore up and down that room was clean the pervious day and no one was checking out of it or staying over in it today. So, they do there usual knock, and try their key. Well the door flashes yellow. No problem, sometimes the battery dies and needs replacement, our maintenance sometimes marks rooms as dirty and out of order to make sure FD doesn't assign a room with a broken lock on weekends. So our laundry lady offers to head up with the skeleton key, so HK can make sure if it was a maintenance thing or if the room actually needed cleaning.

Well, apparently the room was occupied. A lady scared our poor laundry lady and very rudely told her off. So our laundry lady comes down with the HK that was going to service the room, and tell me that the room is occupied and they don't know by whom. I check my system and my buckets, no one was assigned this room for 3 days, no one should be in this room. So I decided to check myself , after no answer from the phone.

I knock and announce I was from the front desk. This woman comes to the door and violently swings open the door (pulling our flip lock), then proceeded to yell at me for disturbing her. I try to explain that we didn't have anyone assigned to that room and I needed her name to find and correct our information. She snarls her first name, then barks about the horrible service and that she had booked the whole top floor with our manager, then telling me not to bother her anymore.

Well, I go back to the front and look up her name, we don't have her first name. The HK tells me she thought she heard the woman's last name and offered to check the room that last name was attached to. Low and behold, this woman was supposed to have been moved 3 rooms down the hall, because of  a missing shower curtain in the one she was in. Last night's FD marked that this lady was moved to this other room, without actually moving anyone.

I informed my MOD what happened and explained that the room this lady was in didn't have a DND sign both times we went to check. The MOD stated that if she complains/gives a bad review it would be taken care of, because we were just doing our jobs and there wasn't a DND sign.

This is what happens if you don't make sure people are in the rooms our system says they are. It also a fire issue if we ever needed to evacuate and couldn't find ""Miss Pissy Pants"".

Update: 

Dispite me telling the MOD what happened and her telling me not to worry about anything, the GM still called and blamed me for the angry guest... I just told her to talk with both the laundry lady and HK that witnessed all of this, after giving her my version of the story (this GM for whatever reason always assumes we are lying even though it's her job to back us up in our decisions.).

"I used to work at a Lodging on a military base, and I still think about this incident from time to time. 

I was a housekeeper doing my normal cleaning, I had reached the suite area of the third floor, immediately as I opened the door to the hallway I was hit with a wall of cigarette smoke. I texted my supervisor to let her know I was about to go into a room with a smoker, but I didn’t know which room yet and I would let her know. The first room I knocked on I could tell was the smoker, the smell from OUTSIDE the room had a horrible stench. Three knocks, no answer, I enter the room (“Housekeeping! Hello?”). 

The room I had entered was a Chief Suite, meaning better than most rooms but not yet the best suite. There was literally so much smoke in the room I didn’t know how the smoke alarms weren’t going off. The curtain was halfway off of the curtain rod, after several obscenities and opening the window, I go to touch the comforter and find that the guest had put SEVERAL cigarettes out in the comforter. I go to the living room area, all of the mini liquor bottles had been filled with water, yes...even the brown liquors.....

One thing about military lodges is that the decor of the suites will reflect the culture of the location they are in. This lodge is somewhere in the Midwest, and therefore had Native American decor. Not just a random dream catcher here and there, but our GM at the time was good friends with a Native American artist who created a handmade, one of a kind spear that was hung on the wall. This artist gifted the lodge this art then RETIRED. Meaning it could not be made again. The guest (presumably after drinking all the alcohol) took the spear off of the wall and SPEARED THE LIVING ROOM CHAIR, breaking off the spear part and left it on the floor.

I immediately call my boss, MPs were called, I make a statement and they stop this dude at the gate and take him into custody. Turns out, the guest was the stepson of a General that was staying on the first floor. The General and his wife (nicest couple ever) were mortified to learn what happened and immediately agreed to pay all the damages. 

The whole time I’m thinking this idiot must be 18? 21? Nope, a 40 year old grown man. 
A nice end to the story is that the Native American artist thought the story was pretty funny and agreed to make our GM another spear, as long as we put it in a glass case.Spoiled Step-son embarrassed the General",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"So this happened about a week ago. 

We have a group in house that has been taking up all of our rooms, totally sold out.   
Not a room in the back, not a room or a shack to be sold. 

Anyway I get a call about a room and inform the nice guy that we are sold out.  
He kind of drones on and my interest peaks as soon as I realize this guy is fucking with me. 

He will be ""FG"" for Funny Guest and I will be ""Me"". 

FG: ""So anyway it might be Thursday or Friday I am coming in, depends on my push plane."" 

Me: ""I'm sorry, your what?"" 

FG: ""Push plane. You gotta push it to get it off the ground. Just put me down for coming in Friday."" 

FG: ""It's a real old plane, might not be able to push it fast enough to get there by Thursday."" 

Me: ""I'm sorry sir but we are sold out all week, not just Thursday. We do have (insert name) hotel closer by though and I know they have some rooms left for those days. Would you like their number?"" 

FG: ""Well it depends, are the walking distance to (Insert Location)?"" 

Me: ""No, neither us or them are walking distance to that location. They are closer than we are though.""

FG: ""Well do you think I could make it there by horse?"" 

\- silence for a second- 

FG: ""Also do you think they would let me bring a horse?"" 

I ended the call by saying I wasn't sure but if he needed a horse to let me know. I know a few people who own horses so I'm sure I could get him one if he needed. 

I really wanted to ask if he was being genuine or just fucking with me,

"For about three years now, I've worked at a Brampton Bin. Shitty management and gossipy coworkers made my life hell for quite awhile. But somehow, I'm feeling melancholy during my final 3-11 shift. 

The job is great and I'll really miss it. I've seen so many staff come and go during my time here. The opportunity I'm moving on for is infinitely better, but part of me feels like I was the guardian of this building having worked here for so long and been the only one in the whole place for so many shifts! Guests rave about me in their surveys but I've always gone unrecognized and unappreciated by the lazy, rude GM. I've gone through hell and back working here, but somehow it all feels worth it.

Is it weird to feel emotionally attached to a building? It feels so bittersweet to be leaving and I'm holding back tears!

I feel like my years here have been a huge accomplishment, and I'm regretting not finding a way to celebrate.

"**I don't know if I have to put a trigger warning on this or something, but my story involves someone trying to commit suicide. I won't get into any details** 

I got my first Front Desk job when I was 19 at a Superb 8 and I only stayed there for 3 months because of the Supervisor, but that's another story. I went in for my usual 3-11pm shift, but that day just went from bad to worse. 

The Supervisor that made me quit was supposed to work with myself and my co worker. I remember he came in, asked how many arrivals we had, and because it was dead he went ""okay, no point of me staying then"" and left. Okay, fine there's still two of us. By about 5pm my co worker is almost keeling over in pain, clutching his side. I told him to go to the hospital to get it checked out (I think it turned out to be his appendix and they caught it in time before anything bad happened). So he left and I'm left all alone in the building. 

It gets worse. 

The new guy that had just started a couple weeks before came in and asked for the awful Supervisor. I said he wasn't in so he left. I left the desk to go to the bathroom and when I came back the new guy was there with his uniform and said ""tell him I'm resigning"". Alright, not much else I can do. 

Now it gets bad. 

I think it was around 8-8:30pm and the phone rings. A guy asked to be transferred to a girl's room. The hotel's policy is that we put the caller on hold and call the guest to see if they want to take the call. I tell him that and he said ""don't bother she's trying to kill herself"". Um, what? He asked if I could check on her and then call him back. At this point I'm starting to freak out inside. I say okay and hang up. 

That hotel had a cordless phone to take if you were away from the desk, so I grab the phone and head upstairs. I was about to knock on her door when the phone rings. I run back downstairs and make a reservation, my hands shaking. After I'm done, I call the guest, no answer. I take the Master Keys this time and go back up. I knock, and knock and knock, no answer. I announce that I'm coming in and open the door. 

I still remember what the room looked like. There was a lamp on in the far corner by the bed, around the corner from the bathroom. She was there and I thought she was dead. I tried to shake her and checked for a pulse, but I was so scared I don't think I was doing it right. 

I ran down to the desk like a bat out of Hell and pressed the Panic Button. Those are supposed to be used if you're being robbed or something, but I was panicking so I pressed it. 

The police and ambulance showed up in 5mins and went upstairs. I was pacing in the back trying not to cry. This is when I called my Manager to say what was going on. The Night Auditor showed up at 10 because the Manager called her in and sent me home. 

I went to work the next day and no one asked if I was okay. The GM just said ""you shouldn't have gone in there"". I know that now, just call the police, but I had to see if she was okay. 

Fast forward a couple of days, I'm working the morning shift Sunday morning. The breakfast room was right across from the desk and I saw a girl eating. It looked like THAT girl. And it was. She came to check out, but then realization came into her eyes. 

She said ""it was you, wasn't it?"" I said yes and she said ""Thank you, you saved my life"". I never saw her again, but it was still the scariest experience I've ever had at work.The time I saved someone's life",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Years ago, in the 90’s I was the Front Office Supervisor at a fancy DT hotel of a well known brand that rhymes with Schmilton.

One evening I had a young Australian couple  approach me at the desk and ask to exchange some currency. I asked for their room number so I could log the transaction on the room, but they said they were not guests in the hotel. Despite being a Five Star hotel, we were just around the corner from a Youth Hostel, where they were staying.

They had been backpacking around Canada for the past 4 months and were flying home the next day, but they had run out of Canadian money. They needed a small amount of cash to eat that evening and take the airport shuttle early the next morning.

I told them currency exchange was a service we only provided to guests of the hotel. As it turned out they wanted to trade AUS dollars were not even on our supported currency list. We only did USD, Pounds Sterling and few others. The couple were very pleasant, and understanding and thanked me for my time, then moved to the other side of the lobby from the desk.

As I finished checking in another guest I glanced over and saw the couple was still there, they were standing, embraced, and I could see the lady was crying, the man was stroking her hair and consoling her. I immediately felt bad for them, and I didn’t want the last memory of their awesome trip to be going hungry.

I went out to them and asked them to wait 5 minutes for me. I went behind the desk to the Front Office where the GM’s office was. I knew he got several financially oriented newspapers each day, and in one of them I was able to find the exchange rates for AUS, USD and Canadian, and by doing some math work out the AUS to CDN rate. This was in the days before the internet!

I added 10% to ensure our fees would be covered and then I exchanged $100 for them. I think they got about $70 bucks, enough for supper, breakfast and 2 airport shuttle tickets.

The couple were extremely appreciative, the young lady hugged me and wanted to tip me out of the funds, but I politely refused. The gentleman shook my hand and thanked me repeatedly. I wished them safe travels and we parted ways. When I returned to the desk, my colleague noted that my actions were very generous, but I would probably get in trouble for it. I had a bit of a reputation for painting outside of the lines.

Our Comptroller at the time was a Chinese lady who was brought up in England, she was a C U Next Tuesday who ruled accounting with an iron fist. She and I butted heads on a number of occasions, usually when a FDA would commit a minor accounting error, she’d want them written up, and I would have to defend them.

When I cashed out at shift end I naturally didn’t balance so I wrote a note about the manual transaction and attached it to the AUS Dollars. I had my 2 days off after that, then worked the weekend so by the time I got in on Monday, I had forgotten about the incident completely.

A couple minutes into my 3 - 11 shift the FOM called me to his office and when I got there, he, HR and the Comptroller were waiting for me. Uh oh! She was fucking livid, seriously choked that I had ‘misused hotel funds’ and ‘set a bad example’ and ‘broken rules’! I asked which rules? She didn’t have an answer to that and it just set her off on another rant. I told her the couple just wanted to eat, where is the harm it that? She screamed at me “that’s not our problem!”

Out of the corner of my eye I saw the FOM signalling to stand down. He and I were good friends outside of work, we drank and rode motorcycles together, so I took the hint and shut my mouth. She wanted me fired, on the spot. The FOM asked me to go a wait in my office, a couple doors down while they discussed it.

15 anxious minutes later the FOM called me back to his office, the Comptroller was not there, just him and the HR douchebag. HR was a wanker with no backbone who never stood up for employees. They said they had talked her out of firing me and settled on a written warning and a 3 day suspension. HR DB handled the paperwork and I refused to sign the warning, I told them it was bullshit.

My FOM buddy agreed, but his hands were tied. He did, however, arrange for the suspension to coincide with both my days off and a Stat holiday, so I actually got almost a week off. He also owed me about 80 hrs for some double shifts I had pulled a few weeks earlier when we were temporarily short staffed, so I didn’t lose any pay either.

The Comptroller didn’t see me for a week and on my first day back she had a smug look on her face. But I had my own smug look because I just had an all expense paid mini vacation, paid for by her!

About a month later I was called into a Dept Head meeting, not a regular occurrence, but happened from time to time. There, in front off all the Dept Heads, including psycho Comptroller, the GM recognizes me as the National recipient for that quarter of the Schmilton’s Promise Award which comes with a plaque, a letter from Corporate and a cheque for $500! The Promise Award recognized employees who went out of their way to create memorable guest experiences in unique and innovative ways.

As I found out later, the Australian couple, upon returning home, had written a glowing letter about me to Head Office about how my act of kindness had helped them. It won me the award even though they weren’t actually guests, the only time that happened during the 3 year duration of the global promotion.

The next day I went to HR and asked the HR DB to remove the written warning, but predictably he refused. A couple of days later it appeared in my inbox, torn into quarters, my FOM buddy pulled it for me. As I was enjoying’Golden Boy’ status at the time, I figured I’d push my luck and put the scraps in the Comptroller’s inbox! Almost got written up for that one too!Forbidden Currency Exchange",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
So my raise is supposed to be on my next check and the other night auditor is getting fired but the guy they hired is making 25 cents more than me and has no experience and I'm the one training him. I've been here since September and heave to deal with all the bullshit. Does anyone have any words of encouragement? I'm 20 and my job history is spotty because car issues at the first hotel I worked at and bed bugs  at the last one.

"It's just about 1:30am here on the west coast, and while I've already had my Saturday night share of confused-looking food delivery drivers searching for an address that doesn't exist (thank you, guests who just drop location pins instead of typing in the name of the hotel you're staying at, here in the middle of this hotel district), I've also just had an unusual one!

A young man, wearing a nice shirt and tie, knocked on my locked lobby door. We lock the lobby doors when there's only one person on site, but since we're not quite a hotel and in a very quiet neighbourhood, I don't generally see much traffic after hours as it is. I opened up and asked how I could help him. He held up.....a magazine. Specifically: a Watchtower magazine! 

He told me he's heading around the neighbourhood to talk to night workers, and I thought that was a pretty clever idea. Even though I told him we couldn't accept any unauthorised material to display in our lobby and that it's just not something I'm interested in myself, he very politely wished me a friendly good night and headed off toward the hotel next door. I hope he finds some other night worker who is down to get the JW talk, otherwise I'm sure it'll be a looong night for him!

"The hotel I worked at would occasionally do cool things with the local community,   One project involved working with outreach groups to bring in special needs folks to work in housekeeping.

To be clear, there was no exploitation or anything like that.  There was a lot of effort put in by both hotel and outreach staff to make the program work. Teams of 2-3 people would work short shifts cleaning rooms with a social worker helping/supervising.  They may or may not be able to actually perform tasks depending on the individual.   But they were out in the world doing stuff.   Based upon what I observed, for the folks involved it was a positive experience.  

One reason I remember it positively was because of a girl on a room cleaning team who would periodically utter a very loud ‘Hooo!’ during her shift.  This would occur about every twenty minutes.  I don’t know exactly why she did it, but she was pretty much like clockwork.  

Think of the Stevie Nicks song White Winged Dove—‘sings a song sounds like she’s singing - ooo, ooo, ooo’.  That middle ‘ooo’ was very much the tone and timbre of that young lady’s vocalization.  It didn’t ascend or descend or sound like a question... just kind of a short, loud, somewhat musical Hooo!  

The hotel featured a large five story central atrium with wings of rooms spoking off each corner—any noise in the atrium or down one of the wings reverberated well through the entire front of the house.   Especially those loud, chronic ‘Hooo!’s.

Several times, some typical, potentially stressful front desk daytime baloney would be unfolding, only to be disrupted by a loud ‘Hooo!’ echoing through the hotel.   Passing guests would often stop in their tracks and look up and around trying to figure it out.  If they looked at me, I would usually just do the same and then shrug.  

Over time, the Hooo! became a helpful reminder that some things are silly and some things are important.  And sometimes, important things can be a little silly.

I certainly think of that person and her Hooo! every time I sing along to that song.

Go on, do it: Hooo!The girl that yelled ‘Hooo!’",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"I worked on a cruise ship for one contract, and it was the best and worst experience of my life. Traveling the world for free was incredible, but the guests are the reason I won't do it again. 

I did three weeks of training on a ship out of Miami, and then my permanent ship was in Australia (longest 15 hour flight ever).  I was told that Australians were nice like Canadians-- maybe the ones I met were just Aholes. 

My favorite story is this one: I worked at Guest Services, otherwise known as the Complaints Desk. I think we were doing a 10 day cruise in the South Pacific, and Embarkation Day is always the worst; there was always a line halfway across the lobby-- which is huge-- complaining over the tiniest things. We were a couple hours out of the port, when a couple comes to the desk. MG= Mean Guest, Me= me, obvi. 

MG: I want to get off this boat!

Me: I'm sorry sir, is everything okay?

MG: No it's not, I want to get off!

Me: We will not arrive to our first port for 2 days, sir. Is there anything I can do to help?

MG: Everything sucks and I want my money back! 

I don't really remember what he was so angry about, but he stormed off after a few minutes of yelling at me. 

But wait, it gets better. 

So on board, every department is connected with an online application that tracks guest issues, mainly complaints. We're supposed to check for new posts at the start of every shift and I see one from the Dining Room. They wrote that a man and his wife came in for dinner, were seated by the hostess but didn't like that table, so the man got up and wandered around the dining room before sitting down at another table. The Maitre'D came over to them with a dining card after they were seated and said that they could have that table for the whole cruise if they wanted, but apparently that wasn't good enough. The man then got up, stormed to the front of the Dining Room, threw the card at the hostess and left, his poor wife still sitting at the table. Of course it was MG. 

A few days go by and I read another report, this time from Security. I don't know all the details from their report, but basically MG got in a confrontation with some Security guards and ""didn't feel safe"" because they were ""surrounding him"". MG refused to leave his room until the end of the cruise and wanted all his meals from the Dining Room delivered to him (it doesn't work that way, but that part isn't crucial to the story). 

Fast forward to the last day of the cruise, they never left, and I see an email of a scanned letter that was given to our Manager. It was along the lines of ""I apologize for my behavior towards the staff, it takes me a long time to feel comfortable being away from home"", but my favorite line was ""I take most--then scratched that out--ALL of the blame for the incident with Security"". 

We all got a good laugh from the letter, and then we wondered ""did his wife force him to write it?""

"I'm working 2nd shift on a busy night so my expectation for common sense is low but... holy shit.

Lady calls me, asks for my availabilities for the night, asks if she can have the cheapest room. I tell her all I have left are basic rooms at rack rate plus tax. She thanks me and said she will be there in 30 minutes.

Lady arrives, asks what the room looks like before she takes it. I show her some photos, she approves. All of our basic rooms have been renovated very recently in pretty much the same way but there might be a few minor differences (different type of sink, tiles etc). However in photos they look a bit bigger than they are because of the angles and the wide angle lense we used to take pictures, but I figure it's the same for every hotel for advertising's sake. Still, it is exactly as advertised.

5 mins later, the lady's husband calls me. He says the room is ""nothing like the pictures"". I ask what the problems were. He says it's ""minuscule"". I sigh and explain that it's the wide angle lens we use and that it's pretty standard for hotels and even apartments and homes to use in order to make the room more appealing. He says OK and hangs up.

5 more mins later, the lady calls, her voice significantly stressful. She asks me why the suites are at a cheaper price than she paid for for a basic room. I ask her where she is seeing this and she says it's schmotels dot com. I explain that firstly, there are no more suites available tonight and I know because I checked them all in. Secondly, the price she's seeing is a non refundable rate for a basic room which is $10 less than the rack rate. She argues more and more and finally tells me she's coming to show me what she sees. Sure.

Lady comes down and shows me... (I can feel my soul leaving my body as I type this). You know how on Schmotels they show all of the general pictures of all the rooms and their ""unbeatable price"" right underneath without telling you what kind of room the price is for? Yeah. She has scrolled to, very conveniently, the picture of a suite and demands to know why it's at \[discount rate for a basic room plus tx\]. She even clicks on the reserve button to show me how she has figured out how to acquire the non existent suite for a Big Mac wrapper and a dime.

Sigh.

What is it about hotels that make people lose their minds? I just don't get it.

I ask for her phone and begin to show her. Look, ma'am, the big pictures at the top are just to show you the entire property. I scroll to the picture of a basic room, then our King Suite and say see? By your logic I can book this huge room with the top amenities for XX + tx. That's not right ain't it. She still looks confused. I then scroll down to where you can see the room type and say see? There's only the basic room listed because IT'S THE ONLY KIND I HAVE AVAILABLE TONIGHT MA'AM. NO SUITE. YOU CANNOT BOOK A ROOM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. She still looks confused.

The husband chimes in, ""We have stayed in SO MANYYYYY hotels everywhere. We know how this works."" Yeah sure you do sir.

I make a show of changing the date to one where we have all room types available and show them, see? This is what the suites go for. I don't know where you're from but you can't just expect a hotel anywhere to offer a suite at XX + tax. She says well I don't want a suite then. I want a suite NOW (ok first of all when you called you asked for the cheapest but... sure). So I perform my favourite magic trick by changing the date to today and the suite... you guess it, disappears. Lol. She makes peace with this and moves on...

... to as to why I made her pay more than what the website offers.

I begin my usual spiel of, we do not own or control OTAs, that the discounted rate is exclusive to the website only, and that its non refundable non reversible non modifiable SINCE IT'S LAST MINUTE. It's cheaper because it comes with RISKS. She asks why I can't just give it to her? Well it's because I'm not the OTA! I'm not allowed! And my reservation comes with less risks! Your logic, where is it?

I repeat that it's non refundable and she interrupts me ""Of course I don't need a refund!!!! I am already HERE!!!!""

This is not how it works. This is not how any of this works!

She demands I cancel her existing reservation and refund her so she can make another one with Schmotels.com. Since they've only been in there for 10 minutes I say sure whatever you want. I take care of a few more guests while they sit down to make a new reservation.

After 10 minutes they stand up and say, ""It's fine actually nevermind,"" and go back to their room.

All that for ten dollars plus tax.

Should've scrolled to the picture of the parking lot and told them to book that.Lady argues with me because she doesn't know how OTAs work",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

"I've been working in hotels for the past 5 years now, and one of the things that grinds my gears is when someone comes in without a reservation when we're sold out. Most people would say ""okay thanks"" and be on their way. It's the ones that are like ""okay, can you call around for me and find a room for me?"" I used to call a couple other ones to be nice, but after a while I had to tell myself that I'm not a concierge and they can do it themselves.""We're sold out, and I'm not a concierge""",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"We had a guest check in for two nights.  They booked through a familiar third party as a pre-paid reservation, so we charged the virtual card as per usual.  The guests card was taken at check in for incidentals as is also protocol.

Today, our 1st shift FDA got a call from the third party telling us that the guest would be leaving a day early because they are not happy with the cleanliness of the room.  Housekeeping did not get to their room at this point and they had a DND on their door.  

Hours later on my shift, the guest randomly shows up (way past when they supposedly checked out) and demanded a refund.  I verify the name and see it's the same one that 1st shift told me about.

I explained very calmly that we aren't the ones who charged them because they booked a pre-paid reservation through a third party, so they would have to speak with them to get a refund. (I left out that most of the time pre-paid reservations are just flat out non-refundable through the third party, but if she Karen's hard enough, she might get her money back.)

She wasn't buying it.  Still wants a refund.  I pull up her folio.  

""Did you use an AX card ending in XXXX?""

""No! I gave the woman a Visa!""

""Well on my side, I can only see us charging an AX which is usually what popular third party uses as a virtual card for us to charge.  I see your Visa information is here, but there is no charge associated with it.""

""You need to refund my money, the room was horrible!""

I explain again, that we didn't charge her card, so there isn't even a way for me to refund her anything.  Plus what she was charged by the third party is different than what we charged the virtual card for.  I gave her my manager's card and said when they will be in on Monday if there are any further questions for us, but her best option is to take this up with the third party for a possible refund.

She finally leaves and exclaims ""How Rude!"" as she walks out the door.

"A few years ago when I started something like 8 out of 10 people would come back to the front desk asking for another room or Demanding a full refund. Things like the TV won't turn on, the AC wasn't working, a window was left open or that housekeeping hadn't even cleaned the room. The housekeepers were not very conscientious about how they left the rooms and no one cared to update conditions in the system. It was so frustrating because Sometimes it was all my fault and as one guest behaving badly so eloquently put it I would have to explain to the GM why I was so stupid. 
So after a week of this happening with seemingly every other guest, I asked... who checks the rooms before guests arrive to make sure they are good?

No one. 

That was just how it was, let housekeeping sit on thier phones, leave shit in the toilets and food in the fridges. So I just took it upon myself to check, to make sure the rooms were proper before arrivals. I'd turn on a light, set the ac to a cool temp and make sure the tv was in fact plugged in. The front desk employee that had been there for a couple years was baffled. What are you doing? So I explained I would rather just make sure the rooms are in a condition I would want to check into if I was spending $250 a night... Then I took photos of before and after of how the in room amenities should be. Coffee and teas neat looking in the holders, not just shoved in upside down and backwards. The placards standing up and not face down and backwards. The bath accessories neatly in a row and not (you guessed it - knocked over and backwards... The staff did not like that I did this but the owner did, and the 8 out of ten people asking for another room hoping for a better situation dropped to Zero. No more people demanding a refund. No more people getting upset at me for the room condition. And thats how I put it to my co workers, they were not the ones getting yelled at and insulted, and when people check into a room they expect certain things like, an empty fridge, or say a clean toilet... 

Also so I didn't come off like a total jerk, I would help when I could. Taking rubish out for them, getting supplies and bedding from the basement, anything I could to help out. I am not the boss and it's not my place to tell anyone else what to do but I do need clean proper rooms for people to check into in order for me to do my job. Well the GM didn't like my initiative either. I was wasting electricity by having ac heat lights on. Would rather have people walk into a dark disgustingly hot, possibly trashed room that hadn't even been touched by a maid. 

I was told ""you are the front desk your job is to just stand there and look pretty. Don't leave the desk to check rooms."" 

So i did, till the complaints started coming up again... brought it back up with the owner, and the GM said she would be checking the rooms. That happened for a few days. So I kept it up myself. Well now it's winter and I've been turning on the heat. And today when I got to work I asked if the rooms rented were good. 
The gm said yeah why aren't they marked clean in the system? 

Well I was going to turn on a light and the heat and make sure the tvs are plugged in.

Gm: Stop doing that. We are on a budget and if someone doesnt check in the light gets left on and the heat is left on for weeks and nobody knows. The people will be fine. They know where the light switch is they can figure out how to turn on the heat.

Me: so even when the rooms are freezing cold.

Gm: yes! Stop doing that. It doesn't take that long for a room to heat up. Unless you want to be responsible for turning it off when they don't check in. Just leave it. They'll  be fine. 

Five minutes later a room comped by the owner checks in. And two minutes later they call down to the front desk. 

Comp room: it is very cold in our room. How do you get the heater to work?

The Gm didn't say anything.

"General Manager at an independent. Couple comes in last night, employee decides even though they can't put down the whole cash deposit they can stay.  (Big no-no.) They're right on the edge of being someone you just want to turn away. Anyway, next morning.

Guy comes down and asks for his deposit back. I happen to be in my office right next to the desk so I offer to go check the room. Open door, room reeks of cigarettes, some tobacco and ash on the bathroom countertop. Inform guest they won't be receiving their deposit. Him and his girlfriend who ""worked in a hotel for 3 years"" (they all seem to have done that) flip out and ask for a manager. That's me. Ask them to leave. Nope. They won't take no for an answer. Tell them I'm calling a cop, I dont have time for this shit. They balk, go outside to presumably discuss whether either of them has an active warrant. Come back in demanding a cop comes. Call PD non-emergency. 

Problem guests spend next 45 minutes discussing how impossible it would be that they a. Smoked and b. That the entire hallway wouldn't smell of it. I'm a scumbag, just wanna pocket their last 64 bucks, etc etc. This isn't how hotels work. (Again we're independent, it works however I say it does) 

I wanted to say that if she was so experienced in the hotel game it's ironic that she's the one telling me that I'm a bad GM and also throwing a shit fit over 64 bucks because they don't have any money at all now, that's their last money. 

Anyway, come comes tells them they can hire a lawyer and take me to claims court, it's a civil matter. Trespass paperwork done. Whatever whatever.

It just blows my mind that people consistently pull this shit. Why are you in a hotel if you only have 150 bucks to your name. Slept outside plenty in the army, maybe y'all should buy some sleeping bags instead of a hotel room. Or just y'know, follow the one rule you had to to get your deposit back. It's so tiresome. It's the same person, every single time, no matter who they are or where they're from. I turn away so much business just because it's not worth having scumbags in, doing hoodrat shit and freaking out other guests, giving us a bad reputation. It's hard to feel bad for anyone anymore. Also, I'm 25, the lady was 35. Why do I have to be the grownup. People suck. I wish they would just follow the rules and act normal. It puts stress on me, and my staff.

"Before I begin I want to point out that 1) No one was hurt in the event listed below and 2) There is an ongoing investigation into the matter. Now onto the story.

TL;DR A guest who was already checked out decided to stay in room then threaten employees with a gun when told to leave

My shift the other day started off like any other: quiet with the occasional drunk trying to start shit and failing. Nothing unusual where I live. Then, just before my shift was over, the (likely) girlfriend of one of our guests says she wants to check out. No problem. As long as they are registered to the room, they can get the deposit back. She takes her money and leaves (or I thought she left). About 20 minutes later, after I got done delivering a message to another room, I hear a commotion coming out of the room I had thought checked out 20 minutes prior.

I go and inform my coworker and boss and my coworker goes with me to the room. When we enter we see the two now checked-out guests still in the room. The guy looks wigged out on drugs (crack maybe?) and has a vest like harness on with a gun holstered in it. For reference we will call the guy Jim and my coworker Chrissy. Jim's girlfriend said some things but I don't remember since she wasn't talking loud enough for me to clearly hear her. The following fuckery insues:

Me: What are you guys still doing here? You're checked out you need to.. \*Jim cuts me off\*

Jim: We will leave when we are damn well ready to.

Me: Sir you can't check out and then comeback in. This isn't your room anymore.

Jim: This is MY goddamn room and you need to get the fuck out of here.

Chrissy: Sir you need to leave now. You're already checked out. You cannot be in here.

Jim: Shut the fuck up. \*slaps his chest three times\* I'm packing.

I know I'm not that niave. That was a threat if I've ever heard one.

Me: Sir I'm going to have to ask you to \*Jim cuts me off again\*

Jim (now in my face so close we could be kissing): What the fuck you gonna do? Do something. DO SOMETHING!

Now this was probably not the smartest thing I ever did, but it was all out of instinct and reaction and not trying to piss him off more. I shoved him back to get him and his smelly ass breath off of me.

He regains his balance and is now as angry as a thousand wild Karens. He is now screaming.

Jim: GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM! NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT!

At this point it's worth noting that I was completely unarmed. I normally carry a taser on me as a just in case, but I left it in the office since if people are still in a room after checkout they will leave if a bit mad about it. But this time I was completely unarmed. He now feels it is necessary to pull out the gun in his vest holster and point it right at my forehead, still screaming at me to get the fuck out. At this point, Chrissy orders me to go to the office and call 911. He's screaming how he is gonna wait for the cops and have me arrested for assault. Chrissy comes back to the office with Jim in hot pursuit. He then starts yelling at my boss who is just standing there confused as to what just happened.

I get on the phone with police and as I'm talking to them, he and his girlfriend get into his car and begin to drive off. They turned off the side road where our motel is located just before the cops showed up. He is still hasn't been caught yet but the police have all the information he needs on him so it's just a matter of time until he is caught.

"I've been patiently awaiting my account being old enough for this sub so here's a mild one to start off since it's my most recent.

So I have a pretty regular guest that I just cannot stand. He is the manifestation of all of my pet peeves when dealing with guests. He has a whiny, monotone voice that always sounds like he wants you to feel bad for him. He never stops talking and he never listens. Every single encounter goes exactly the same way.

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

Annoying Guest: Oh hi I'm \[AG\] I stay here all the time and I don't have a reservation but I need a room for tonight and I want it at the same super low super special rate I usually get, \[GM\] is a real good friend of mine and he always gives me a really good rate and I want an upgrade to a bigger bed so my wife and I can fit in it but I don't want to pay any extra for it.

Me: Yeah sure ok I can't really-

AG: Oh and I've been on the road for a couple of weeks now and since I've been on the road I'm too tired to make it back home and I just got out of the hospital yesterday and I need some extra pillows so that I can sleep and since I just got out of the hospital I need a late check out and \[GM\] knows me real well and he always lets me get a late check out and it's never a problem.

Me: Ok sir I need you to-

AG: Oh yeah and me and \[GM\] go way back and we're real good friends and he always treats me well and I always get extra special service and a really good rate and that's why I always come back here because I know he'll give me an extra special deal and go out of his way to help me out with whatever I want .

Me: Uh huh ... here's your keys

Now, the first time I heard his spiel it didn't bother me too much. Sure it was a little annoying the way he just droned on in his whiny voice without even paying attention to what I was saying, but I thought ""Well he seems alright, and he did just get out of the hospital so I feel bad for him, and he is \[GM\]'s friend.""

Turns out my GM hates this guy. Can't stand him. Gets real upset that he just never stops talking and always expects special treatment for a dirt cheap rate regardless of how inconvenient (or straight up impossible) it is. GM had him on the ""Do Not Rent"" list for a while, but because he hadn't really done anything (and he's an Extra Shiny Snowflake Member) corporate said we can't do that. So then GM just started telling him that we were sold out. This didn't work either because AG would just use his Extra Shiny Snowflake points to book a free room online.

After finding all this out I was far less sympathetic to THE EXACT SAME STORY every time. Like, maybe he actually is in the hospital every other week, but also if he is that should probably be a hint to stop spending weeks at a time on the road?

Anyway, this guy is annoying but he's never given us a real reason to DNR him ... until now.

AG comes in and the same old song and dance plays out. Then, he says not to charge his card until the next day because there's no money in the account until 11:00AM when he's expecting a transfer.

Immediately, every alarm I've acquired in my time at the front desk starts going off at once. I know I should just tell him to take a hike, but I have a better idea. Without saying anything I check him in like it won't be a problem, knowing full well that it will be.

The next morning he leaves without stopping by the desk and, what a surprise, his card still won't authorize. The morning FDA tried it over and over to no avail. I finally come in for my afternoon shift and the card still won't even authorize for a single cent. 

All according to plan. 

I call the number he has on file and it goes straight to voicemail. The voicemail message says to call him back at another number but that number isn't even real. I find another number attached to his Snowflake membership and it's disconnected. I can't even email him because all his email addresses are some variation of obvious\_throwaway@\[hotelchain\].com which exist solely to sign up for Snowflake points. 

Perfect. 

Having no other option, I call corporate. Unfortunately, he doesn't owe us enough money to have his Snowflake status revoked but he's officially DNR at my property and I get to rest easy knowing that I'll never have to deal with him again.Annoying guest finally gives me a reason to DNR him",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have been a night shift worker for 5 years now. It started with getting to my mind, making me feel lonely, not being part of all the activities because I have to work, not being part of all the general group that works in the day and not being able to talk to a lot of guests. Now I have started to feel the effects on my body. My lungs are not working optimal(I don't smoke) , and I am generally not sleeping well anymore, sometimes 4 hours before a shift.

I have asked to have a few less night shifts, and a few more day shifts, to be more a part of the staff, and to talk to more guests. They basically didn't do anything about it, even though I showed them what I could do by making a system in the store room and routines for the kitchen staff. I also wrote in my reports about the few small but good experiences the guests had of me since we have a question in the report for just that.

I started becoming so tired that my posture became very slanted and i started to feel a pain in my arm, which according to my physical therapist, came from my neck. I had a sick leave for a week, and then a few weeks later, the pain got worse, I powered through, but then I just said that I couldnt come in to work for a few days. Then, I got a mail from the GM.
 It basically read: 
""I really hope you're not going to go on sick leave again. It's very hard for other people to work your night shifts. Your job is not that tough anyway, so you can just keep your arm calm during your shifts."" 

And since then they decided to hire extra people to work if either of us 2 working night got sick. Allright, I thought, now they got 2 extra people who could probably take some of my shifts so I could take some day shifts. Nope. Some day shifts got available in the beginning of the fall, and I asked if I could work them and get a few less nights but they told me they couldn't do that. They didn't give me a reason. 

I now have some trouble with my lungs, undiagnosed. My arm has gotten better, but not perfect. And now they put up a new question in the night shift report that asked how we were doing on our shift. I wrote that I didn't do well. After a few days my boss asked why. I told him that I couldn't sleep well, that the improvements I did didn't matter to people, and that I still felt lonely. He basically said:
""yeah, same.""
A bit over a month later, I got so tired that I fell asleep while walking. Then the GM sent me a mail and said that it wasn't cheerful enough to write that i didn't have a good shift. She also sat me down in the morning and told me to think more positive. Keep in mind that I have arranged parties and activities for the employees, no one else has done that. And countless other stuff that I have changed for the better at the hotel, tangible things that I can point to. I could do a lot more but when I ask the management for help they don't do anything and wait for me to do it. 

But sure, I am the bad guy. 

Good thing that I got ""receipts"" between me and the GM and other management at the hotel of how they have treated me. But now I am stuck in a job that I have to do until my health gives in or go down in pay because I have to go for another job that has less hours and pays less. 

Sorry for the long posts, even though I tried to keep it to the essentials.

Update: just found out I might have a good reason to report them to the authorities for this.I am barely holding it together at night shifts, the GM thinks that it's not very cheerful of me to say that I'm not doing good.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Thank you guys for sharing important information like this, but I don't need any more comments sharing the same info. I've already brought it up to my manager. Have a lovely day 💕***

Hi, hello. 

I'm mostly a Reddit lurker but working the front desk in a hotel is bound to leave you with some stories to tell. 

Sometime last year I had this lady come to check in - early no less, which meant I was already just a little peeved with her. Check-in is at 3pm and it's at 3pm for a REASON, but we are rather lax with that rule. If the room's ready we'll generally check the guest in regardless of how early they are. If it were up to me we'd enforce the rule more often than not, since advertising to anyone who asks that we allow early check-ins at no charge makes guests come to expect it every time they visit (we've had people at the desk wanting to check in as early as 7am and get mad that we didn't have their room ready on a Saturday morning in the middle of a solidly booked weekend) but I digress. 

So this woman is here to check in, and oh by the way she brought a dog. Cool, we're pet friendly, I just need her to read our pet policy and sign the agreement (the usual stuff, keep the animals off the furniture, have them crated if left in the room alone, clean up after them outside, etc) and it's all fine and dandy until I bring up the pet cleaning fee, which is $35. 

She. Throws. A. Fit. 

""THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS TO HAVE MY 12 POUND DOG IN THE ROOM?! THAT IS RIDICULOUS! IT SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS ON (online booking site)!""

Third party reservations tend to be obnoxious a good portion of the time for a variety of reasons, including spam bookings with invalid credit cards that end up being no-shows that we can't charge, and another reason that I'll explain in a minute. 

Firstly, our listings on third party booking sites actually do clearly state that we are pet friendly and there will be a fee applied. Of course the exception to that rule would be a registered service animal - by law - and we have to be shown their papers at check-in. 

She asks me to waive the fee. So I apologize for the miscommunication and explain to her our policy, tell her I can take cash or add it to the bill being charged to her card. 

She thinks for a minute. 

""Well, he's an emotional support animal!""

I believe this exactly 0%, but I play along and ask to see the papers anyway. She says she doesn't have the papers on her. I smile and explain our policy to her again, this time highlighting what I mentioned above, that guests bringing in service animals will not be charged the fee, but ONLY if we are shown papers at check-in. 

Finally, she backs down on that, but is not happy about it. I add the $35 to her bill. She goes to her room with her dog, and I have hope for only about a half hour that I won't have to deal with her anymore. She comes back out and starts looking at our for-sale items. We have a small ""gift shop"" located directly next to the front desk which is really just a little nook with some glass shelves stacked with knick knacks, canvas paintings, and various decor. The lobby is filled with such decor, some of which is price tagged. Guests usually get a kick out of going around to look at everything and seeing that much of what is displayed is also for sale even if they don't buy anything. This lady looks at everything that's for sale, picks stuff up and says ""that's cute!"" and then looks at the price tag, turns to me, and says, ""this is *not* worth (insert $$ here)."" To be fair, some of the stuff is overpriced, but most of it is pretty on par with what you'd spend on the same stuff at any other primitive-style shop. This is the least  irritating thing she did during her stay, but I just thought it was kind of rude. 

Anyway, it rolls around to a day or two later (can't remember how long she stayed) but I was also on shift when this woman came to check out. Where I work, the whole charging process goes like this; when guests reserve we take the card information to hold the room (and be able to charge them if they no-show), we hold the funds at check-in, and then we charge them when they check out. So I go through my usual check-out spiel, which is mostly just asking how their stay was, confirming that the card on file is the one they want to pay with (guests often decide to split payment between two cards or pay half in cash and don't say so at check-in) and ask them if they want a receipt. So I'm like ""and this is going on the card you gave me at check-in, correct?"" 

And she stops me and asks what the total is going to be. She acts surprised (even though part of my check-in speech is pointing out the total for their stay including tax on the reg card that they sign before I give them their keys, and it was the same total I'd shown her before with the $35 added like I told her it would be) and says she should have gotten a discount because she booked through a third party. Which... Technically she did, but only of a few dollars. 

So, I tell her that she did, in fact, receive a small discount. She still doesn't like it, demands a bigger discount. Now we come back around to one of the other reasons why third party reservations are obnoxious. We can't alter the rates for third party reservations, since when reservations are made through their sites, they are entitled to a percentage of the payment we receive from that guest. Basically, if we lower the rate for a guest who booked through a site like that, we lose money. We have plenty of guests ask about a senior discount and stuff like that at check-in or check-out when they booked through a third party, but most of the time when we explain that we can't alter their rate they accept it and move on. 

Not this lady. 

""Well this rate is ridiculous and -"" blah, blah, blah. Lady, you knew the rate when you booked. And even if you didn't, I reiterated it for you at check-in. Not only am I not SUPPOSED to change the rate for reservations like these, I literally CAN'T change them in the computer system. I tell her this. She argues with me for five minutes, all the while I just keep repeating the policy back to her. She pulls the ""my husband was in the military so I should get the government rate."" Which, again... Not how it works. I have to see government ID to give out the government rate. Which she obviously doesn't have. She argues with me for five MORE minutes.   Eventually one of my coworkers, who mostly works breakfast but sometimes works shifts at the desk, comes out and tells me to just give the woman a 10% discount and refund her in cash, which I am absolutely LOATHE to do and wouldn't have done if the guest hadn't already heard her say it. So I refund her cash and send her on her way, smug and stealing from us.  

And then after the last of my departures for the day have checked out I go to open the doors to dirty rooms so I can take out the trash and strip the beds for housekeeping... And this woman has made SUCH a mess. Bags taken out of the garbage cans, a full can of soda spilled in one of them along with some unidentifiable sludge, popcorn ground into the carpet, stained sheets. 

Looking back on it, I wish I'd charged her a cleaning fee. I was still new at the time and was nervous to do things like that, and honestly a big part of me just didn't want to hear from her again, and we certainly would have if we charged her card again. Instead I passed the info along to my manager, who I don't believe charged her either since the room had already been cleaned and she's not fond of charging people herself. These days my spine is shinier, and should she ever return she's got another thing coming.(long) Karen rant",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I have been in this industry for a long time. Close to 10 years now. I started as an FDA and moved my way up through 3 different hotels. I have seen things, heard things, and smelled things I have never imagined possible. And I dont know why, but people seem to lose all common sense when they stay in a hotel. 

Cut to today. I woke up already feeling like this was going to be a suck ass day at work. And it seems I was right. 

My head of housekeeping comes down from the 3rd floor, saying it smells like literal death. Come to find out its someone in a room in the middle of the hall.....

On mobile so sorry for formatting

This might not be the most exciting story but I think it’s a fun one.

I work at a Luxury hotel in Southern California that sees a lot of large groups. 

I am the group reservations coordinator and I just happen to stumble upon a problem guest.

The back story:

About a year ago we had a large group take up about 80% of the hotel. At this time I was at the front desk and they were not an easy group. Lots of random requests and entitled people. The group came and went and in my mind it was over, However, they had one attendee who was also responsible for paying the hotel. At the end of their program they owed the hotel about $15k. Our accounting team did everything they could to get them to pay. They worked out a payment plan but eventually they stopped responding to out emails  and calls. The remaining balance was about $8k. The Hotel pretty much wrote it off and 86’d the group.

Fast forward to this past Monday. I get an email from an admin of someone attending a conference from a separate group at the hotel next month. This program contracted their rooms to be non-refundable once their attendees made the reservation. So we have gotten a few people who have had to “cancel” and are allowing other people to take over the reservation,

The admin says that they want to provide a new credit card for a reservation so that a new attendee can take over a reservation. Now, we have to send a CC authorization for this over email. The admin is reluctant and says he would rather just do it over the phone. I let him know we have to use the authorization form and I don’t hear from him for about a week, 

I finally get an email that says he filled out the authorization and asks for confirmation. I call the accounting team to make sure it’s ok and the lady has a long pause, she asks me how this person made reservation, I let her know it was a name change and they were changing the payment method. She informs me of how he ghosted us and says she has to talk to the accounting director.

We just got a new GM and turns out this guest also did not pay his last property for $50k (that’s not a typo). So to wrap this up, out DOS is trying to get payment from this guy or we are going to inform the group that this particular guest is not welcome on property.A fun story about a guest who refused to pay us",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Yesterday morning at about 3AM, I'm away from the front desk and in the breakfast area making fresh pots of coffee. About 15 minutes go by when a guest comes flying around the corner. He says that he was trying to call someone at the front desk for water leaking from the ceiling in their room on the 3rd floor.

We both go up to the room and notice that water is leaking from the ceiling in the bathroom, the main room, and the closet. First thought was ""Possibly a fire sprinkler error"" so no big deal. I move them down the hall into a new room. As I'm making the guests new card keys, a phone call from the 2nd floor calls and reports the same thing. Water leaking from the ceiling. Now this is big issue.

After moving the guests from the 3rd floor, I go to the 2nd floor room and witness the same exact thing. Water leaking from the same spots like the previous room. *Audible groan* After moving the 2nd floor guest to a new room, I decide to check to see if the 4th floor was affected.

Low and behold, the carpet in front of a room on the 4th floor is SOAKED. As inch to the door, I can hear the shower in the room running. Now my worst instinct was ""Oh fuck, someone's dead in there.."" But I have no choice. I go in, there's one guy passed out on a bed, the carpet up to the first bed is drenched, and the bathroom door is locked. I manage to unlock it and open it up.

A gentleman managed to fall on the shower floor with his body covering the drain. Legit thought he was dead. I yell at this man and suddenly, he wakes up! Barely able to speak, he gets up and noticed what has happened. No injuries, no cuts, no blood, no nothing. The man got in the shower drunk as hell and passed out right there on the shower floor. 

Manager arrives, I explain the situation, and we get the guests from the 4th floor into a new room. I didn't get to leave the hotel until 7AM.

I'm sure that gentleman will remember this. As well as his bank after the $750 Damage Fee for all 3 rooms.

Backstory: The first hotel I worked at was located on the beach, as I had worked in the hotel industry for over 10 years, I have many entitled people encounters. Thankfully I have left the industry and enjoy not dealing with travelers who think they can demand everything and pay nothing for it, they treat you like dirt while being paid close to minimum wage. This story happened in the early 90’s so way before internet bookings and advanced computer systems. Our computer terminals took 5 minutes for the computer to get you logged in. This is not a joke it took that long and once you logged in you never logged out, that station was yours for the duration of your shift. Our hotel computer system was so bad, we had to pre-block all rooms for the incoming guest to know how many rooms we truly had leftover.

Story:

Our hotel was sold out one night and there were several people trying to see if they could get their reservations extended for another night. JG comes down and says ""I wanted to extend his stay one more night"". I explain ""We are currently sold out, but we can put him on a waiting list for any rooms that might open"". JG said, “Well what if I choose not to leave are you going to kick me out”. I replied, “No but if you stay your rate tonight will be this much.” It was about three times what he was currently paying. He smiled and said, “No I get government rate because I am a government employee”. I said with a smile “While you are a government employee, we do not have to offer government rate as you didn’t have a reservation for tonight”. He did not like this answer and said, “You cannot do that”. My reply “Sir do you think we will extend your government rate if we have to put someone up in another location while you pay 1/3 of the price it would cost us to put another person up because you would not leave? The hotel management will never allow that to happen as we would definitely lose money.” He was shocked I said that too him and said, “Fine put me on your list”. I turn around and see my Boss standing behind me with an aggravated look on his face. I tell him “Sorry I know I was full of crap and I just made that up on the spot.” My boss replied with an evil grin “No you didn’t, that is exactly what we are doing and now that you warned him, I can do exactly that and thank you.” The guest decided to leave and get a room somewhere elseJerk guest thinks he will extend his stay when we are sold out.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm going to preface that while this one involves an angry guest, his anger was completely justifiable, I harbor no ill will toward said guest.

This woman who works the desk before I get in on the other hand....

So, this woman has worked here for some time now, and she is always making mistakes, some big, some small, but all things she should know better by now. She has messed up so many reservations I've had to fix on my audit shift that I've stopped counting. I barely even complain about her anymore.

Tonight, though, one of her mistakes got me fuming.

Enter angry guest - he was never checked into our system, for some reason unknown. It's not that hard a process, seriously it's two buttons on the computer. She has done this 1000+ times at this point. She knows if a reg card is signed, the buttons need to be pressed.

So, I check him in before audit and leave a very polite note stating the issue, that it is our fault, and we'd like to resolve it.

5:00 am, he's in my lobby, absolutely IRATE that I'm asking for his information, *again*. He refuses to provide it, yells at me some more, tells me to talk to his group leader, yells some more and then stomps off to his room. Completely understandable to me, I would be pretty pissed if I were in his shoes, and while nothing excuses the things he said to me I am still way more angry at the idiot who neglected to check the guest in.

So please folks.... If someone signs the reg card just check them into the system. Save your Night Auditor's sanity.How can you work here as long as you have and not know how to check in a guest...?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Our events coordinator has apparently been in contact with an agency for a while to book a block of rooms for a posse of models. They hemmed and hawed and it wasn't until today that they booked with us. At two pm. 

A little background about my hotel. We're a teensy boutique hotel that's primarily a luxury resort for couples. Very low occupancy, no double rooms. 

We get the paperwork together for all the check ins, and it's not until we have the first model check in that things start to get interesting. 

Turns out, it's a bunch of child models and their families. Their complaints are as follows. 

1. No double rooms or rollaways, which sucks for all the people that brought the whole nuclear fam. A few of them wound up having to book second rooms with their own money which, as one angry mom put it ""defeats the purpose of getting paid"". (I totally get it, and I have no idea why anyone would book children and their families into our hotel, which clearly has room specs on the website. 
2. The restaurant closes early, at 9pm, and the families are pissed because they've driven about six hours to get up here. 
3. Their shoot is in the very early hours of the morning, before the restaurant opens up for brunch, and even though I told I'd be letting Night Audit know to set up a continental breakfast earlier than normal, but there was still complaints that there aren't coffee makers in the rooms themselves.
4. Not being grouped all next door to each other. A lot of the kids are pals, so they were all hoping to be roomed together, but because of the late booking/ alternating room size in our floor plan, the kids all wound up pretty spread out. How very sad. 
5. The pool has fixed hours. Our pool heater shuts off at 8 to respect the rooms close to the pool, and the family was under the impression that the kids would be able to swim to get rid of ""nerves"". 

Add this all up with the pleasure of the group arriving at the same time, crowding into my little bitty 20 square feet lobby, and it's been wicked hectic. Not to mention the noise complaints coming in from the regular guests staying with us.

"A third party who shall not be named but we all know by name has struck again, kids.   


For those who live in the Big Star State down south like I do, the Stock Show and Rodeo is currently happening downtown. (For my fellow FDAs there, I hope your nights are going smoothly!) As a result, adding in some competitions going on, every hotel in the area is sold out.   


This is frustrating a lot of people attempting to do walk-ins but I can only shrug and offer suggestions. Unfortunately, this does not stop people from booking through third-parties.   


Just now I had a third-party, pre-paid fax come through with information that someone had booked here for the evening. For a room that does not exist and for a hotel that's been sold out since this morning.   


Resisting the urge to tear the fax to pieces, I instead start to get on the phone with them only for this poor woman to come in. Being the bear of bad news, I have to tell her that ""they"" had sold her a room that does not exist.   


Her face both fell and got frustrated, stating that this is the second hotel they've been to before ushering her family back to the car.

"Fairly short one. I just needed to vent.

I've just started month 2 doing the front desk for a small building of self-contained apartments of 99% short stays, because we're near the iconic bridge and sails.   
This is the Australia day long weekend, also coinciding with the Lunar New Year in the CBD, and we're full nearly to the gills. 

We're expecting a party of two to arrive for a studio apartment today. 

They brought a party of 5. No problem, we can just charge them for the extra headcount right?

Wrong.

On further investigation, this studio was mistakenly listed as 1bdr, 6 person capacity. There are only enough beds for 3 people in here. 

Luckily, they're only staying for one night, so I shifted them over to a vacant 2bdr apartment in the same building and *and they put up no fuss about the difference in room price*. I thought that was just perfect, fixed the listed room capacity, but then got a call from the manager who'd been notified of this change via the PMS.  
I don't have a direct translation, but the gist of it was that I should have left them there because they'd booked so far in advance and now we can't sell that more expensive room on such a busy weekend.

"So I work at (a boutique in) a relatively small 5-star, 5-diamond in one of the largest cities in the US which is also a huge tourism city, and we're located in one of the richest areas of the city. Furthermore, we're also currently hosting a professional sports tournament this weekend. As you can imagine, it's pretty chaotic here right now, and a lot of money is being spent everywhere you look.

Now, some (read: many) people don't want to spend what we're charging on just their room, so luckily for them there's a popular chain literally right next to us. It's about a thirty second walk from one of our side doors to one of theirs, and even with the frugal masses staying next door, we're still at 99% occupancy.

So about an hour and a half ago, I have this couple come into my shop and ask if we do room charges. I confirm, they're delighted, and they bring up a little trinket. I ring it up, ask for their room number, and everything gets messy.

Man: We're in 5000-something.

Me: I'm sorry, sir. Do you mean 500-something? Our room numbers are only three digits, and 500 is the 5th floor.

Man: We are on the 5th floor, but it's definitely 5000 'cause we're room number 100-something.

Me: Sir, we barely have 100-something rooms in total let alone just on the 5th floor. Are you perhaps staying in the Chain next door?

Man: Yes. I didn't realize that had to be specified.

Me: I see. I apologize for the misunderstanding.

Man: Okay, so Chain room number 5000-something then.

Me: Pardon me, sir?

Man: Chain room number 5000-something. It should be under Name.

Me: I'm sorry, sir, but I can't post a charge to the Chain. It's a separate hotel.

Man: I'm aware that it's a separate hotel. There's no way we were gonna pay over $2500 to spend the tournament weekend here.

Me: I understand, sir, but we can't post a charge to rooms other than our own.

Man: This is ridiculous. You're literally right next door. Can't you just call them and ask them to charge it over there?

Me: I'm sorry, but no, I can't, sir. If I did, you would be paying them rather than paying us. Besides, we're unaffiliated with them, so we have absolutely no access to their systems. It's not that I don't want to charge your room, it's that I can't.

Cue him calling me stupid, our system stupid, the hotel stupid, ranting that it's so much better that they stayed at Chain instead of us, and his wife ushering him out of the store. As she wrangled him out of my shop, she looked back at me and said, ""I'm so sorry. I'll be back later with my wallet.""

*TLDR at the bottom

Let’s start this story off by noting that I was on vacation for a few days when these events transpired, and unlike the owners, I do not have access to the camera feed remotely, nor do I want access to the camera feed remotely. This hotel takes up enough of my time as it is; I don’t need to watch ants on a screen while I’m home or on vacation or anywhere else for that matter. 

Would me being present at the hotel have stopped these things from occurring? Possibly. I can’t 100% say that I would have noticed something was off, but it’s likely. I try to pay attention to things and sometimes check the nightly security footage on fast forward after I’ve rewound it, but alas, I was not around and most of this took place during the night shift, while the warm body of our newly-hired night auditor watched Netflix on her phone.

Do I wish I could fire this inattentive idiot, or at least reprimand her? Oh, of course. But the owners have recently decided that “we can’t say anything to the night auditors anymore, because then they’ll quit”, and the owners don’t want to have to do the work themselves until they find another warm body to sit behind the desk all night like a useless sack of potatoes.  So sadly, even as the GM, I don’t have much say in the matter when it comes to the owners’ decisions. I have already voiced my opinion on the matter to no avail. 

So, with all the background out of the way explaining why things are the way they are, let’s begin...

A few weeks ago, the owners hired a new day-shift guy for the front desk. He turned out to be a typical new hire; working for a week or so then not showing back up. A no call/no show results in termination of one’s employment, and they can come collect their paycheck when it’s ready. No worries, it’s a pretty common occurrence, as our hotel has a ridiculously high turnover rate between the terrible pay and the lack of incentives to stay or do a good job. 

A few days after the new hire, *Kevin just never showed up, I take off for a little vacation in the tropics for a long weekend, not knowing what was about to happen...

*Everything you’re about to read has been compiled from watching the surveillance tapes, and the accounts of my breakfast lady, Miss. Sue, and the owners.*

Thursday night, the last day I had worked, while I was busy at home packing without a care in the world, Kevin walks into the hotel while our useless sack of night auditing potatoes *Michelle is working. He goes behind the front desk and grabs a master slide key, AND THIS IDIOT LETS HIM. I guess he told her he works here, but who the hell comes into a hotel not on their shift and needs a key? Who?? Tell me!!! Common sense, lady. Oh wait, potatoes can’t be bothered to think for themselves. 

He then proceeds to go upstairs out of her sight (god forbid she actually looks at the surveillance feed to see where he goes) and into a room. He stays in this room all night until the next day, where he comes downstairs to get breakfast with a towel draped over his head, in an attempt to hide his identity. 

Miss. Sue told me that she thought it was odd that a man came downstairs to get breakfast with a towel over his head, but that’s by far one of the lesser weird things people have worn/done to the breakfast room, so she chalked it up to an odd individual, or maybe his hair was wet or something. If anything, she was wondering if maybe he was one of the area’s many homeless, but since he carried his plate upstairs and she heard a room door shut, she figured that it’s just some strange guest staying here. 

Our beloved squatter Kevin proceeds to stay at our hotel in secret for another few nights, switching rooms each night after all the housekeepers had left and only using the side exits when entering and exiting the hotel. Had he been smart, he would have at least made the beds back up to conceal the fact that someone had been in the rooms, but alas, he wasn’t the brightest crayon in the box. He also didn’t come down for breakfast anymore, as I guess he got spooked/paranoid that someone might recognise him. 

By Sunday, several guests check in and immediately go back to the front desk to complain that their room is dirty. Three rooms of guests to be exact. One of the owners, *Mr. Crick is working the front desk during that time frame and just assumes that the housekeepers didn’t do their job, so when they arrive at work on Monday, he confronts then about the dirty rooms. They all insist that they had cleaned those rooms, and that those rooms had not been used/on their checkout sheet in a week or so. 

Of course Mr. Crick thinks they’re lying, because that’s just the type of person he is, but begrudgingly rewinds through the security feed anyways, just to see what was going on. It wasn’t long before he ran across our nightly visitor, and realised who it was, as during his nightly hallway strolls, he made no attempt to conceal his face, as I guess he knew that Michelle potatoes wasn’t checking the security feed. 

Enraged, Mr. Crick does one thing. He texts Kevin, asking him if he can come in to work later that day, because “we’re super busy and he needs the help”. *facepalm* Kevin texts back, of course, be there at 3:00pm. Once Kevin “arrives” (read, exit his room on the fourth floor, go down the side stairwell and out, around the building and back in through the front door, dressed to impress), Mr. Crick phones the local law enforcement from the phone in the laundry room (out of sight), requesting that an officer come out to the property. 

When the officer arrived, Kevin made it sound as if he *still* works here, he’s an employee, “look, see, I got a text from the owner telling me to come into work”, and the officer bought it. It’s worth nothing that Mr. Crick yelling and screaming the whole time in a fit of nonsense didn’t help the situation. I think he truly failed to make the officer realise the importance of the situation - that Kevin didn’t just have a room key - he had a set of master keys. But he didn’t, and the officer LET KEVIN GO. He let Kevin go without even viewing the security tapes; it’s like he couldn’t be bothered with this “petty hotel disagreement”. 

At one point, Mr. Crick finally got the idea kinda halfway across...the officer responded with, “Well, it’s just empty rooms, what’s really lost there? I don’t see the issue if there’s just a few dirty empty rooms?”. In which Mr. Crick exploded (I suppose rightfully so), screaming that he will report the officer to the city, and go and file a formal complaint with the main office. 

So here we come back full circle...my dumb ass arrives to work early Tuesday, as I’ve got a lot of paperwork to catch up on. The first thing I see when I open the door to the office entrance, where the time cards are located, is a large sign in comic sans font; typical Mr. Crick style - “KEVIN NOT WORK HERE NO MORE. NO LET HIM IN HOTEL”. I chuckled to myself and thought, “heh, wonder what the deal is”.....

Well, I now know the deal, and I’m the one who had to re-key the entire hotel, as of course stupid Kevin still is at large with a master slide key.

"For the past little while I have debated posting some of my front desk/housekeeping adventures. Today is the day I start. 

So the first place I ever worked FD was a little motel that had probably 50 rooms. It was on a very busy main road in town. My first training shift was from 3pm until 11pm.  Heck I even arrived early to make a good impression.

What greeted me upon arrival was the coroners van.

At that point I probably should have ran. I skeptically walked in and introduced myself to my trainer.  He fills me in on the sad situation that had happened ( A person had OD'd and there was a child in the room). 

My trainer realized a coroner van in front of a motel on a busy road was bad for business and asked them to move to the back of the building.

"Let me start by saying, I am an actor and have worked in hospitality as my ""day job"" since I graduated undergrad almost 5 years ago. I have a thick skin and am good at compartmentalizing and not taking things personally. However, I am human, and as we all do, I have my breaking point.

This tale takes place this past 2019 Christmas season. I was scheduled at my hotel Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, so I decided to stay in the city, and not to go home for the holidays. The second half of 2019 kicked my fucking ass. I was blindsided by the man I thought I was going to spend my life with, with a devastating breakup in late August. I won't bore you with the details, but essentially he got cold feet. We still love each other, there was no other reason for the breakup, my trust in people is shattered and my heart is beyond broken. The holidays were obviously a very special time for us, and getting through the holidays away from my family, all alone, without him... frankly sucked. I have clinical depression and was just getting myself through each day one step and one minute at a time.

One evening I was alone at the desk with my supervisor, let's call him Jake. Jake is in his mid thirties, has been in hospitality since he was 18 or so, and is impossible not to like. This particular night, I’d had to check in tons of happy couples, I was missing my ex, my heart felt heavy and like there was a knife in it. Basically all night, I felt like I was fighting tears. I even went in the bathroom to cry once. It's almost time to leave. Lobby is quiet. Jake and I are wrapping up our work and waiting for the night auditor to show up.  


Enter Drunk Asshole. Drunk Asshole was a dude is his late fifties/early sixties. He stormed up to my desk, and before I had even fully looked up from my computer, he lays into me. This dude wasn't talking loudly, or sternly, he's towering over me and yelling at me. Apparently his keys won't work .I apologize and offer to remake them. He's clearly tipsy and yells at me, basically repeating what he said before, demanding I ""compensate"" him in some way. Our hotel is located on a street that is famous for high end shopping, in an upscale downtown neighborhood of one of the largest cities in the US. I explain that the scanners that detect stolen items in the entrances of the stores often deactivate our keys. He doesn't listen. More yelling, being condescending, treating me like I'm not a human. My nose starts to sting, and I feel tears welling up in my eyes. I do NOT want to let Drunk Asshole see me cry, so I stare down at my keyboard as I make new keys for him. He sees me crying. He stops yelling for about 3 seconds, and then doubles down, continuing to tell me how completely unacceptable this situation is... I honestly tune him out at this point, and just focus on not completely breaking down, sorry for the lack of specific quotes here, but I was in self preservation mode the whole time.   


Jake has finished ringing up a few guests who were purchasing snacks from our market, and he rushes over, offering to escort the guest upstairs and make sure he is able to access his room with the new keys. The guest is pleased with this, and Jake escorts him to the elevators. They disappear, and I walk into the back office, put my head against the wall, let myself cry for about 15 seconds, and then suck it up, fix my makeup, and walk back to my desk.   


My phone rings. It's the room number of Drunk Asshole. I take a deep breath and answer in the most cheerful voice I can muster. Imagine my surprise when this man awkwardly APOLOGIZES to me, and thanks me for doing my job, saying he knows it's hard work. I sputter out some sort of response, I don't even remember what I said, and wished him a pleasant night and holiday season.  


Jake returns. I say ""That guy must have had a change of heart because he just called me and apologized.""

Jake says ""Well good. I checked him when we got in the elevator. That was so inappropriate.""   


Apparently, the conversation went some thing like this:  


Jake: ""Sir, the way you spoke to my associate was completely inappropriate. She's just doing her job.""  


Drunk Asshole, starting to look embarrassed ""Well.. you know... I mean I've had a few beers""  


Jake ""Sir, you and I both know that's not an excuse.""   


Drunk Asshole mumbles ""Yeah... yeah I know.."" and trails off awkwardly.   


Here's the best part. They walk up to Drunk Asshole's room. His Tipsy Wife and adult son are standing there. Jake looks at the door.   


""Sir, the reason your key wasn't unlocking the door, is because your door is ajar."" Jake reaches for the handle, pulls the door fully closed, slides the key in... green light. Door unlocked.  


Drunk Asshole is mortified. Hurries inside. Calls me to apologize.  


Hopefully he learned his lesson. And my supervisor is awesome.

"I work at a corporate-operated property so we adhere to corporate policy very strictly, even if the majority of other franchised properties don't. The one that gets us in trouble the most is the government rates. Official company-wide policy is only federal or state government employees get the rates. That means contractors don't, which ALWAYS leads to problems because most other properties avoid the headache by letting them get the rate even though they aren't supposed to.

I had a guy try to check in a couple weeks ago. He worked for a defense contractor, not actually with the Department of Defense. I tell him he can't get the government rate and of course he goes on his tirade about how he's stayed at 100's of hotels and has never been denied the rate. (Part of me believes him because I know how franchised properties operate but the other part of me thinks he's just telling me that so I'll override it for him). After a bit of yelling and throwing his *elite status* in my face, he finally says ""So are you going to make me stay somewhere because I am an *elite* member and I can tell you, you do not want to do that"". I tell him I'm not forcing him to leave, that I can offer him a room but at the regular rate. He finally just storms out, yelling about how the general manager and our corporate office will hear about this (of course, he wrote down my name).

This is a regular occurence. I understand why guests would be frustrated with the inconsistentcy. The blame is on lazy franchised properties who don't conduct the program like they're supposed to so it makes my property look bad. I get so nervous every time I see a government rate and have to ask for an ID because I've been yelled at too many times.Government rates are a nightmare",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I love this sub and have spent many a shift amusing myself with all the good stories, so figured I'd quit my lurking and share my story from tonight:

I recently made the switch to NA and have been lucky enough to have been given Mon-Thurs nights, so usually things are quiet and boring- just the way that I like it!

Tonight all check ins were done when I came on shift so it was going to be an early night with plenty of downtime to finish my week. Perfect.

I'm just finishing the audit reports and I hear someone come into the lobby, so as usual I check the cameras to see what I'm dealing with before going out front. I take one look and say to myself  ""no fucking way!"" There's an old man of about 70 completely naked standing at the front desk, no attempt to cover himself. I don't believe what I'm seeing at first.

I take an extra second to collect myself and put on my best customer service face, trying hard not to show my amusement at the situation.

NOF= Naked old fucker

Me= Yours truly

&amp;#x200B;

NOF: I'm locked out of my room, number 211

Me: I don't believe that there is a room 211 sir..

NOF: Well I'm so and so you can look it up!

ME: (Idiotically, still surprised) Can I see some ID?

NOF: I don't have anything as you can see!

ME: No problem sir, I'll look up your room number and go up there with you, I'll just have to see you ID before I give you the new key. Can I get you a towel?

NOF: No! Let's just go!

So I show him to his room and he goes inside and I hear some rustling and I figure he's going to put something on- Nope. He comes out with his ID still completely naked and I give him the new key and wish him a good night. Ugh

Just take the towel dude, Christ!My First Ever Naked Guest",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
" 

I work at a big brand hotel, and our rewards program lets us purchase master gift cards with points. They get given to you anonymously, and I got one with points, and purchased someone anger management courses for like 15$.

He wrote a horrible review for our hotel, saying that it was absolutely the worst experience that he ever had, with no other context. Well in the review he rated everything as low as a 1, and then said he had problems with the tv, heater, loud noises, his check in reception was horrible, check out reception was horrible and his bill resolution was horrible.

Now I gotta make one thing clear with this guy, the forum he filled out asks if you reported these problems, and he said he did and that he was ignored. Now think about that for a second, as a business if someone has that many problems, why, or *HOW* would he ever be ignored? That is like 45% of his room not working properly. Well the answer is, he didn't report a damn thing. I in fact know he didn't because it has been 2 people who worked with him at all. Myself, and my manager. My manager didn't give him bad service, I know her very well and that woman is great with people and has been doing this a long time. She was the one who checked him in, and I checked him out. Now when I checked him out the guy seemed pissed off. I asked him how everything was and he replied with a grumbly ""It was fine. I'm here to check out."" So I go through looking for him under our due out section and don't see him. Turns out he wants to leave a day early.

I normally am not allowed to let people leave early, however it was 7:30 in the morning and the guy seemed upset so I let it slide to hopefully make his day better. Our hotel charges at check in, which is told to the person as they check in. And I refund him the difference of his last night. I inform him it was a Thursday and refunds like that sometimes take a while to process that close to the weekend so he may likely see his money back the following week. We don't control the money his bank does, I just told him that as a courtesy. He nodded, thanked me, and told me to have a good morning and walked away. All while still kinda pissy. But not once did this man mention a problem with our hotel. For all I know he could have been fighting with his wife. He didn't seem to be directing it at me though, so I didn't think much of it. People sometimes just don't do well in the morning, it's not like it was extremely out of the ordinary.

And this spanned over one night. Our manager checked him in, I checked him out and we had our night auditor confirm not a damn peep from them between 11:00pm and 6:30am.

The only thing that may have even been considered bad service is that I was away from the desk for a moment. I was using the restroom lol, and when our clerks step away we take a phone with us and put a sign up with a number to call, and a house phone hangs on the wall behind it. It's a pretty good system. It helps people see that even if we're not immediately there, we are literally one call away. Well I come back after using the restroom to see him standing there waiting. Guy read the sign and everything, but didn't call the phone. I was gone at most 3 minutes, maybe five. But early in the day is the best time to take care of that stuff since most people check out between 9:00 and 11:00.

My point in all of this the guy seemed somewhat annoyed, but I wasn't about to pry him for answers. I asked if his stay was okay, and he told me it was fine in a fairly dismissive manner. Usually that's a cue to just shut up, and give them a receipt and wish them well.

But his review is genuinely terrible, nothing I have seen in three years of working here. Seemed to me a scheme to try and get some free points or worse yet a comped stay.

This man lied about reporting his problems, likely lied *about* the problems as we checked his room after the review came in and the tv and heater worked perfectly fine, didn't even give us an opportunity to try and make things better, and expected us to read his mind. If you don't ask you will not receive help. Hotels will happily fix anything for you, but we don't know unless you tell us, in fact you really should tell us! You might make it worse for someone else inadvertently. If his TV really wasn't working, why in the hell would he not call someone or come to the desk? If his bill was not properly resolved why have we not heard from him, that *is* his money he so openly said we fucked up. Apparently his check in and check out service was horrible. I can't really speak for myself, I know I'm not God's gift to desk clerks, but I know damn well his check in went just fine. Our manager would have mentioned it if anything was wrong, that's how hotels work! If something goes wrong, it gets passed on so you don't get blindsided. I even asked her about it after we saw the review and she didn't think anything was wrong at all the whole night. At least in regards to him.

So for once I decided to take some revenge. I took his email, and name and signed him up for anger management courses. He was clearly too inept emotionally to express his dissatisfaction with us through big boy words, so I figured get him enrolled! I really wish I could see the phone call he got from them, but alas that will never happen. But I can rest easy knowing I just spent 15 imaginary dollars on absolutely nothing but a goofy ass smile on my face. Hopefully he is doing well, and the therapy has done him some good. Never received a call about his bill, so I guess whatever problem he had with it is just going to be left unchanged.

TL;DR: Guest at our hotel lied about a bunch of problems, so I bought them anger management courses.First Post! A lengthy revenge story",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I once worked the front desk of a small hotel. I worked second shift, getting off work at 10pm. I should mention this was way before google and WIFI in every room.

So this hotel had a movie rental program. As I said before, this is a long time ago so the videos were VHS. There were maybe 20 movies ranging from cartoons to rated R and they were organized in a wood bookcase. On top of the bookcase were several movies in black covers. Those were the adult movies, AKA: Porn. Being that I worked the later shift near people's bedtime, I was the one who did the majority of porn renting. 

The staff hated the adult movies. There was nothing more awkward than a creepy man handing you a black box movie to rent, knowing he was going to go upstairs and whack it. It was even worse when they returned the movie, nobody wanted to touch them. We kept cleaning solution behind the desk for such cases. There was only one time I felt the need to use it. 

A man one night checked in alone, went straight to the movie section and grabbed a black box. I smiled politely, trying not to judge as he headed to his room. Maybe 30 minutes passed and he returned. He looked sweaty and had changed into sweatpants that showed his...um, excitement. He put the box on the counter, grabbed another and asked to rent that one next. It wasn't very often I had someone rent two porno's back to back. I wanted him to get away because his erection was making me uncomfortable. He went back upstairs with his new movie. 

30-40 minutes later he was back. I hadn't touched his previous movie so he just placed the second tape on top of it, grabbed a third one and asked to rent it too. I worked at being professional as I scanned the movie box and handed it to him. His pants were still loose and I did my best not to look at him below his neck. 

An hour later he's back again. He rented a fourth porn movie, and then a fifth right before I left for the night. The tapes were stacked on the counter, I had been procrastinating cleaning them off. When the next clerk came in, I told her the story and she was kind enough to help me wash off the tapes while we giggled about it.

I went home but was told later that the man returned to the front desk 3 more times. He basically watched every adult movie we had. An hour after he returned the last one, around 4am, he checked out. I'm still grossed out by the encounter and it's been 20+ years!That time I worked at a hotel (front desk) that rented adult movies",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I worked as the night auditor for 3 years at a 2 star hotel, just recently the FDM quit and I was offered the position with a raise.  So I took it kind of reluctantly because I am well aware that if someone doesn't come in for their shift, I have to work theirs and mine which is 11-7.  There are 2 FDA that are remnants from the last manager that quit by no show, no call.  As soon as I took the position all hell broke loose.  I had to fire the weekend auditor which left me to work 7 night shifts a week.  I hired some young girl for the weekend audit but she no showed, no called after one week.  So here we go again.  The general manager put this girl from housekeeping as my assistant.  She doesn't assist me in anything.  She calls off at least 3 shifts a month and is late at least 3 of her 5 shifts.  When I try to take some type of action upper management shoots me down.  I'm feeling what is the point of me being the manager when I'm being micro managed by them.  I can't really make any real decisions to improve the FD.  When the other manager was here, she hired all her little friends and they ran amuck!!!!!  Now I'm trying to save the sinking ship but I see i'm fighting a losing battle.  This place is run like Junior High School instead of an establishment.  One good thing though, at least it's not our peak time.  It's slow and I have a lot of down time to blog, catch up on my shows etc.  I am 62 years old and will retire in a few years thank God.  But it baffles me how some of these young people have no work ethic.  They are consistently late (20-30 minutes, sometimes more), consistently calling off or not even showing up.  Upper management is forever making excuses for them.  Thank God, I hired this one girl who is awesome, she is always early, willing to work extra shifts even the night audit.  She is really worth her weight in gold.  Don't know what I would do if it weren't for her saving me.  At this point I don't even know if I even want to be here for the summer when we get super busy.  I'm too old to work 16 hour shifts back to back plus the night audit.  Think I'll go back to CVS or Bank of America.Manager madness",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

Sorry for possible formatting issues. Like a lot of you, I love this sub. Many years ago, I worked as an FDA during college. Not many memorable stories but here’s one.

I had this young couple (very early 20’s around my age) in house when I got a complaint one night about possible pot smoke in the hallway. I make my way up to the hallway and find the source of the smell. 

I knocked on the door and the dude denied it was him. He copped a hateful attitude until I pointed over his shoulder at his bong and said “then why do you have that?” I then kicked them out and charged them the cleaning / no smoking fee.

A few days later I get a call from an irate guy asking why he was charged so much. I explain that his son whom he had given permission to use said card was charged for cleaning and smoke damage. The father then apologized and said he’d handle it and hung up. 

This is why when you get caught doing something you aren’t supposed to, that you don’t act like an asshole in response! 

Be smart with your drug use people...

TLDR- young guy gets an attitude when caught smoking pot in room. Kicked out and upset father has to pay the bill.Don’t get an attitude when caught being stupid.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"On January 9th, an older man we'll call Jimbo and his wife checked in. Using shmoetels.com, over the course of the next 11 days they stayed across a couple different reservations before finally checking out on the 20th.

Over the course of their stay, we never got any complaints, and they checked out with me Monday morning.

Yesterday when I was working the evening shift, I got a call from shmotels.com. Apparently someone tried to rob Jimbo during his stay! This was the first I'd heard about it, so when shmotels wanted compensation for the guest, I told them I couldn't offer it as I was unfamiliar with the event in question. They'd have to talk to the owner the next day.

I thought that was the end of it, but shot the owner a text to see if I'd missed anything. No response because he has a life and his cousin is in town. It's not a big deal.

A half an hour later shmotels calls again. Different rep, same customer, different story. Apparently he was ACTUALLY robbed! How frightening. I inform the rep they're second person who has called regarding the matter, but they will get the same response as the first: I'm not authorizing any compensation since I don't know the sitch. They have to talk to the owner the next day.

So I after I hang up with them I call the owner to get the low down.

Here's what actually happened: On Saturday the 18th, the guest was out walking his dog at night and saw some legitimately suspicious characters out in the median of the highway we're on. These guys were wearing bandannas over their faces. Jimbo told the front desk about it, front desk called the police, the guys were scared off. The next day, Jimbo followed up with the owner to see what had happened with the guys.

That was literally it.

Then he called shmotels twice four days later to try to get a discount or refund.

Just kidding, he called them three times.

The third time the rep called asking for permission to give Jimbo a full refund, stating that Jimbo had not stayed and told them the hotel had already given their approval. I told this rep the same thing I'd told the first two, and he was appropriately confused.

Maybe the reps finally communicated to each other and realized they'd all gotten different stories from the same guy, because he gave up after that. So far.Third time isn't the charm when you're trying to get your money back.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So, It's my Monday. We are going to be sold out this weekend with various college sports, and a local event. We are under a winter weather advisory this weekend and there's a good chance things are going to suck. When I ended my weekend on Monday morning we were oversold by 4 rooms for Friday. I come in tonight and we now have 20 to sell. Yay!

As I'm locking the entry way, a cop car shows up and 2 dudes get out. Of course that's a red flag, but whatever I'll see where this goes. 

1st guy asks about the cheapest room I can offer, every other word out of his mouth is ""fuckin"" so I raise the rate and give him the price. He agrees so I ask for ID &amp; CC. Now the story starts. He got mugged and they stole all of his stuff, he tells me that's why he brought the other dude with him, because he has an ID. Um, ok. Muggings are not really a thing here but sure,, that's what happened.  2nd dude gives me his ID (of course he's a local.) and the 1st gives me a netspend card. I already know how this will turn out but I continue to humor them. 

Card declines. I inform the dude that it's declined and he says my favorite phrase. ""Well yeah, there's no money on it."" I don't understand this mindset of why people think that it works that way so I apologize and tell him I cannot check him in with a declined card. Dude 2 seems to get what I'm saying but this just pisses off dude 1. He pulls out a piece of paper with a card number on it and tells me to run that one. I'm over it at this point and tell him that I cannot do that. He tries to argue with me while trying to type the number into the machine. Of course customer facing machines do not work that way, and I inform him as such, and that without a physical card, I cannot possibly accept this number. 

He finally flips his shit demanding to know why so I start from the beginning. 1. You don't have an ID. 2. The credit card needs to be in the name of the registered guest. 3. No where in their right mind will take a card number that is written on a piece of paper. 4. This whole thing has felt shady since you walked in the door. 

He tells me I'm lying, and that you can absolutely type in a number on the customer key pad and that I just must not know how to do it. Then he said those 3 magic words. ""Call your manager."" Now I love it when they tell me that because that's when we're done talking. I was flat out ""Yeah,,, no. I'm the one here, so I'm the one in charge. I will not be calling my manager for something that makes no sense for us to do in the first place. At this point, you cannot provide me with an ID, or a credit card so there is nothing left for us to discuss.""

He stomped off to try his luck at the no-tell motel next door. I don't have a lot of faith in that place, but even they're not stupid enough to run a credit card number that's written on a piece of scrap paper.The start of another great work week",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It's fun to have a new story to share! I haven't worked at the desk in a while since I moved onto more senior hotel management, but since I don't celebrate Christmas, I volunteered to cover the Christmas Eve &amp; Christmas shifts so our GSAs that do celebrate are able to be with their families. (Hanukkah Nights 3 &amp; 4 just isn't that big of a deal to my family. Plus, when I need an extra day / favor in the future, everyone's more likely to help me out. I'm not that altruistic)

So I'm working the front desk on Christmas Eve - slow night, maybe 25 check ins - easy night. I'll browse reddit, go down a TV Tropes or Wikipedia hole - Honestly, the hardest part was remembering how difficult it is to stand for 8 hours at a time without actually walking. 

But this guy comes downstairs, angry as all heck, and immediately says without context ""I'll never stay here again!"" I put on my nice-to-guest-but-really-annoyed-face and ask what happened? He goes on for 2 minutes about some construction noise he heard at 10:00 AM (we are doing some small renovations, but he was 6 floors removed from it), and said his shower water temperature kept changing. 

OK, valid complaints. Now, understand my way of dealing with guests is to be direct - ask what they want. That way you don't overshoot by giving up too much, and most folks appreciate being asked. It's also a good way to deescalate a situation. If a guest is angry but you offer an open ended question, they take a moment to think to themselves ""What was this inconvenience worth?"" So instead of a full night, maybe breakfast, points, a few drinks at the bar - whatever.

But not this guy. He immediately says ""I want a refund for last night"". Well, while I'm authorized to do so, I didn't like this guy's attitude. So I look in my computer at his reservation to look at his value to the hotel. Since I'm not always at the desk I don't know people's names as well as I'd like to. I see he's part of our frequent guest program; not top tier but not lower tier either. Just as I was figuring out what to offer him, he says ""I can't believe you asked me that! You should've offered me a free night"".

So, something about me - I have zero tolerance for people being rude to our front desk staff. I tell them all the time, if I'm here and someone yells or starts to swear, come get me right away. Well here was a chance to practice what I preach. I don't do service recovery to rude people. I understand you can have a bad stay, and maybe you deserve it - but rule #1 of being human is ""Don't be an asshole to someone who didn't personally cause your problem"". This guy broke my rule. 

Well, this is where being a senior manager has it's perks. I look at him and say ""I'm sorry sir, I won't be offering you anything. Have a good evening"". You'd think I just told him his mother was a hamster and father smelt of elderberries. His face gets beat red, and is stunned for a moment. I honestly thought I saw smoke coming from his ears. He's clearly never had anyone say no to him like this. So he asks for a manager, and I tell him I'm the most senior manager at the hotel this evening, and I won't be reaching out to the GM on Christmas Eve, as they have young kids. He recovers, and calls me jackass. OK, cool. I've been called  worse by better.  Then he walks away, and as he does, he lifts up his left arm and tells me to go f*ck myself. Merry Christmas to you too, buddy.

About 20 minutes later he comes down and yells at me as I'm checking in a guest that he'll tell the GM of the hotel about what a horrible attitude I have. As I was checking in someone else, he was ignored. 

And, just to be sure, I sent our engineer up to the room to test the shower. Water temperature was stable and as it should be. *I was shocked.*

I did go ahead and fill out a report to the brand, just in case he decided to complain. Also looped in my GM and hotel ops team. He complained at checkout, but no one gave him anything. 

It's nice to get to the point where you can say no to a guest. Don't risk your jobs over it, of course - I knew I could get away with it. But man, I hate people like that. Makes me glad I'm not full time at the desk anymore!The Joy of Christmas",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Don't mind me, just taking a quick 10 minute lunch/dinner break on the back half of my shift to eat my reheated mystery meat deli sandwich after getting fucked in the ass many times by many Karens.

If I see you on the cameras hanging around the desk while I'm chowing down, I assume you're either checking in or your keys don't work or something else important that can't wait (or maybe you can hear me tearing apart that sandwich like a hungry wolf on a fresh carcass). I've started putting the 'away' sign on the counter to try and filter the interruptions down to those specific things (or market purchases, but if you do anything but charge it to the room I'll be very salty), in the hopes that anyone with a ticky-tack question or concern will move it along or at least save it for later.

Does it stop people? Fuck no. Can always count on some liver-spotted old geezer in a cowboy hat to come up to the desk and say ""hello?"" without even looking at the sign to draw me out, only to tell me that the restaurant I referred him to was great and give me a thumbs up.

Do we have a bar here? No, we don't. Two star hotel. Double-digit room rates tonight.

"Our hotel allows members to stay for free on points. Top tiers members, most of them are entitled to free upgrades. But we do have to charge a fee for an upgrade, but for this one man I let it slide and later ended up regretting it.

Now so keep in mind I never upgrade ppl for free until I had a gentlemen call for a possible upgrade over the phone.

Code; Entitled man EM: entitled man, M:me

EM: This is (first,last name), I'm staying on points so I'm wondering about a possible upgrade as a (top level member name that rhymes with fire).

\*\*I don't say yes or no simply because since we were booked all weekend, this was on Monday, I have no suites clean and couldn't contact housekeeping\*\*

M: If I have a suite available, I certainly will do

EM: What do you mean, I want the upgrade, you should be able to, I am a (fire) member

M: Yes sir, the thing is, is that I will have to wait until housekeeping notifies me whichever room is clean because we've been full all weekend.

EM: Well okay, so this means depending on what is clean, is what I get?

M: Correct

EM: Will do thanks, I'll be there in about an hour.

M: For sure, see you then

\* The only suite I had available for 4 nights for him was a ADA accessible romance suite, its a gorgeous room, with a Jacuzzi, fireplace, a couch and a roll in shower w/bars (thats the only difference). With lots of room\*

Now around 6, he gets here, I greet him and notified him that I was able to upgrade him however what I had was the handicap suite. He begins to fight with me, about I wasn't ""prepared"" for him and his stupid ass status. I briefly explain its the only suite I had, if he didn't want it, I could move him to a 2 queens room or stay with a king originally. He refused and said ""thats not an upgrade.""  I saw him browse online looking for a suite, and duhh no suites on there either jackass. (If there was I put them OOO) I became annoyed because then he tells me ""if he can go look at it"". I gave him one of his keys. I immediately call my boss and told him what happened including to decide to upgrade this guy for free and was ungrateful for it, also explained to him that I notified the guest it IS ADA accessible. He told me not to worry and was laughing ""because what else does he fucking want? If thats all you have, that is that you have."" I saw the EM coming up pissed so I told my boss I'll call back later.

EM comes in and said ""there's got to be another suite available""

M: No sir thats all I have

EM: Wheres your manager? This is unacceptable, I am a (fire ali) member.

M: There is no manager on duty

EM: Call your f\*\*\*\*\*\* boss then!

\* I call my boss again, and said ""he wants to speak to you"" \*

This asshole takes my phone outside, and began to argue about how we didn't prepare for his arrival. My boss briefly told him we were understaffed that day, booked all weekend, also even told him that we usually charge fees for an upgrade. If he doesn't want it then he can stay the room HE booked himself.  Almost the same shit I told him earlier but for some reason he decided to fight.

After he returned he half assed apologized to me, (it must've hurt him to admit he was in the wrong)

4 days later he then gets rewarded with 10k points for upcoming stays.

Which doesn't make sense because I thought my boss had my back so why reward this guy with 10K points? Especially since this was no one's problem but his. But whatever. Mostly mad at myself for even upgrading this guy in the first place.Being an asshole gets you awarded",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I get a call from let’s call him “the noid”. 

Noid wants to make a reservation for an upcoming event weekend. Prices of course go up. I quote him the price and he automatically shoots me down saying that this group booked a block of rooms and the rate is 115+tax. 

My boss always sends me e-mails about any event quotes he had given out. No e-mail. Luckily my boss was here so I said,

“Sir let me check and verify that price for you.” 

My boss tells me he hasn’t quoted 115 for anyone and that nobody has made a room block for that weekend. 

My boss decides he wants to take the call. He sits down at the desk, sees caller ID, and takes the noid off hold. 

“Hello Mr. Noid, I’m calling from blank how are you?”

“Um hi.”

“I understand you have been quoted a ra-“

“To be honest I’m pretty freaked out you know my last name and you looked at the caller ID. I didn’t tell the other lady my name.” 

So now the noid is like super skeeved out. 

They get the rates situated and my boss tells him that he’s handing him back over to me to finish his reservation.

“Okay, sir. I will just need...” 

Last name, first name

Zip code. Verified the city name with him.

Contact number

“Now I’ll just need a card to hold your room with.”

“Woah you are going all over the place! Why are you getting my info like this?! It’s already weird you knew my name. Looking at the caller ID.”

“Sir this is how we always make reservations I follow the order in which the computer says to go...” 

“Well you aren’t going to charge my card right?”

“Not until you get here.”

“I might want to pay cash.”

“Okay I just want to let you know if you pay cash there will be a $100 dollar hold for incidentals that you can do in cash or card.”

“WHAT?! I just gave you my card that’s your incidentals! You don’t need to charge it.” 

“Sir, we have to collect incidentals. You can pay a 100 additional dollars in cash which you get back at the end of the stay or we can put a 100 dollar hold on your card when you arrive.” 

“No no honey you aren’t getting 100 dollar cash!.” 

“Doesn’t have to be cash sir we can put a hold on your card.”

*proceeds to treat me like an idiot who has no idea what I am talking about.*

“You don’t need a 100 dollars when you have my card on file!” 

*Siiighhhh*

“It doesn’t work like that sir. We can put a hold on the card at check in or we will need a 100 dollars cash.”

“That’s what I’m saying! I don’t know why you are bringing up incidentals when I just gave you my card.”

“That card is to hold the room. But at check in we can put the hold on that card if that is what you decide.”

“Exactly! That’s what I’ve been saying?!”

WHAT. NO ITS NOT. YOU DIDNT WANT TO PAY CASH AND YOU DIDNT WANT A HOLD ON YOUR CARD.

*im completely done*

“No sir, that is exactly what I’ve been saying.” 

The noid goes silent. 

(He’s thinking about telling me to shove my incidentals where the sun doesn’t shine.)

"One of our housekeepers is pretty known for being a drama starter but she is good at her job. Lets call her Jane. 

One day I was in the laundry room in the morning as housekeeping was stocking the cart. Jane is talking about changing the sheets in the stays and how it would be easier if the dates people are staying were on the sheet that we print out for them that shows the stays and the check outs. 

It is our head housekeepers job to write which rooms need sheets changed anyways and Jane is not our HH so I dont know why she cares so much. 

Anyways I joked about how she should call corporate and tell them to add it. And she says there probably is a way to do it. There isn't. I know for a fact there isn't. So of course I tell her that their isn't a way to do it. And she tells me that there is a way to do it front desk are just too lazy to figure it out. Um excuse me?? What nerve on this chick to say that to me. She has no clue what a front desk clerk does in a day and she has no clue how computers even work. Last week she literally asked me how to send an email. But she is sooo sure there is something we could do to make the dates print on these sheets. 

I don't know if it is like this at every hotel but at this one for some reason the housekeeping are so attitudey towards the front desk. They think that just because our jobs are not physical like their are our jobs are just a breeze.  

And that same day right before this conversation happened some guest freaked out at me and almost made me cry because she had to pay taxes on her room even though she had a treaty card (we are no where near being on treaty land) so I was already in a bad mood.This is not a tale about a guest but one about a housekeeper",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Y'all....I've about had it with fully grown men throwing temper tantrums in our lobby. Whether it be because I can't put them right next to their family on a full occupancy day or because we had to put them in the identical room next to the one they *wanted*. I have to bite my tongue to keep from telling them I know 3 year olds that are better behaved than them. 

So this guy comes in, and according to the morning shift he had gotten upset because the candles in our wall sconce were not actual candles and didn't have a scent. He then made a creepy statement about the young front desk girl needing to wear perfume for him instead. 

The next day this guy requests his room to be serviced, but he has to be in the room and it has to be a certain housekeeper that he had met in the elevator earlier. Our front desk supervisor gives a firm no to that one, seeing as he had followed this housekeeper around all day and had just been generally predatory to several young girls that work at the hotel since his arrival. 

Well, since this guy didn't get his way, he decides to leave, despite telling the housekeeper that he was flying out tomorrow. It's around 5pm and he comes up to the front desk and says that he is leaving and that we shouldn't charge him. I inform him of our late checkout policy which has a cut off of 2pm and only then for elite members, as most hotels do, and since he had not even given us notice about this 'late checkout', he will be charged. After much insistence on his end, I end up calling the office manager who, of course, says to charge him for the night. 

The guest has now left and asked to be called after I spoke to a manager. I call him, let him know that we'll be charging him and he goes off about seeing the housekeepers still cleaning rooms and that they can just clean his room. Its not even dirty! Well the housekeepers are checking their last rooms and no, we will not clean your room just so you won't be charged, you can talk to management in the morning. ""It'll be too late then, you'll have already charged me"", he says. Well yes, I say, as that's the point. 

And then... he says ""well you're unpleasant, aren't you?"" and it's all I can do to keep from laughing at him right then and there. 

I panic and say ""yep, thank you!"" And after a moment of silence, click. He hangs up. 

Probably not my finest moment of customer service but my management thought it was hilarious. 

Now, I will make exceptions for people who have extenuating circumstances or a good rapport with the hotel. This man has been nothing but a creepy asshole. Why the hell would he think that we would break policy for him? The absolute numpty. I'm not going to grovel at your feet, because the truth is: we don't want you. We don't want you to come back. In fact, please don't. 

I later spoke to the housekeeper that he had been creeping on and she said he told he that he is a hedge fund manager. It all makes sense now.

This definitely isn't the wildest of my stories but it pretty much sums up the daily interactions I have with people. I'm not sure they realize that we mostly just laugh at how obscenely stupid they are.Wherein a guest tries to check out at 5pm and demands not to be charged",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hi guys! Here's a tale of when I used to work the desk at a salon and spa.

I was still fairly new when this little event happened, maybe not even employed for a full year yet. Shortly after I started at the salon, we moved locations to a new spot about two blocks away. This spot was way better, a much bigger space with even more parking. However, the new location was next to a very popular brunch place and some other medical offices. So during certain hours, weekends especially, parking would be HORRENDOUS!!! Seriously, you could do laps in the parking lot for 20+ minutes and still not find a spot. Therefore, especially after we moved locations, we always told guests on the phone to arrive at least 15-20 minutes BEFORE the start of their appointment to allow some time to find parking.

Here's another thing to note: Anyone showing up 10+ minutes late to their service would have their spot immediately forfeited and would need to come back another day. EVEN IF THEY WERE IN THE PARKING LOT THE WHOLE TIME TRYING TO FIND A SPOT! I understood why we were doing it, it just sucks being the bearer of bad news.

Here's where the late client comes in to play. This guest claimed that she was a regular client of my salon owner/boss (who also did hair a couple of days out of the week at each of his two salons). I remember this guest's appointment was scheduled in our opening hours on a Saturday, which meant that the parking lot outside was crazy busy. I remember her calling the salon because she went to the old location instead of the new one. Okay, a slight red flag if you're a ""regular"" because we had already been at the new spot for a few months. I give her easy directions, it was a straight shot around the corner and through a parking structure from the old spot to the new spot. I kindly asked if she could get here as soon as possible because late guests were subject to get rescheduled.

Then....

She finally walks into our salon, husband and stroller in tow, at least 15 minutes late to her haircut. My boss's appointments ran on 30-minute blocks, meaning every 30 minutes a guest is starting their service with him. If guests are arriving at the salon 15 minutes before the start of their appointment, this means she arrived at about the same time as my owners NEXT guest. She was clearly very upset when she arrived because she knew I was about to tell her that she needs to come back another day. My owner must've been able to tell this might go south when she came in and I remember him stepping away from his current client to have a chat with her.

I start working with another client who was paying for their services, and that's when I heard ""FUCK YOU ASSHOLE!"" from the late guest as my boss is opening the front doors to kick her and her family out. EVERYONE in the salon turned to see what was happening, and I remember another client who was cashing out staring with wide eyes and giggling.

This late guest did NOT like that she was being turned away. And I completely understand that it's super frustrating trying to get somewhere and being turned away at the last second. But sometimes people don't like to see things from the other perspective; That if you're not on time for your appointment, it makes the stylist run late for the rest of their day. Running behind as a stylist is EXTREMELY stressful!!!

*You're on time when you're 5 minutes early. You're late when you're on time.*

I wish that was branded into everyone's brains. I freak out if I'm arriving even 5 minutes before the start of any appointment.

I don't remember her getting irate with me, this happened almost 7 years ago, but I do remember my boss telling me afterward to never allow ANYONE to talk down or disrespectful to me. He told me that the late guest only comes 4 times a year with him (every 12 weeks). He has way more guests he sees anywhere between 4 weeks to 8 weeks. So she wasn't a ""regular"" enough for him to fuck up the rest of his day for.

This story probably came out much longer than it needed to, but I do have other wild stories both from my time at the salon as well as from my current job at my cute little boutique hotel if anyone is interested. Like the time a stalker came into the salon with a machete on his belt, and another time when this tiny little girl caused $3K in damages to a suite and had to get carried out by police.

"My property used to have a promotion where during the week, guests would get a free candy bar and a $5 voucher for our casino. At the first of the year, the new Front Desk manager decided to do away with the free candy bar promotion. A few regular guests were slightly put out by this, but they got over it. But not the guy I had to deal with at the beginning of my NA shift tonight. Oh no, this guy was gonna get a free candy bar by God, and he was gonna let me know about it!

So this Big Baby Man or BBM for short spent the first 15 minutes of my shift ragging on the guy I was relieving and then me for not being able to get a free candy bar.

BBM (very drunk. Forgot to mention that): I mean, I come every three or four years and I usually bring five other rooms with me and I can’t get a free candy bar?!

Swing shift FD person: I’m sorry sir, but policies change all the time.

BBM: When’s your manager coming in? I’m gonna give him a piece of my mind.

Swing shift FD person: 9 AM. I’m sure he’ll be happy to talk to you about it.

BBM: I don’t wanna bitch, I mean the rooms are cheaper than the last time we stayed here, but I really think I should be able to get my free candy bar.

Now, this whole time, I’ve just been counting the till and staying out of it, but then he turns his attention over to me.

BBM: So you’re taking over now?

Me:  Mmm hmm.

BBM: So if the drawer’s off by say $2, do I get a free candy bar then?

Me: No sir.

BBM: I just don’t think it’s fair that you give people free candy bars and then take ‘em away. It’s bullshit is what it is. But oh well.

He then drunkenly stared at me for several uncomfortably long seconds before he shuffled off to I don’t care where.

But as I was typing this out, he came back. And I thought for sure that he was going to start in about the candy bar again, but he just thought I looked bored and wanted to say hi. So I guess I’ve made a friend. Huzzah!

"So, I work in a hotel that has full apartments rather than just rooms. We mainly have one bedrooms that can be double or twin but we also have a handful of 2 &amp; 3 bedrooms that can also be adjusted as such.


Anyway, we have a dance company staying with us during their show's run time in our city as our hotel is a stone's throw away from the theatre, they have just arrived today.



We are now completely 100% occupied.



So it's mainly 2 people apartment or 1 person (if they're ""important"") as well as 4 per 2 room and 6 per 3 room etc. After the chaos of checking everyone in and showing them where to go about 10 mins later I get a call from one of the ""Important Managers"".


IM:""Hello, I'm extremely dissatisfied with the room I've been given, I was expecting at least a two bedroom apartment as I am *the* tour manager.""

Me:""My apologies, unfortunately due to your dance company taking up the entire occupancy of our hotel there is nowhere to move you to, all our larger apartments are being fully utilised and only few people have an entire apartment to themselves, yourself included.""

IM:""But I'm *the* tour manager this is unacceptable that I'm being given one of your standard apartments!""

Me:""I can only apologise again but there just isn't any space, if you'd like to speak to a manager he'll be in tomorrow from 08:00 but at this point in time there's not much I can do.""

IM""*Scoffs* Ugh, fine."" Hangs up.


Alrighty then, what a wonderful individual. Now for some lovely bonus info: As I was on the phone one of the dancers had returned to reception as her key had deactivated and she generally heard what the gist of my conversation was about. 


Dancer:""Was that ""Important Manager"" on the phone?""

Me:""How did you know?""

Dancer:""He always demands the best room available and on top of this he's a complete sexist pig with all the woman dancers.""

Me, trying to keep my professional composure:""Oh, that's not too good, especially with how many female dancers you have, not that I could have an opinion of him I've only met him.""

Dancer:""Don't worry he's an absolute dick.""

"Not a rant this time, but a heartwarming story for those Front Desk agents starting out or have yet to break the ice with the other departments.

Prior to reentering the hospitality industry I owned a small cleaning business in Los Angeles for house cleaning. It was just myself and since a lot of family related issues were going on I was basically keeping the family afloat. 16 hours a day 29 - 30 days a month I cleaned homes (this includes travel) and after I was done I'd spend 2 hours doing admin tasks. However, I was barely pulling in 1300 a month net and ended up living out of my car to shorten the time it took to travel jobs. That lasted 7 months before my body gave out.

I noticed at the small property I worked at the cleaning staff were sometimes abrasive with the manager/supervisor and some other FD staff. Not mean, but not the most bonded. One day I was sitting with the staff who barely knew english during a lunch break. I'd always joke around and ask how everyone was doing etc. Often times hearing the difficulties of the job, being overworked etc. Half truth, half general complaints from periodic short staffing. When I joked around about me being a cleaner before and losing half my sense of smell they laughed. They asked me if I had family or why I was working there. I told them what I did prior during my days of housecleaning and showed them pictures I took. Their eyes lit up surprised by the work I did and amount of hours I put in. As if I was speaking their language fluently. I told them the way it felt, the fatigue and so forth and that I understand what they are going through when rushed, short staffed, etc. That it was the reason I'd make guests wait with an overhead of 10 - 20 minutes depending on if they had to stop in the middle of a room to clean another for an arrival. Not to put down my other coworkers, but it's difficult to understand what the cleaning staff goes through unless you've done it yourself for a certain period of time. Some had two jobs, others one, ones who barely see their children etc.

Since then I've noticed even when tired, the cleaning staff are very responsive and patient towards me when I inquire about anything from lost and found to having to stop cleaning one room and moving on to another when a guest arrives early. Not to say they don't do the same for the other staff, but I don't hear them complaining as much around me and at times even joking about how busy a day is or what they will do to relax after.

Needless to say, and may be common knowledge, for any new FD agent gaining the respect and understanding of the cleaning staff goes a long way especially if you aren't fluent in their language. Of course this depends on your location and the housekeeping staff, but at least at my location it's worked out this way.

Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger! 

Due to a few downvoted comments regarding the nature of this post I want to clarify the intent. I've noticed in previous properties there can be a fairly large disconnect between the Front Desk staff and Maintenance / Cleaning staff. This can create a void between colleagues, even conflict due to different backgrounds and viewpoints during heavier shifts. My experience in cleaning homes prior to being hired where I am is less about that part of my life and more on being able to relate to the lives and/or work of people who can only work those jobs.Respect From The Cleaning Staff Goes Along Way",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"A couple of weeks back, I came in for my usual 3-11 shift, and before I could even clock in (not a big deal as I was there 30 minutes early, as always), 2 guests come in to tell my co-worker and myself that there is a lady in the hallway of the next building (our hotel has one building of guest rooms, the other building is offices, meeting rooms, breakfast area, and a bar and grill) who is only wearing a t-shirt.  Knowing some of our clientele, my first thought was Great, a crackhead before my shift even starts.

I tell my co-worker that I will go over there and handle it.  I let myself into the building and there she is:  A tiny little old lady wearing nothing but slippers and a t-shirt.  She is standing near the heater, shivering.  The cast:  Me; duh  CW: co-worker, GM: general manager, L: Laverne (not her real name), P: Police SD: shitty daughter LB: lying boyfriend of SD.

Me:  Did you forget your room number, dear?

L:  No, they dropped me off here.

Me: Who did?

L: The people I was babysitting for.

Me:  Do you know their name?

L:  No.  They are coming back to pick me up though.

Me:  Let's go to the lobby, it's a lot warmer there.

As we make our way - slowly - to the lobby, my CW comes out and sees us and goes to get the GM.  GM sees us and gets a wheelchair and blanket and brings them out to me.  We get Miss Laverne in the chair and covered up.  While GM wheels her to the lobby, I run ahead and call 911 for police and an ambulance.  Once we have emergency services on the way, we sit down to talk to Miss Laverne.  She isn't completely coherent, she changes her age a few times (90, 92, 102), and is confused about where she is, but otherwise she seems okay.  Rescue shows up and her vitals are okay - she isn't complaining of any pain anywhere, she is just confused.  When the police show up, she gives them the same story she gave to us about being dropped off, but the people are coming back to get her.  As the police talk to her some more, about 15 minutes go by and in walks her Shitty Daughter.

SD:  MOM!  I've been looking all over for you!

L:  I was right here where you dropped me off.

P: Ma'am, did you drop her off here?

SD:  Oh no.  She does this all the time.  She wanders away from the RV or room where ever we are.  I've been driving around this hotel for 45 minutes looking for her.

The Police look over at me, CW, and GM - we all shake our heads ""no"" as we have not seen her vehicle at all.

The police question the two of them some more and SD convinces the police that mom isn't ""right in the head"" and they leave.  SD wheels mom out to take her back to the room.  LB brings the wheelchair back and he says that L NEVER does this, she always just sits in the room/RV watching TV and they had only been gone to the store for 45 minutes. 

Since the stories didn't match up, CW and I discussed calling in Adult Protective Services, but we were told that we needed proof of neglect or abuse.  Apparently, eye witness accounts and emergency services records aren't enough.

Haven't seen L since then, although SD and LB are still here.  I've asked LB about her, but he just ignores the question.The Half Naked Miss Laverne",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Guy comes in for his reservation, paid for by his boss with an authorization form. He gives me his ID, a consular ID from Guatamala, only it's not in a single card. It's two loose plastic sheets and the paper form in between them.

Interestingly and alarmingly enough, all of the pertinent information, like the photo, date of birth, name, and ID number are on the plastic, with the paper insert being a blank ID.

Worse, these sheets were dirty as hell on both sides, making information like the expiration date unreadable.

He asks me as best he could why I can't take the ID, and I struggle to explain to him that the ID is broken. It's not valid.

He spends a couple minutes trying to reach his boss before going to his car and getting his passport. That was perfectly fine.

"I am (happily) no longer employed in hospitality, but during my final semester of college, I worked the front desk at a lower-end brand of a major international hotel chain. Call it the Fartyard by Warriott. The best part of that job was my lovely coworkers and manager. The worst part was being blamed by guests for legitimate issues that were entirely out of my control, such as the property being badly in need of renovations, the astronomical price of canned wine at the Market, and ""service animals"" that were clearly pets being allowed at our pet-free establishment being allowed by our GM. 



Probably the worst behaved guests I met were a couple who smoked in the room and when confronted with the evidence that they had smoked in the room, refused to pay the $250 fee. They proceeded to scream at my manager and came up with some of the most ridiculous stories I've ever heard to try and get out of paying the fee. 



""We're not smokers!!!"" I don't know or care about your personal habits and whether you consider yourself a smoker, but before you checked into the room, it was clean, and now there are cigarette ash and cigarette butts in it, and it reeks of smoke. So you owe us $250. 



""We're from out of state, we're not even from here!!!!"" All this tells me is that when you're at home, you frequent hotels and cause similar problems.



""My girlfriend doesn't even smoke, she goes to college, they drug test you at college!!!"" Most of the potheads and cig fiends I know are college students. I've never heard of drug testing at college. 



""How could we have smoked in the room, we were drinking last night! We were so drunk, we were blackout, there's no way we could have been smoking!"" ..... Sure. 


(It's true, these lovely people had showed up around 1am on a Saturday, wasted out of their minds, and had been checked in by our woefully inexperienced night auditor, who had somehow managed to only collect the room costs, not taxes and fees. The system auto-suggests room plus tax when checking in walk-ins, so I don't even know what happened there. So the taxes had to be taken out of their $100 security deposit, adding another wrinkle to an already deeply unpleasant situation.) 


My manager has an amazing poker face and kept calmly asking for the $250 despite the profanity and nonsensical excuses these people kept throwing at her. Finally, the guest paid up.


Probably the worst part of the whole ordeal was how he stuck his finger in his mouth and made sure to touch each bill with that finger before handing them to my manager.

"I’ll start off by saying I’m not Front Desk for my small 3 star hotel somewhere in the USA I’m one of 4 security folk that protect the property, the staff, and I guess to a lesser extent the guests but honestly they don’t cross paths with me as often as others just visiting for an event or out of town. 

So this happened just before Christmas on one of my back to back graveyard shifts I pull. 

Just finished giving Night Audit a quick break and was making my way back outside to my lot to post up for the next hour or so before I had to do a chore or two. 

As I’m walking down the hall I see a car drive through the lot from the windows on the doors to outside. I speed up and walk out on the patio that’s slightly elevated from the lot itself giving me a pretty good view of my entire domain.  

This car has decided to park in the darkest possible spot in the entire lot. Mind you we’re not fully booked and there’s plenty of well lit, free spots that aren’t notorious for being where shady shit goes down because there’s no lamps to illuminate the darkness by the bush line. 

So my only ‘weapon’ I have is a very large bright flashlight of justice that I won’t hesitate to shine on anyone if they’re doing something they shouldn’t be. That and a calm demeanor I can handle most things I’ve come across. I’d rather face down a rampaging homeless person than answer the phone at the desk but that’s neither here nor there. 

Anyways I light up the car from a distance hoping this would motivate them to leave as they parked and didn’t get out - another red flag that somethings going on. They’re unmoved by the light flooding their car so I keep the light trained on the drivers side window and slowly make my way to the car to make contact. 

As I get closer the driver rolls down the window and screeches at me with her hand blocking her eyes from the light. “First of all you can’t just shine that light at people! And -“ 

I cut her off. 

“Yes I can, I’m security for X hotel and subsequent property and we have closed for the night. (It was around 0200 and the bar closed at 1 so property closed to non-guests at 0130) What the hell are you doing here?” 

Admittedly my tone wasn’t the best but this wasn’t something new; the previous night I had a pickup truck with three grown men in the front cab pull into the same trouble spot and just lighting them up got rid of them. So my patience for shady shit was about at zero. 

She still blocking the light from her eyes goes “I’m waiting on a friend to check in and -“

I cut her off again. 

“No you don’t. Leave.”

Visible confusion as she attempts to repeat the lie to me. 

“No my friend hasn’t checked in yet I’m just waiting for them to get here -“

I cut her off again. 

“No you don’t. There’s no one checking in. You need to leave now. Property is closed.”

She starts to sputter and protest and I remain resolute. After hours it’s just me and Night Audit and if we’re being technical I’m the highest ranking person on property at the time even if I’m just a scurity grunt 98% with no “managerial” authority. 

So she tries to pull a classic Karen move on me. 

“You’ll get in trouble for this. (Uh huh, doing my job, you’re being shady, ok buddy) what’s your supervisors name?!”

Calmly as I turned my back on her and walked back toward the patio I just say “No.” 

I kill the patio lights and position myself just past the bushes that block the patio from being wide open to the parking lot and wait. She creeps by looking for me to I assume get that last word in but can’t find me so she leaves. 

Her story didn’t add up, her behavior didn’t match her story and ultimately she was removed and never seen again. 

Sorry for the long post but I really wanted to share my story.

"So I have worked at a shitty motel for almost 2 years now. The manager has always been a nightmare, but being handicapped, it is difficult for me to find other employment. I have finally found 2 jobs I can do to replace this one. I graduated college so I'm still applying for jobs in my field.

These are just a few examples, but since I started there my manager has...

1. Treated employees she didn't like badly enough that they would quit because firing someone takes too much paperwork.

2. Been openly and subtly racist.

3. Told employees to clock out and keep working if they didn't get everything done within their shift. 

4. Allowed employees she likes to be openly racist and refuse guests due to their name and how they look.

5. When my father-in-law passed away suddenly, she texted me at least once a day while I was gone to tell me how *inconvenient* it was that I wasn't at work. 

6. One coworker worked here for several *years*. When she put in her two week notice, the manager talked shit about her daily. Not only that, but the manager told her not to come in for her last 4 days *AND THEN TOLD OTHER EMPLOYEES AND GUESTS THAT SHE JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR HER SHIFTS*. She also told me that she would specifically give that employee a bad reference when future employers called her. It's a right to work state; that employee wasn't even *required* to give notice. She could have just quit and left. (Yes, I warned that employee about what the manager said).

7. She has left managerial tasks for me to do and, (being in a position where I couldn't afford to lose my job), I did them even though I'm paid way too little.

8. Allowed the maintenance guy to be verbally abusive to employees because ""I can't replace him. Nobody else knows as much about pools as him."" Yes. That is a quote. 

9. Allowed employees to make massive mistakes and then let them leave those mistakes for me to fix. Usually, all it takes is a quick chat with tech support, but those employees refuse to fix their own mistakes and the manager allows it.

10. There is nonstop gossip and drama. The manager talks about EVERY employee behind their back, nearly all of it lies. And she encourages gossip and drama between employees.

11. She shares personal information about employees with regular guests and gossips about *everything and everyone*.

12. She tries to dictate people's lives *outside of work*. She told one employee *when* she was *allowed* to have her hip replacement surgery. After bitching the WHOLE time while that employee was gone for surgery, she then told that employee that she was NEVER *allowing* her to have surgery again. 

12B. Along with that, she tells people not to leave town on their days off if *she* is out of town just in case anything happens.

12C. *She* left town when there was only 3 people able to work the front desk and then rolled her car. *Inconvenient, I know*

13. When one employee was out for surgery, another employee scheduled *her* surgery at the same time. That left 1 front desk employee (me) and 2 housekeepers who *kinda* know how to work front desk.

13B. I was hired for part time (because I'm handicapped) and yet instead of picking up some slack herself because she *chose* not to hire anyone in the interim, I was scheduled 7 days in a row since 2 employees were out for surgery. But no overtime, because she specifically scheduled it so that 3 days were on one week and the other 4 were on another week.

14. We get paid physical checks that we have to pick up at the front desk at noon on payday (Fridays). *Everyone's is available.* Unless that person got fired or quit. In THAT case, their check is locked in a safe that only my manager can get into. That way, the person is forced to talk to her. She withholds paychecks to be petty. If that person comes to get their check after she's gone for the day, they have to wait until Monday to get paid. That is highly illegal and I have TOLD people that, but they're too scared of my manager to do anything about it.

NOW. I tried for 3 days to come in when she was here to give my 2 week notice because I *knew* that if I just left a note or email, she would talk shit about how I was ""too chicken"" to quit to her face. But every time I came, she was gone. I finally got fed up and left a note. And an email, for proof that I DID give notice.

That was yesterday. My manager is already spreading lies about how I gave notice and what I said *in* my notice. The note and the email said mostly the exact same thing. 

""*******,

As you know, I came in today to give you my notice. January 31st, 2020 is my last day of work at the ***** *. Along with my verbal notice, I wanted to provide written notice as well.

Regards.""


There are 5 more days that I'll be working in my last 2 weeks. She's going to do her best to make my life a living hell...and who knows what she'll do after that.

What would you do in my shoes?Monster Manager. I quit.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This happened a while back at the first hotel I worked at.

Because of a burst water pipe in the outside part of the building, the hotel was experiencing a complete lack of water.

To make things worse, our general manager was out of town that day, and for whatever reason he was not able to arrange for the burst pipe to be fixed in a timely manner.

I had to relocate most of our guests, listen to infinite complaints, apologise a million times, make quite a few refunds and had to face many angry guests shouting and cursing at me, or asking me for some form of compensation.

It definitely was a hell of a day.

So this just got me wondering, what's the worst you've had to deal with while working at the front desk? 

What's the one day or shift you could look back to and hope you'll never have to go through something like that again?What's the worst crisis you've had to deal with?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"So this review came in when I asked a guest to leave the pool area 45 minutes after it was supposed to be closed:

""Rude intoxicated pervert night staff at this location! I checked in late at 10pm. I was told by the nice evening female staff that I can go in the hot tub later than usual. The male night staff OP rudely asked me to get out of the hot tub, 15 minutes after I entered at 10:30. The staff watched as I dressed. I asked for privacy he rolled his eyes and walked away. I said to the staff as I walked passed him ""you could have manners and give guests privacy! we pay for, its perverted to wath guests get dressed"". The staff yelled at me calling me a pervert. I said he is the one watching me get dressed. He threatened to have me kicked out of the hotel. My girlfriend watched horrified that paying guests are treated this way. I walked away because he was obviously intoxicated and behaving irate. Beware intoxicated pervert night staff OP at this location! I will never stay at this hotel again. I was so close to calling the police.""

I mean if you are upset for being kicked out of the pool 45 minutes after it should have been locked (and he was in there before it was supposed to be closed) and want to get somebody in trouble, you should not embellish like this.

I just shake my head.This guest review just came in. (Fuck I hate people)",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"*I originally posted this as a comment, but I figured it deserved its own slot since some of the details started coming back to me beyond the comment thread.*

Football weekends can be literal hell. The endless string of guests checking into the hotel, the constant requests, and the hordes of people lingering in the lobby can make a shift tough, especially if you’re a college student like me who studies during down time.

Back during football season, my big-ten college was playing a NCAA Division 1 game and the following Sunday, you’d have thought there was this mass exodus from the ”premier” Schmoliday Out downtown. Well, most people checked out and were totally okay with their stays. Then there’s the Karen.

This Karen came to the desk, checked out, and when asked about her stay, she said it was great and left. This little detail comes into play about ten minutes later when the phone rings.

I picked up the phone once it started beeping and did the standard greeting. Then:

K: Is there a manager I can talk to? Our entire stay was just awful.

M *\*recognizing the voice on the other end of the line as the woman I’d checked out ten minutes before\**: Is this &lt;insert Karen’s name here&gt;?

K: Yes...

M: I’m the one who checked you out and you said your stay was fine.

K: Well, our room wasn’t cleaned either day and we never got soap for the shower. The pool was simply too cold and the breakfast was inedible. You call this a hotel? This is purely unacceptable for a &lt;corporation name&gt; brand and—

M *\*seeing her little scheme for what it was and looking at the notes for her room. Spoiler: two DND signs\**: Did you ever inform the front desk of your concerns? And from what housekeeping tells me, you had the Do Not Disturb sign out both days, which is why they didn’t clean the room.

K: Well... no, we didn’t tell them. We didn’t want to make a fuss. But because of the horrid experience, we feel we deserve a full refund, and I’ll accept nothing less than that.

*Two things: one, in aviation, every aircraft has a pilot in command, and their job is to not cave to bullshit. I’d been pilot in command of planes for about two years before this, so my tolerance for bullshit is extremely low; I can usually manage to hide it for the hotel, but sometimes it makes an appearance. Two, before this phone call, I’d had a snowflake bitch me out for not giving him free breakfast even though he was the highest level of snowflake there was in my brand, even though my hotel doesn’t do free breakfast unless you pay for it with your rate. As such, my patience was just about as nonexistent as it could be. It takes a lot to get to me, but entitlement and lying are the two big ones. Put these two and my aviation training together, and you get something like this:*

M: You’ll have to. You never told us about your issues, you left the Do Not Disturb sign up both days, and you apparently lied and told me your stay was great. We can’t read minds. It was your responsibility to tell us of any issues with your stay, which you failed to do. As such, we will not be compensating.

*At this point, Karen realized her little scheme wasn’t going to work. She’d simply gotten the one desk agent who doesn’t cave to bullshit, and she didn’t like this too much. Cue the Karenisms.*

K: What’s the number for Corporate? I can’t believe how unprofessional you’re being. I’m going to make sure they hear of your conduct and they’re going to fire you. What’s your name?

M: My name’s airbusman. Have a good day.

K: WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBER FOR— *\*click\**

She tried to call back, but unfortunately for her, she got my former manager, who had even less patience for crap than I did. He just hung up on her.

Most of my stories have an ending similar to this one, but they’re very few and far between. Usually people at least voice their complaints. Rarely at my location do people not. But when they try to pull this crap, it winds up here.One way or another, Karen, you’re a liar.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I've got a new story to tell.

So I arrive at work a little before Midnight, count the float, settle in, etc.  I then realize that I need to take a shit.  As I'm doing so, I can hear someone trying to open the locked door to the front office.  (Its a small building, more of a two bedroom house with a Front Desk instead of a porch).  Despite realizing its locked, this person tries again and again.  Who knows, maybe it'll magically open the sixth time?

I hurry up and get out there, and see a middle aged lady wearing a grey nightgown and no shoes.  While its warmed up in my province, its still below 0c and at night.  Once inside the office, she asks me if I enjoy the sound of people having sex, and I can tell she's annoyed.  She also smells like a goddamn brewery.  I say no, and then she launches into an rant about how she pays to be here, they don't (she thinks they're on welfare and she shouldn't have to pay taxes to hear fuckin'), and that we've had to warn this room once already (boss never said anything during the shift change about a problem room), and that she's been here for 30 days (23 actually) and she shouldn't have to deal with this noise.

I say that I'll try to figure out which room it is and tell them to keep it down, but if its not above a certain threshold there's not really much I or the cops can do.  So I go outside, press my ear to the two doors above her, and while I can hear the TV and some people chatting in one room (nothing in the other) I don't hear wild monkey sex.  So I tell her that sorry, there's nothing I can legally do.  If I can't hear it, then its an acceptable noise level.  People are allowed to fuck in their rooms.  (Funnily enough, she never asked for a room change, and we're pretty open.  if there were problems already, it seems like that would have been my boss's first go to)

She does not take this well, to the point where her screams in the parking lot are resulting in noise complaints from other rooms.  She bangs hard on my locked door for a solid five minutes, and then starts throwing the snowballs at my manager's suite above the FD to try and wake him up (and he's just worked a 16hr shift, I'ma let him sleep).  This doesn't work, so she returns to her room.

I call the cops, they get here pretty much immediately.  They go talk to her, and she starts screaming at them.  When they come back, they basically tell me that ""yeah, she's completely unreasonable.  if you need us to evict her call us back.""  It seems like she might have at least realized that she doesn't have any leverage here and has so far stayed quiet. (but I am of course, going to be fired because she spends $600 a week to stay here, and I rolled my eyes once)

Oof.Drunk Karen does not like people fuckin' in her vicinity",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Lol nope! 

Its not our responsibility or job to let you know which guests aren’t allowed here and for what reasons.  You should know or have better judgment on who you let in your room.

"This one's short but I found it too amusing to not share! I was working a 3-11 last week and the restaurant and bar close in the hotel early on Sundays in the winter because it's so quiet. So around 9:30, this girl and her friend (a big bulky guy) come out of the hotel. He must be the DD, because he's stone cold sober, but she's clearly been having a good time. As they walk for the door, I say ""Have a good night!""

She waves as she walks past the desk. ""Heyyy hot guy!"" She stops, then looks at me. ""You're hot!""

Me: ""Well thank you, that's very nice of you!""

After a long pause, she staggers over to the desk. ""So um... do you... have a girlfriend?""

Me: ""No I do not!""

Girl: \*eyes lighting up\* ""Oooooh! Well hey, I don't have a boyfriend!""

Me: \*grinning ear to ear\* ""I do!""

Cue the most hilarious five or six seconds of the week as she attempts to process the words I just said. You could almost see the ""ERROR"" message flashing in her brain. Finally, it clicks.

Girl: ""Ohhhhh! Oh I'm... oops... I hope you and him are happy!""

Me: ""We are, thanks!""

She staggers out of the hotel and her friend sighs and laughs. ""Pay her no mind, have a good one man!""

"So I just had a very confusing moment just now when I got off the phone.   


Last twenty minutes of my shift, just browsing a little bit of reddit in the back while I wait for time to tick down. Phone goes off:  


Me: Thank you for calling ""hotel in big star state""! This is Duelingpokemon, how may I help you this evening?  


Out of Hotel guest: Yeah, Im currently at your hotel in ""some other area close by"" and Ive been standing here for about twenty minutes. There's no one at the desk and Ive tried to call the phone about twenty times now. Im wondering what I should do next?  


Me: (-insert very confused wtf expression-) Um....Is there a sign at the front desk, ma'am?  


OoH: Lemme see (I hear the phone go off in the background) nope, don't see one and there goes the phone again.   


Me: Um well.....I'm not sure how I can assist you with this, ma'am. Im currently at another location....  


OoH: Well yeah, but aren't you guys owned by the same company? Are they franchised out?   


Me: -insert another wtf face- Ma'am, I know that our hotel is franchised but Im not sure of the location of where you're at. (She was at our sister location about 15 minutes away) It's likely the agent may have stepped away for something so they should return.  


OoH: Well what do you suggest I do?  


Me: Ma'am, again, there's little I can do.   


It continues for a bit and she hangs up on me with the air of ""Well, you're not very helpful"" coming through the line. This just leaves this tired little FDA very horrifically confused.

"This happened years ago.  I was 23 and working for a large, prestigious law firm.  I had to fly with a senior partner and the general counsel who was our client to another city for a case.  These are two older men who both have a large paycheck and have the attitude that can come with it.  Before we leave for the airport, the secretary that made the hotel arrangements told both of them ""tonight there is no suite available but you will have a suite tomorrow and for the rest of your stay"".  She told them this more than once.

We get to the hotel.  Guess who stands at the front desk demanding a suite and making a scene?  I just stood to the side looking horrified waiting for my room key.  They finally got rooms with an adjoining door for that one night.  Then they fussed about it in the elevator.  I told his secretary when we got back and she wasn't surprised.  She said she knew they would do that.    I just don't get how people can act that way.

"(These are 3 different stories, which is why the post is inhumanly long)

Yesterday I posted a story about a guest clearly abusing our shuttle so it got me thinking of some interactions I've had with guests taking advantage of the FREE service we provide 

For context, we provide a shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel available to any registered guest. The front desk team takes turns doing them when it's not busy enough to have a dedicated driver staffed. 

**Guest gets angry that other guests are allowed to use the shuttle**:
Theres a lot of major corporate offices around us so around 6pm when everyone's getting off work, the shuttle is incredibly busy. One night, I had 5 different stops to make. The first man I picked up got in the van and I told him we had a couple other stops. First thing he does is say ""No, I have dinner plans and need to get back to the hotel"". I apologized and told him the *free* service is available to everyone and they all also had reasons to need to get back to the hotel. He didn't like this answer and said as an *elite* member, he should be treated differently.

Theres so many things I wanted to say; like we don't have a dedicated *elite member shuttle* so he'll have to ride with all the peasants, or if he was really in such a hurry, he could have just paid $6 for the short uber ride back to the hotel, or he could have charted a private helicopter to get him around the city for all I cared. Of course, I didnt say any of that, we didnt talk at all after I told him I had to pick everyone else up first.

When we finally got back, he just threw the door open before I could even get around to open it for him and stormed inside. Obviously, he mentioned in his online review that his ""elite status has never been so disrespected"". Entitled douchebag.

**Guest gets angry that 50,000 other people are going to the same destination he is**:
Similar to the previous one. We're near a major sports stadium that holds almost 50,000 people so needless to say, the shuttle is VERY busy on game days. One family came down and asked for the shuttle. I told the father traffic was a disaster and the van was already out taking another group so the wait time might be upwards of 20 minutes. Hes immediately pissed off but doesnt say anything at this point. After about 10 minutes, he comes back and says ""You said itd be 20 minutes and it's not back yet"". I told itd had only been 10 minutes. He just turned around and went back to his family.

The van finally comes back and a larger crowd had amassed at this point. I make sure the man's family is the first one to get on and once everyone else is loaded, they're off. Later I get a call from the same man furious that we didnt drop him off directly at the stadium. (Traffic gets really bad so we have to drop them off at a designated hotel drop-off that's about a 1/3 mile walk. It could take almost half an hour to get them directly in to the stadium). He says I never told him this (which I did) and that he felt his family shouldnt have had to cram in to a packed van when they asked first. I didnt know what to say so once he noticed the conversation wasnt going anywhere, he just hung up. Another entitled douche too cheap to pay $10 for a private ride.

**Guest tries to use it as her personal chauffeur**: 
A woman one night called from the mall (about a mile from the hotel) and asked if we could come take her to dinner (a restaurant a couple miles down the road from the mall, further away from the hotel). When I tell her service is only to and from the hotel, she sighs and says ""So what, are you telling me I need to walk 2 miles to dinner?"" I tell her that its laid out very clearly to them when we drop them off that service is only to and from our hotel, so she needs to find her own transportation to any other destination. Then she says ""well then, you can pick me up from the mall, drive back to the hotel *if you must*, and then take me right back out to dinner"". I tell her that's not something I can do because it's clearly an abuse of the *free* service and ties the shuttle up from other guests who may need it. She just sighs again, louder this time, and says ""FINE, just take me back to the hotel if you really want to be this difficult"".

I knew right away what was going to happen. As soon as we got back to the hotel, she doesn't even get out of the van and says ""good, now take me to the restaurant"". I told her that we had already discussed this and I'm not able to do that. Of course she says that she is a guest physically at the property, requesting a shuttle to a local business as its meant to be provided. She wasn't technically wrong but the way she connived her way to winning was just really slimy in my opinion. Its clearly an abuse of the service. I reluctantly took her back out.

Then the next day, I hear from my coworker that the same woman wanted him to take her to a gas station, wait for her to come out, then take her to a chinese restaurant, wait AGAIN, and then drop her off at the mall. He was more resilient than I was so he refused to let her pull the same trick she did the night before so he took her to the chinese restaurant and back to the hotel, of course with her complaining the whole way

(Some of you may not understand why it's such a big deal but once we open the door for guests to be able to use it to get from anywhere to anywhere, it becomes chaos.)

"Sorry for any formatting, I’m on mobile. I work front desk/concierge at a luxury hotel in a small city that generally attracts a lot of wealthy travelers. We regularly host golf events, media conferences, etc. So, one weekend, our manager tells us we have a big fish coming in, so be on your best behavior. 

He then showed us the man’s net worth, which topped out closer to 3 billion than not. I was interested. I’ve never met or even seen a multi-billionaire. I was then very surprised to see that he was in a main floor basic king room, with a custom rate. Halfway through his stay, he asked about his room rate, shook his head, and had us move him to an even lower class of room to save some money. Of course, we accommodated him, and gave him a custom rate that even our long time guests rarely see. 

After he had haggled and bitched about the cost, I looked his wealth source up and it was from subprime loans and gouging student loan payments. If the other staff had known, which is almost all local college folks, he probably would have gotten the worst service in the place. Money talks, but he wasn’t tipping, and half of them have loans that he probably had his dirty hands in.

"A guests checks out this morning and tells me he had an awful nights sleep because the smoke detector was beeping all night long. 

Of course, this prompted me to ask if he had called the front desk to let us know. 

Him:”No it was late and I didn’t want to make a scene by causing issues.” 

Me: “I’m very sorry about that, had we been informed we would have taken care of this issue for you last night.”

Him: “I didn’t want you to think I was expecting anything special from you all.” 

I apologized again and said we would get that taken care of today. 

Him: “Do I get any special compensation?” 

Me: “Had we known we would have gladly moved you and given you a free upgrade for your troubles. Anything further I will have to contact the owner.” 

Him: “I say go ahead and do that our company stays here all the time.” 

Then he left all disgruntled.

So he doesn’t want any special treatment but also wants special treatment.

"Our hotel provides a shuttle to nearby businesses. The three front desk agents take turns doing them until it stops running at 11.

A couple nights ago, someone came up and asked me if he could use the shuttle. I tell him yes but I needed an address first to make sure his destination is within range. He says it's a hotel by the stadium but he doesn't know which one. I tell him I can't take him over there without an address because there's over 20 hotels within 5 miles of here so it could be any one of those. He's clearly frustrated that I'm ""pestering"" him for an address. He keeps insisting that I just take him to the one closest to the stadium, which I tell him could be one of 5 or 6 different hotels.

He finally gets the name of the hotel from his friend (just the name, not the address). To which I tell him there's two of those within a couple miles of here so I still need an address. He then goes off about how difficult I'm being and if I didn't want to take him so bad, I should just pay for his cab.

So I finally get annoyed and agree to take him to the ""closest *frampton inn* in to the stadium"". He just scoffs and follows me outside. I drop him off and not 5 minutes later, I get a call from him. He's immediately screaming about how *I* dropped him off at the wrong hotel. That I ""should know the area better"". He was demanding that I come back to the wrong hotel and take him to the right one. Funniest part is, he finally called his friend and got the address. The right hotel ISN'T EVEN AT THE STADIUM. It's a quarter mile from it. 

It was very satisfying to tell him that service is only to and from the hotel so if he needed to go anywhere else, he would have to make other arrangements. Of course he tried to say it was my fault so I needed to provide the shuttle to compensate for *my* mistake. I just told him that I took him exactly where he asked and, as I wasn't provided an address, I couldn't have known the correct location. He just slammed the phone and I never heard from him again.

Disclaimer: I know from a customer service perspective, I didn't handle this appropriately. I probably should've just gone back to get him (which really is against the rules but had I ran it by management, they probably would've been ok with the exception).

"I'm about to check in a guest who complained to our corporate HQ that he is always asked for ID when he checks in despite being a regular guest here.

Now that is true, he is a regular guest here, but he is so not memorable that we do ask for ID.  He is very plain, and what is remembered about him is that he is very dour, doesn't want to wait for our spiel about the amenities, and overall impolite.  I think I saw him one morning after checking him in the night before, and said ""Good Morning!""; it was unremarkable to say the least...it's like he doesn't want to be bothered, addressed, or even acknowledge.

So, imagine our surprise when he complained about being *acknowledge*.  When he comes in he practically whisper mumbles his name, and if you ask him to repeat it, he says it extra loud.  He's just has an unnecessary rudeness about him; it's literally for no reason.

So, now I'm waiting for him to come in -- we have comped him a suite for his stay, and have a gift bag waiting for him.  A gift bag that he will probably snatch out of my hands and walk away without saying even ""thanks"".

Can't wait. \*hellified eye roll\*

UPDATE:  Guest checked in 1/2 hour ago, spat out his name as he walked in, and went straight to our market.  I told him that ""we have been expecting you"", and that I have his keys already made, then I presented his gift bag to him.  He actually did say, ""thank you"" as he received it, then said, ""good night.""  

My take away from this is that we all want to be recognized and acknowledge, but if we put off vibes that say otherwise, then the opposite will happen.

"It had been a silent night and my blood pressure was alright.

This normallooking couple in their fourties comes to the front desk to check out. They give me the room number after me smiling them welcome. I ask if they had a pleasant stay and expected the regular respond. Stupid me.

""No! We couldn't sleep at all! Someone in the room next door beated up a women all night. We did not a second of sleep because of the screaming and bouncing...""

My smile froze and my mind went back to every second of the nightshift in an attempte to remember the missed call. We did not have a lot of queues during the shift and I could not recall any missed calls so I asked when they did the call to the front desk regarding this.

""No we did never call the front desk... but we could not sleep, it was horrendous!"" they said.

I stared at them. "" When did you call the police then?"" I asked while I searched for who else stayed in the same part of the hotel. It was just them and an other couple checked in the same corridor because we had a low occupancy. The other couple had already left at the express checkout without the staff ever see them leaving.

""We did not call the police! It was the worst hotelstay ever... we could hear the screams all night!"" 

I realized then that my faith in mindkind was over. I am not sure if I excused myself or if I just left them hanging there at the front desk but I went back office asked my manager to handle them because I could not do it. I told her the short story and she made the check out. 

I ended my shift earlier that day. I remember that I asked my manager if we could blacklist guest just being bad humans but I am not sure what happened with that.

Edit: Sorry I should have noted this already when I posted it from the beginning. The guests had left the room in a mess. It was blood in the room and some of the interior was broken. So the summary was that the lowlife scumbags listen to another lowlife scumbag hitting his partner without lifting a fucking finger. Litterly did not lift a finger to press a button to maybe save someone's life. 

This still makes me sick... It has been a while now. But it makes me fucking angry just thinking about it.The one guests that I could not check out.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"All my colleagues decided to direct the French customers to me whenever they had a complaint. I noticed they were always annoyed and sometimes it is our fault, sometimes not. 

Here’s one case that stood out for how entitled the French guy was. 

He had 5 rooms, in a “grand villa” style where technically it’s 5 separate rooms but arranged together to form a huge room with a courtyard, two pools and sunbathing area.

That day, we were thinking he wanted to pay for the other half of the rooms which wasnt paid for yet. 

He comes to reception, pissed off, and shoving his phone in my face saying “THERE ARE WORMS IN MY ROOM AND YOU SAID 15 MINUTES AGO YOU WILL BE THERE NO HOUSEKEEPING HAS BEEN THERE YET!” 

Trying my best to make sure we’re not at fault, I respond, “Sir, those are termites. They exist naturally and it’s literally a never ending war between us and them. You notice how most of the hotel is now plastic and painted steel? That’s because we had to replace the wood with those materials. *Theres only one housekeeper working the evening shift after 5pm* so he has a lot of work on his hands, but I’ll go to your room to check it for you.”

Oh, fuck. Now it becomes my problem.

The French guy’s mum has asked the housekeeper to fumigate the room, not knowing that, obviously, poison is used in the mix. So now it becomes my problem. 

The thing that gets me is he makes a big fuss about every little detail like “Wow you don’t clean your room and what happens for two weeks?” When we sometimes leave rooms checked however unclean because we are short on manpower, and there are other rooms which need to be cleaned as this room will be vacant for 2 weeks. 

Then I get to the process of his aforementioned payment.

As I did not know if he wanted to pay tonight, I didn’t prepare his invoice. This took 5 minutes however with him breathing his sighs at me, fussing, insulting,  groaning and acting like a toddler not getting their toy. He said things like “oh because it is you it is slow.” 

SOP for invoices at check out is the night Audit will print out all invoices for us since he has the entire night to do so, and morning shift simply takes the complete invoices and shows them to the customer when they check out.

He was pretty arrogant in trying to show that he had a Thai Airways Platinum Amex card, which I had to see the benefits of afterwards, turns out it has an insane interest rate. So I feel happy that he had his money taken away. 

He once again said “Can I get any compensation for the termites?”

I honestly fucking lost my cool at this point. “RESPECTFULLY SIR, AS. I. SAID. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF MOTHER NATURE (then realising I raised my voice at the prick) and for us it is a never ending war between them. The fumigation is an unforgivable mistake however your mother was the person who asked to start the fumigation. This was verbally confirmed and therefore we are not fully responsible. We will not compensate for the actions of Mother Nature.” 

Tbh at this point I think something inside him realise he was being a total dick to me. 

He lowered his voice, and changed his tone to a soft one. 

I then decided why not give him one cocktail per over 18 in his group? So I asked him how many over 18s were travelling with him and gave him that many cocktail vouchers. 

I still haven’t seen him write a review on any OTA site and I hope he doesn’t because I know he’s definitely going to make a mountain out of a termite hill. 

Question for other redditors: are French people normally like this or is this guy an especially big dick?Are French people generally rude or did I just meet a big AH?",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"It’s pretty standard for us two give two room keys to everyone that checks in. We will give additional if they ask for more. I get kinda annoyed when they say, “just one key please.” It’s like they are sacrificing or “trying to make it easier” for us. It takes two seconds to make a key and majority of the time I’ve already processed and halfway making the keys when they ask....

"Obligatory ""I'm on mobile yadda yadda""

I'm the front desk manager in a 120 room Schmoliday Out in Connecticut and our hotel isn't in the best area, and we have problems with the occasional homeless person or crackhead coming in and loitering. But this guy, let's call him John, I've been dealing with all week. Earlier this week, a friend booked a room for him, and he completely trashed it. Smoked, left trash everywhere, broke a dresser drawer, the whole 9 yards. He would come in, just sit in the lobby, and make weird noises and bang stuff around until someone chased him out. Saturday, he snuck in, found a room that was propped open, and made himself at home (and trashed the room again). I was in the back office working and went up with my FDA to kick him out, and we thought he was gone for good.

That brings us to today. I stopped to grab a coffee before work (I'm working 3pm-7am today, being short staffed is great), and I'm sitting in my car for a few minutes before my shift. We have a front desk group chat, and my FDA says John is wandering the hallways, harassing housekeepers, and asking guests for money. He's not a registered guest and she has no idea what room he's in, but she called the police.

That's my cue to go in take care of things.

I walk in, set my purse down, and ask the front desk what's going on, when we hear the elevator ding. Out steps John. 

Me: John, you need to go.

J: I'm just going out to grab some food

Me: No, you need to leave

J: Ok, fine, just let me pack my things

Me: Ok. I'm going up with you
(I've dealt with him enough times to know he won't leave unless you're there to watch him)

We get in the elevator, and I message the front desk to let her know what room he's in. I stand there for 5 minutes while he packs his things. The housekeeper supervisor joins me in case I need back up, and we ride the elevator down to make sure he gets out.

20 minutes later, the cops finally get here. I let them know I've already taken care of it, and the cop jokes about us switching jobs for the night. Hopefully that's the last I see of him, because I'll be here all night, and I'm not in the mood to deal with it today.

Tl;dr: crazy local keeps sneaking into rooms and trashing them, cops called, I took care of it before they even got here

Update: My shift is over in 8 minutes. I haven't seen him all night, but tomorrow is another day. Thanks for keeping me entertained, everyone! I'm going to get some sleep15 hours and 45 minutes of my shift remaining and I've already had to kick someone out",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"This happened a couple days ago, and reminds me that, although the Night Audit shift is generally pretty chill, sometimes things can go horrifically wrong through no fault of your own.

Partway through Friday night, I got a guy at the front desk, asking for a key to his room. He gave the correct room number and name on the reservation, so I gave him a card. He came back down, telling me his door was bolted shut and asking me to call the room. I did so, only for the person in the room to answer and hang up after a couple rings. I tried calling again, but no answer.

So, for the past week we had this stock show in town, and there were people from all over there. The group this guest and the others in his room were a part of was a team of judges or something from Minnesota, and they were planning on leaving the next day. I’m not sure how old they were, but I’m guessing late teens, early twenties, and a few of them went out that night and it sounds like the girls got a little drunk, shut the door, deadbolted it and passed out, leaving the guy out to dry, apparently.

Unfortunately, I had no way of getting in the deadbolted room and neither did my security guy, so there wasn’t much we could do. The guy that needed to get in there didn’t ask us for help for a while after that and I’m not sure where he went. One of the other rooms, perhaps?

However, like I said, the group was planning on leaving. The coach came down, checked out, and the rest of the group started coming down. Unfortunately, there was no sign of the girls from the deadbolted room. The coach went up there, couldn’t get in and got no response from the girls. I got notified and then continued to try and get ahold of the room, to no avail. I even basically tried calling the room, hanging it up and redialing several times without putting the receiver down, but still got no answer. It seemed the girls were out cold.

After that, we kept trying to get into the room somehow. I call my GM, he doesn’t have a way in (supposedly). I tried getting a hold of maintenance. They didn’t have a way. I got into contact with some of the housekeepers. There’s apparently a key to get in those kinds of doors, but it was in the housekeeping office, which, of course, was locked with no way to get in.

The team was supposed to leave at 5am. I got off at 7am and they were still there. There was nothing I could do other than notify the girl who came in after me and sympathize with the coach. After I apologized, he assured me that it wasn’t our fault. Once I jokingly asked if he wanted to just leave them behind and he said he was considering just making sure they were okay and then leaving them to find their own way back home. I guess that meant they were all at least eighteen.

I wasn’t there for the resolution, but I did hear from my security guy and the GM that apparently the girls ended up finally waking up. I’m not sure how long that took, though. Hopefully not too long.

At least the coach was cool about it. The GM also assured me there wasn’t really anything I could have done when I saw him after starting my next shift.

Moral of the story for kids on any sort of team: don’t get drunk and pass out just a couple hours before you’re supposed to leave and definitely don’t deadbolt your door or silence your room’s phone. Your coaches and fellow students will hate you.

TL, DR: Team leaves hours late after a couple girls on it pass out drunk and deadbolt their room.The time a team was kept from leaving because of a deadbolt",TalesFromTheFrontDesk

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday after my post, for the first night nothing happened. Not until 6:45am This morning (sunday) when a guy left the property from the room. As he was leaving I could see that he was high as a kite. Unfortunately I still wasn't able to do much as the proof I needed to get the guest out wasn't quite there yet. And again, We would have to jump through hoops with this insurance company.

Fast Forward to 10:39pm tonight just as the last shift was leaving out the back door. This guest came down to the front and took yet another guy up to the room. At 12:13am they left in his car. Well, 12:43 he walks in the back with a whole new person and luckily this new person screwed up.

As they were walking toward the elevator I heard him say ""Oh yeah man, I'm ready for that smoke and swirl."" just as the elevator door closed. Was that enough proof? For me yes, but, I needed more, so I decided to do something shady as hell.

I was pretty sure this was a gay, meth head situation so I decided to call my neighbor and ask him what gay apps he uses to hook up. I downloaded Grindr on his advice and set up a profile. putting the words ""Smouke and Swerl"" in order for it not to be blocked.

Within a minute this dude hit me up and asked me to come join him in his room for some drugs and sex.

THERE WAS MY PROOF.

I message him back and told him that now that I have the proof I need, Insurance or not, that if one more crack head comes to his room we will be calling Chicago PD, the dude he had just taken up immediately came down and left through the front door like a bat out of hell.

Now, I just have to show this proof to my acting manager in the morning and hopefully something can be done about this crack head.

If we can't get him out, we can at least make him stop bringing people in for the safety of the other guests.The Mystery of the potential crack heads (DEFINITELY A CRACK HEAD) Part 2",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hello, boys! I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Tonight was supposed to be a quiet night at my little Schmoliday Out. I've been spending most of my night either Redditing or studying... okay, mostly Redditing. Most of my guests had been checked in, and I was just lounging behind the desk, when...

*BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP! A fire emergency has been detected in the building...*

Yep. The fire alarms went off. Now, my first reaction was to call the fire department, then my manager, so that's exactly what I did. Meanwhile, my aviation training kicked in for what're called in the industry ""memory items,"" one of which is to call for help, so the first thing I did was call 911 to report it. After that, I called my manager and told him about it, and about the same time, the kitchen called to say it was just a false alarm. However, by then the trucks were already rolling. So I had our maintenance guy go silence the alarm. When all was said and done, two police officers and eight or nine firefighters entered the hotel and secured it before leaving five minutes later. In total, the whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. And that's how my first fire alarm went. I'm just surprised it took this long to do it, since I've been working here for about seven months.Well, it finally happened",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I run a small hotel with a hand-operated elevator that only the staff can use. I take a drunk couple up and this guy won't stop talking about how hot his wife is. Admittedly, she is quite attractive and they are hanging on each other. He's a gruff, average joe type dude with a trucker hat and a scruffy beard. As I stop on their floor and let them out he gives me a whole speech:    

Drunk Husband:  ""Look how hot my wife is. She's 35 and she is so hot. And she does great stuff for me too. She wakes up before me every morning and does her sexy little stripper walk to the bathroom and then she has a coffee and breakfast waiting for me every morning.

"So a few month ago I had a guest call me asking for the price on a double room for a week. He then adds he wants room 424 which is a superior room, Which I inform him of and give him the price for the whole week. He then thanks me and tell me he will call back when he talked to his wife.   


A couple hours later a booking from a third party comes in to our system. I know it´s him since it is the same dates he asked me about. This booking is for a double room and ha have written that he would like to get room 424. I send him an email saying yet again 424 is a superior room and if he now wants it he need to pay for an upgrade, $20 per night. He says he have stayed with us before and only wants to pay $10 per night for the upgrade.   
By now I'm just so fed up with him. Trying to get a better price when he now booked thru a third party that takes a 15% commission. Since I don't want to be rude I just tell him I can't give that price to him that I need to take it up with my GM and I can give him the upgrade when I have gotten okey from my GM. He just tells me to book him there right away and we will figure out the price later.   
My GM says no and especially since he did the booking the way he did.   


A few weeks go by and it's time for arrival. It's my colleague  who check him in so I only know this part from what I read in his reservation. When my  colleague tried to get him to pay for the upgrade he insisted that he wanted to talk to the GM about the price. This was on a weekend so she wasen't at work and my  colleague said he could come by on monday. But he never did... But what he did during his entire stay was complain that the room was cold and there was flies that had come in to the room when he opend the window... He complained when we got a power outage (not the hotels fault) and he complaind the water was to slow and cold in the shower. everything at our hotell was wrong. He didn't want a extra heater or have our janitor take a look at the shower. With every complaint he did he said he wanted a discount on his room.

On his last night here my colleague found that he had stayed one time with us before in the same room and that he complaind just like this time that the room was cold and water was slow. We had given him a discount of $20 that time.  


The day of check out I'm the one working. I really didn't want to deal with him becuse I knew he would be a pain. He walked past me for breakfast and asked if it was possible to extend their stay one more day if they could change their ferry ticket.  I said it was possible and just to let me know.    
Five minutes to check out he came down. Super angry that they didn't let him rebook his ferry ticket since it was non refundable complaining that he spends thousands here every year and they should be treating him with more respect.   
When he was done he said he wanted to check out and I gave him the total for the upgrade and he looked at me.   
\-Is this really accurate?   
\-Yes Sir, I haven't heard otherwise... (I'm now getting ready to be yelled at)  
\-Well okay then.   


He then just payed and leaves...... Nothing happend!

"Greetings fellow soldiers on the front lines of hospitality!

I work in a backpackers hostel which means that I, thankfully, do not have to deal with the entitled gemstone wielding species of guest, but it does mean that I occasionally have to deal with the crackpipe and lunacy wielding sub-species of alleged humans. The crackhead in this tale called in to book under the name Crystal (no joke) \*generic English surname\*. When guests call in to book we always make it very clear that they need to bring a form of identification with them as the laws of our country state that we need to make a copy of said ID at check-in. Miss Crystal duly arrives at the front desk without any form of ID and a truly impressive array of ""crack teeth"". Red flag number one. You know how junkies always give you their unsolicited life story before you can even get past a greeting? Well, that happened and we learned that she had all her documents stolen when her handbag was lifted from her in a restaurant (this is actually somewhat believable in our crime-ridden city) and that she hadn't applied for new ones due to the fact she was returning to her hometown of (insert city name here) in 2 weeks. My incredibly (un)helpful manager tells her that she can still check in as long as she goes to the police station and gets an affidavit with her ID number and the details of the theft. She cheerfully agrees and her equally sketchy looking friend loads her in her car and they drive off. I made a point of informing my manager that Miss Crystal is a crackhead and she will without a doubt become a problem. This Cassandra-like prediction will absolutely come to fruition.

Miss Crystal and friend reappear at the front desk some one and a half hours later brandishing a fresh affidavit which, to my complete and utter lack of surprise, has her name as Crystal \*insert obscure German surname her\*. Red flag number two. I make a copy of the document and get her to fill in the registration form. Her friend pays for her. Another red flag (we often have people come in and pay for their ""friend"" and leave us to mop up the mess. This includes junkies, crazy people and hobos). They do actually appear to be friends though and they proceed to sit at our small outdoor bar and request a couple of bottles of wine to drink while they enjoy a beautifully balmy African sunset. Another friend in the generic hipster, flannel-wearing, scooter-riding mould appears to join them.

About an hour and a half later I hear some very heated and uncouth language emanating from the bar area (the bar is only a few metres from my desk). I go outside and inquire what in the hell is going on. I'm greeted with a barrage of screeching from the trio which I can only liken to an agitated colony of rabid Samango monkeys. At this point I look to my right and see another guest of ours in the staff dorm busy haranguing a fellow off-duty staff member about something or other. I head over to kick her out of our dorm (it's not a strictly private space given that it's shared accommodation, but it's OUR private space. And that staff member isn't working leave him TF alone he's just trying to play The Witcher FFS). She screeches and bolts off. At this point I realised that the situation wasn't going to resolve itself. Fuck.

This devolved into the Crack Club and the aforementioned guest (who I have very good reason to believe is also a junkie but at least she's quiet and paid up) have a poo slinging match at the bar. I break it up and follow the guest out to the front door when she storms off. I do my best to gather information from her about the altercation and after several round of ""stop yelling and tell me what actually happened so I can deal with it"" I manage to ascertain that Miss Crystal was threatening her. Grand. I go to the bar, kick the entire Crack Club out, but not before taking the cost of their wine our of the negligible amount that our sparkly problem paid for her dorm bed and issuing change. Problem solved.

Or not. Act 2:

Not half an hour later a girl comes in, flanked by two somewhat iffy-looking gentlemen. She has a passport from a neighbouring country but they're paying for her. Would you look at that, another red flag. At this point I could make a quilt. Check-in procedure done all by the book and I'm pleased that I managed to re-sell the bed in the dorm so yay! It was not yay.

About one and a half hours later a gentleman that I didn't recognise and who way obviously shitfaced (literally had a glass of booze in his hand and was swaying considerably) shows up at the gate and wants to check in. I asked if he had IS and he said no ""but I live around the corner my address is..."" I responded that I cannot check anyone in without ID and at that point he started demanding to see the new arrival. As a rule we don't let unknown randoms into the property, which is only sensible, so I found the guest and informed her that there was someone there to see her. She didn't want to speak to him so it fell on me to inform the drunken lout that he was not welcome. Said drunken lout proceeded to recline in our driveway and shout incomprehensible drunk BS at myself, his friend who was with him and the world in general while repeatedly ringing my doorbell.

My manager and I both attempted to extract him from him apparently comfy spot in our driveway given that we were expecting a guest to be dropped off via taxi in the next few minutes. We even pointed out a handy spot of pavement not three metres away where he could lounge and rant to his heart's content. No dice. He ranted about ""that's my second wife!"" and ""do you know who I am?!"" and ""fuck you white people 400 years of slavery and I'll come back here and show you something something drunk crap"" (please note, I'm from South Africa and slavery was never a thing here, at least in the literal sense. Also, South Africa as a country is less that 400 years old). Eventually the girl comes out of her dorm and says she'll go and talk to him. I made it clear to her that we would take no responsibility if she left and that she would not be allowed back on the property if she chose to go out, but also that she was safe with us and we would look after he if she wanted to stay the night. She declined and left.

So, I suppose, if you got this far, where the Celebrity component of the tale comes in. Well, as you can imagine, the ruckus in the driveway managed to attract the attention of pretty much all the staff. I wondered why the guys were looking a bit wide-eyed at the dust up I was having, but when I was cashing up they informed me that Driveway Guy is a fairly well known kwaito artist. He had a show back in the 90's which was essentially aimed at keeping kids in school and out of drugs and gangsterism. What a brilliant role model.Of Crackheads and Celebrities",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"Hey! Haven't posted a tale in awhile here. Had some doozies but this one is the most recent. 

See, this morning we had noticed a shady man hanging around the hotel lobby and chatting with a guest that we already had our eyes on for other shady behaviors. They go up to his room and are there for awhile, then we see him come down back down to the lobby until we decide that he needs to go. Security talks to the guy and he ends up leaving. Later on that morning, our houseperson is cleaning the lower lobby restrooms off of the breakfast area and finds 3 hundred dollar bills in one of the stalls! Being a responsible employee, they bring it to the front desk to await it's owner....however, the 7-3 crew instantly identify the bills to be fakes. Normally, U.S. Currency doesn't have Chinese Characters printed on the back. A counterfeit pen confirmed that the bills were indeed fake. 

Before we could call the authorities however, who should appear at the desk but the shady man from earlier! He walks up to the front desk and tells the desk staff -

""Yeah, so I left a few counterfeit $100 bills in the bathroom downstairs, would I have them back?""

Excuse me....but *what?!?!?!*

Obviously we tell him no! But then he gets all huffy and is like, ""But...that's my personal property! You need to give it back!""

To which we tell him that his personal property is *highly illegal* and we would be turning it into the authorities. 

He resigns his fate and leaves the hotel, never to be seen again...but *wow*. What kind of audacity does one need to have to openly admit that kind of stuff?!!?! The kicker is, when we called the police to report the counterfeit bills, they told us that since it was his property, **we should have given them back**. *Seriously?!?!?* Our GM texted her neice who is a cop in a neighboring district and was shocked that we got that answer from he metro PD. We ended up calling our local secret service branch and they took in the bills for investigation.But....that's my personal property!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I'm sure a lot of you have been dealing with snow recently, our town is no exception. Friday it snow pretty hard and a lot of people cancelled, no biggie. We have a snow plow guy but obviously they have more than just one property the plow for so we can only hope they hit our place as soon as possible. But alas it was going well into the night before they could get to us. So I being the only worker onsite had to help people who were stuck. I helped 2 people get to a spot that wasn't actually a parking spot but was good enough, it was out of the way. Then this couple came, some lady asks me nicely to come help them because they were stuck getting into the parking lot. No biggie, I put on my coat and gloves, grab a shovel and head out. It was about 10:15pm so dark out and almost the end of my shift. I get to their car and immediately start trying to move snow around their front tires when the guy gets out the car and starts SCREAMING at me about how shitty our hotel is and how they've been coming in and out of our hotel all day and we haven't gotten plowed and how  unacceptable it is that he'd have to park in the adjacent business parking lot and that's when I start having a panic attack and just leave him there yelling and go back inside and hide in the back till my relief came. The lady came back inside and waited at the desk, I saw on the cameras but I'm not going to help anyone who's going to treat me that way, they can stay stuck there and get out themselves. I know it was the guy who was a dick but I don't care, not worth the stress.Snowstorm and people getting stuck.",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
"I apologize if this seems to be going everywhere, I'm down to a few hours of sleep a night. I'm just trying to put it all down. 

This hotel is sinking and I was about to go down with it. One of my last posts involved a lot of wrong doings going on at my location, but due to some good advice, I've been keeping records of everything.  I was hoping to find a new job, even looking outside of the hospitality, but haven't had any luck. Even follow ups went nowhere. So sadly I was stuck. 

Good news is that my husband is PCS-ing(?) to a very square state in the middle of the map, so I'm excited to get out of here! However, I am stressing so hard over finding a job out there that it's keeping me up, amongst other things. I hope to stay in the hotel business but with the luck I've had looking for something down here my vision is very bleak.

Looking past that, I was able to fight for a raise, and fight to become an actual manager at the location I'm at now. I had the DM approach me recently to ask if I was interested in becoming an AGM or a GM at a location they're opening up, but had to turn that down since I'm leaving in March and it hasn't opened yet. 

My current GM is probably not going to be on for much longer. She has an insanely high turn over, where there is only five employees that have been here longer than six months. We're constantly under stocked even though she keeps going over budget. She runs to the store when we run out of items, but sometimes get the wrong items. She bought sleeves that were too small for cups, for example, and the amount of guests that spilled coffee on themselves forcing it to fit was too damn high. If it wasn't for me our invoices and bills would go unpaid. Our scores are low low low. The only tens we get are staff interactions. As soon as we get a department properly filled with people, she looks at the hours they get, and then they're fired. In this week alone she's fired three people who were showing promise of actually staying here. As far as I'm aware, many Front Desk plan on leaving when I do, since she never supports us, and will throw us under the bus to make herself look good to her boss, and the guests. I again got written up for following policy. That she put in place. Because a guest said it inconvenienced them. I refused to sign that one too. 

Ever since I put in my resignation she's been playing with my schedule, even though I can only work certain days. Sometimes I'll get twenty hours. This week I get one day off, and she wants me to come in for it. She tried to tell me she won't give me the overtime for it, but I let her know I'm tracking all hours. If I don't get paid it'll get added to the rest of the folder.

I'm just excited to start a new chapter in my life, with everything that I've learned. Hopefully to carry it to wherever I fall next. At least I'm not going down with the shipI'm finally leaving!",TalesFromTheFrontDesk
