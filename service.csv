"Hey all, we just want to touch base with all of you and let you know where we stand with regards to posts right now. 

We've seen a lot of posts of people trying to help and up until now we've been directing those posts to the COVID-19 megathread. But I think we may have been doing the sub a disservice by adhering to our rules by the letter, because different times call for adapting the rules a bit. 

So for now we will be using our discretion when it comes to posts that traditionally wouldn't be allowed here. That doesn't mean it's open season and you can post whatever you feel like, but if a post rises to the level where we think it needs to be seen by the whole subreddit, we will approve those posts. Posts with links will still be automatically filtered out upon submission and the mods will get a notification informing us to go take a look at the post. 

We'd love any feedback from all of you. It helps us make this subreddit the best it can be. Our hearts and thoughts are with you now through this tough time. 

By the way, the new server advice thread is right [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/dvvyw7/dedicated_thread_for_new_server_advice/) We'll sticky a new one when this has all blown over.

"This happened at my first hostessing job years ago but it still makes my blood boil til this day lol. 

It was a usual busy weekend and an elderly couple walks-in with no reservation and I told them it’s a 15 minute wait but luckily there’s no one in front of them and they were PEEVED. The restaurant is an open floor plan and you can see the entire dining room from the front door, but I guess they couldn’t see that well because obviously they couldn’t tell how busy we were. The elderly couple sat in the waiting area and waited while staring me down. Not even a few minutes later, some people came in that are actually meeting a big party that’s already half there and seated, they just needed help finding their friends. I showed them where their friends were, and when I got back up to the host stand, the old lady threw her hands up in the air and said “what the fuck?!!” and the old man went *berserk*

“WHY DID YOU SEAT THOSE PEOPLE?! WE WERE HERE FIRST!” 

I explained to him that they weren’t a new table, that their party already arrived 30 mins ago, and they’re just the remaining guests left of that big party. You would THINK that would be the end of his bitch fit, but since he knew he couldn’t be mad at me because I actually was right, he started going off about something else.

“WELL YOU BETTER DO YOUR JOB RIGHT THEN AND SEAT US RIGHT NOW! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!”

I replied, “ Don’t worry sir, I know how my job works. I’ll seat you when there’s actually something available.” And made them wait an extra 10 minutes on top of their 15 just to be petty, but they literally didn’t even  notice.

Idk why this story still gets me raging.“WHY DID YOU SEAT THOSE PEOPLE?! WE WERE HERE FIRST!”",TalesFromYourServer
"Luckily this was back in my college days and I no longer work in food service (bless you all, everyone should have at least one job in the service industry at some point in their lives just to know what it is like). 

Anyway, In the late 90s I was a waitress at an internet coffee shop/cafe. The place was named after the owners son: “Entitled Kid’s Cafe.” And over the summer EK would often hang out at an empty table for an hour or two while mom and dad were handling owner type stuff. 

No big deal. I like kids, it usually wasn’t busy at those times, and I didn’t really mind keeping half an eye on him for them. Then this interaction  happened. 

EK (from across the room): Hey Aixlax! Get me a chocolate milk!

Me: Ok just a second!

I finished ringing up a customer - it maybe took me another 60 seconds. I look down and there is EK. He kicks me in the shins, hard. 

EK: Where’s my chocolate milk?

Me: It’s not okay to kick people. Where’s your mom?

EK: Doesn’t matter. It’s EKs cafe and that means I’m the boss of you. Get me a chocolate milk NOW! (Kicks me again)

He’s screaming at this point and the owner came in the check on us. I looked to her for support. 

Owner: Well? Get him his chocolate milk already!

That was the day I started looking for a new job. I’ve got other stories about this place. Because this was back when a lot of people still had dial up (or no internet at all) and we had decent connections we would get people who camped out all day playing video games on our PCs and generally being rude and nasty all the time. I’ll post some more of those later.5 year old thinks he’s my boss. Unfortunately he kinda is.",TalesFromYourServer
"Okay, this is one of my oldest stories about the people we have come to know as, well, just the people who come into restaurants.

I was actually hosting at the time and there was a woman, who seemed a bit homeless, not unusual for our area of Seattle. Her hair hadn't been washed in awhile (or she just didn't tame some serious bedhead for the day) and her clothes were a tiedyed ragged tshirt with frayed bootcut jeans (this is 2004. You can just imagine that.)

She kept coming to the host stand for more and more silverware, when we used to the roll them. We don't know what was doing on back at her table, but at one point, we hear this frustrated, high pitch scream and she runs with the knife and into the bathroom. Now, I'm thinking she's going to harm herself. We immediately dial 911.

Our manager was hungover, underpaid, and could not care less. He actually came up and was laughing hysterically and said ""Did you guys see that?"" And I, being a mature 20-year-old, said ""yeah, we called 911""

The manager starts to freakout because some things, as always, are not up to code or food safety could be an issue. But then, the medics arrive and we get in the bathroom, and she's BENT OVER....

TRYING TO RIP OFF HER SHOELACE WITH THE KNIFE.

The medics ended up moving her outside to a bunch of benches we had and getting her settled and calm, retied her laces so she could just slip her feet in and out. One of them was kind enough to walk with her down to the (what was then) the bus stop and obviously her food just went into the trash, and that was a story we told newbies for years.

Forget running with scissors. It's the knives in casual burger joints you really have to be careful of. And yet....I still kept going back. I guess these stories were too good not to watch unfold each day.The Woman Who Ran With A Knife To The Bathroom",TalesFromYourServer
"Okay, so I work in a bar. A party of office workers from across the road came in one night. Most of them are okay. One of them, a woman who I'll call ""Sarah"" from now on, was pretty drunk. At around 11pm, she asks me for a baked snack that that we no longer sold. I told that her that we don't have any. Confused, she said ""But I was here a few months ago, you had them then"". I explained that we stopped selling them. Again, she says ""but you used to sell them"". Again, I explained that we don't sell them any more. Completely serious, she says ""Can you make me one?"". I couldn't believe the cheek of this woman. Incredulously, I said ""....*Make* you one? I'm a bartender not a cook, and the kitchen's closed for the night"". (The cook had left over an hour ago and even, if by chance, she was still hanging around, there was no reason why she, or I, should go out of our way for this womanchild). Refusing to relent, Sarah goes ""Well, can't you just defrost some?"" I explain to her that the cook, who had gone home an hour ago, used to make these savoury pastries from scratch, there's nothing *to* defrost. I told her that if she's really hungry, the supermarket, which is a 5 minute walk away, sells the snack she's after, and that they shut at midnight.

Sarah: You're really rude

Me: Am I? What have I possibly said or done that can be considered ""rude""?

Sarah: It's not what you've said, it's your demeanour.

Me: My demeanour? What about my demeanour?

Sarah. You're not very being very accommodating. You're very cold. You're not smiling.

Me: (resisting the urge to call her a toxic bitch) I'm not really a smiler.

Sarah: Well then maybe you shouldn't be working here. I expect better than this, my company (it's not *her* fucking company, she's just an employee) spends a lot of money here. I don't like your attitude.

Me: Other customers don't have a problem with me. Most of them actually find me hilarious.

Sarah: I want to see your manager (she actually said this)

Me: The manager's currently busy. (This wasn't a lie)

Sarah: What's your name?

Me: You don't need to know my name.

She kept on harassing me for my name, but I wouldn't give it to her, because I didn't want to, plus I was enjoying watching her growing frustration. I sent the security man a text telling him to not tell her my name. I stayed stoic because I refuse to give people like this the satisfaction of reacting. When they can't get a rise out of you, these people always get angry, which is hilarious. After a bit more bullshit, playing the amateur shrink, she said ""What happened to you that's made you like this? Something must have gone seriously wrong in your life to make you like this"" I held my tongue, but my assessment of her was that she comes from a wealthy family, and her parents spoil her. She followed me around the place, videoing me while ranting, threatening to have me fired, etc. This made me angry but I didn't react or say anything.Apparently not doing something that isn't even remotely your job is ""rude"".",TalesFromYourServer
"So this happened some summers ago. 

I mentioned in a comment that I worked a very large annual summer event for my business. When I say large, try 2500+ in 2.5 hours for just breakfast. This event is literally a massive venture. 

Anyways I spent 5 of my 6 year stint on a special dietary line. Educated my sorry butt about things so I would know JIC. (And I did answer a lot of questions.)

One year, this sweet gal (10-12) and her mom came to me at the end of the week and thanked me personally. Mom said this was the longest her daughter had gone without an allergen flare up while away from home. I smiled all day after. 

Happily ever after, right? Nope, gets better. 

The SAME pair show up the following year for another go at the same event. They both said they missed having breakfast with my business (they were eating lunch at the time). 

Me: doesn’t your hotel have breakfast? 

Mom: yes but no options for daughter’s allergy 

Me: but - its (a nice one in town)! 

D: yeah, not that great. I miss all your food! 

OMG! I couldn’t stop the smiles for days.I got a happy!!",TalesFromYourServer
"So a few months ago before the Coronavirus hit, the restaurant I was working at was “in season” because a lot of snowbirds were in town still and my city has something called the Gem and Mineral Show so people from all over the world travel here during this time. On an average Wednesday night we had a dining room buyout for 70 people by the American Heart Association. We only had our patio available to our other guests coming in and I was told that the morning hostess called all of the reservations for the dinner shift and told them that we would not have our dining room available due to this buyout and we could only offer our patio. And as I could see on the books, all of the reservations were okay with it. Keep in mind our patio only has about 25-30 tables and I had about 80 covers to seat. I also had multiple large parties (I’m talking 6-9 people per party) coming in that I had to fit on the patio. And of course walk-ins. 

I have never worked such a terrible shift until that night. I argued with multiple customers about why we were on a wait and guests that were informed about sitting on the patio earlier in the day acted as if they never heard of that. One of the parties of 6 showed up with SEVEN people and didn’t bother to tell us beforehand. So I had to cap their table outside which was in a corner but it was the best option we had for them considering the circumstances. And they were placed on a banquette outside since that’s where we put our large parties on the patio. (We also have multiple round tables on the patio that sit up to 4 people) And when I showed him the table he said, “nope, that’s not good enough i need another table.” And I kinda just looked at him and wanted to laugh because our entire patio was booked at that time besides that table that was set aside for him. So I told him that if he wanted to wait for another table it’d probably be 30-45 minutes He said fine and began waiting. As time went on I was able to seat other parties since tables of 2-4 people at round tables being that those tables were getting up. I pass by him and this man starts bickering at me again. “You told me we would be seated soon and we’re still waiting. This is ridiculous we’ve had a reservation”. So I had to explain again that the tables that have been getting up outside don’t accommodate his party size so if he doesn’t want the table we offered him then he needs to wait. And that means waiting until parties on the banquette get up so I can gather 5 tables to fit 7 people. I was very annoyed because he’s doing this in the middle of the patio that is completely full. Guests were beginning to stare at me and I know a lot of them already felt bad because they saw how much we were struggling due to this buyout. Of course, he then asks to talk to my manager and I grab my manager for him. And minutes later they end up sitting at the table I originally assigned him. 

Overall, worst dinner shift I have worked to this day and I have been hosting for almost 2 years before COVID-19 shut down all restaurants here. I could go on all day about that night and what I dealt with. Let’s just say a lot of guests ended up leaving that night.Dining room buy out disaster",TalesFromYourServer
"So this was last years NYE and my restaurant takes reservations. We seat them first and we always make sure to try and accommodate walk ins. I was a seater that night, and a double that day. As soon at 3:30 hit we were already going on a 30 minute wait and once it was 6pm we were slammed. 
We always tell our guests we will call out there name, we use first and last and never use pagers (guests would drop them in the fountain) So on this beautiful night I’m running around seating guests and helping clean tables. Our bar seats are all first come first serve, our waiting area out front is packed. 

I get handed my next card name to walk, it’s just a piece of folded paper with the name and party number, we set it on the tables so servers know who is new and who hasn’t been greeted yet. 
So I go and start checking outside, then I go to our very crowded very loud bar. It’s around 8 now and shit is crazy. I’m screaming out the name, and tbh I don’t even remember what it was at this point. Then this guy at the bar turns around one way and said oh party for blah blah, I said yes your table is ready, he’s like oh we will pay out. 

Then the woman next to him turns around the opposite way, so their backs are too each other. They’re next to each other too. She’s like “ oh amazing! We will pay out right now” so I’m like okay bet that was easy. I go back to the front desk and the guy comes to me and says his friends are cashing up the bill and he would like to be sat. No biggie I double verify the name there and walk him to be sat. And it’s a large party booth for 5-6 people
I get my next name card and then the woman comes up to me, and she said I called the name, I smiled and said “your other party member just sat down, just walk straight and at the very back is the large party booth” and I continue to walk my current party guests. 

Welp. They’re NOT the same party. So the lady comes up to me and says someone is in their booth, I quickly respond with the name of the guys party and she said “no you called out Jill” (I only remember her name at this point in my life) So I’m standing there and I know sure as all get out I never said that name. I look at her and I repeat the name of the guys party and I said I’m sorry ma’am I called out for the party of “Joan” let’s call it. 
When I say this woman went ape shit on me she went nuts. She immediately goes “why are you arguing with me?” 
M: “ I’m sorry I’m not arguing-“
She puts her hand in my f€”$ing face and said
“Well then seat us NOW!”

I grab our system and ask for her name, which I find out is Jill at that point. Her name is still on the wait list. I even check when she came in. SHE WAS WAITING 20 MINUTES. SHE HAD 1 Hour and 25 minutes left! 

I looked at her and straight up said “ ma’am I’m sorry for any confused but there is no possible way I could have even said your name, you were only just put down on the list” 
Her husband and her immediately rail in on me 
“Well we just gave up our bar seats so you have to get them back for us. “
Me and my head hostess, she’s hearing everything as she deals with incoming guests, joins in the convo and says “ we’re sorry for the confusion but that is first come first serve we have no authority when it comes to the bar. We thank you for your patience.” 
I think okay that’s good .... nope. She continues to scream and cuss about wanting a seat. The walk off in the lobby and I get the next card name. 
When I start to walk them WHO GOES AND SEATS THEMSELVES. 
My managers were told what was going on and we radio over headsets what happened and I was told to get them up. 

I go over and before I even talk her husband puts his mf hand in my face as well, and my Managers are seeing everything at this point. He immediately starts cussing me off telling me they’re not fucking moving, he knows out general manager and they can sit if they want. 

I lean down and I tell them they need to get up. They have waited only 25 minutes while I’ve had guests wait 2 hours and they were sure as hell not more important than my guests currently waiting on their rightful booth. That no I would not get our GM because he wasn’t there. And if he cusses in my face one more time I’ll make sure they don’t eat there tonight. 

I’m good friends with the assistant manager, she comes over with menus, and when I say slammed them down I mean the booths all near us got very quiet. 

She tells them “here are your menus since you feel your so much more important than my other guests. The server will be with you later as we are very busy, and if you ever cuss at my hostess again I will make sure you never can come back and eat in here again. And you can make damn sure Jacob will hear how you cussed her out for no reason.”
We walked away at that point. I have to say her response made me so happy, and because of their bs I got to leave even earlier that night with a free meal. I wish they could have been kicked out but there were friends of our GMs. 
The next time I saw him he apologized to me for their behavior and said they won’t be coming in again anytime soon. 
This will always be my favorite hostess story I have. So far no ones beaten it just yet but some have gotten close.Guests sit themselves down when they only waited 20 minutes of their 1h45 minute wait... on NYE.",TalesFromYourServer
"I hate this. We are curbside only and people give us a name, but when we’re busy it’s hard to verify, and then when they’ve been there for awhile we ask if it could be under a different name. They say no and tell us what they had. Then we say could it be under “x”?

"The gist is in the title.  But the restaurant I work at offered me a spot doing takeout (I'm normally a server), but I don't want to do it.  With the new $600/week stimulus I'd be making more on unemployment than I would doing takeout.

Maybe that makes me sound like ""not a team player,"" or whatever, but I'd just rather stay on unemployment.  

I don't mind working, I'd actually love to get out of the house. This is purely a financial decision.  I just don't know if me saying 'no' affects my unemployment.If my restaurant offers me a job to do takeout, and I refuse, does that mess with my unemployment?",TalesFromYourServer
"After 12 years of working in restaurants in chains up to fine dining James Beard type spots, I have zero faith that the restaurant industry can handle any sort of responsible re-opening measures.

Some individual restaurants I've worked at or who's owners I know, I'd trust to act to keep their staff and guests safe. But the chain restaurants that make up the majority of restaurant employers and the already shadily run spots that exist in every city, the idea of them implementing measures to keep their staff safe is a joke to me.

We are talking about an industry that is rife with labor abuses and wage theft. That routinely forces staff to work regardless of their health. One that can struggle to operate under current health and safety guidelines. One where staff is often expected to bend over backwards to each and every inane request, want, or complaint the overly entitled guest can come up with.

That's not an industry that's going to; willingly cap the number of guests, allow their staff to take extra time to ensure heightened sanitation and hygiene, promote staff taking off if ill, or any number of things that should be occurring once we begin relaxing restrictions on businesses. 

No, this is industry that I expect to let that extra party in because the manager doesn't want Karen who sees that purposefully kept open to maintain proper distancing table and demands she be sat now. This is an industry that's not going stand up for the server who gets a complaint because they handed down plates because proper service would require them getting right up next to the guest. This is the industry where that line cook can't call out with what hopefully is just a cold without getting shit from the boss.

I'm glad I'm out of the industry and I'm sorry for all the thankless extra work you'll all be having to do, probably earlier then you should be doing it, for somehow still ungrateful guests.

And to anyone going out to eat in those early stages, take a second and realize it's not going to be like it was, not at first. You will wait longer to get sat, you will wait longer for your food, your served won't be checking on your table ever 2 bites. Things had to change to even allow you the option of eating in that restaurant, so just calm down and say thank you.I do not trust the restaurant industry to act responsibly when it comes to re-opening.",TalesFromYourServer
My restaurant will be open probably by the 1st. Before we closed business was extremely slow. First of all the financial impact of the corona virus has not been fully felt imo and even if we get busy after opening it won’t last long.

"I was a host at a chain restaurant for about a year. Thankfully I escaped right before covid and got a better job. One day I was hosting in the morning and we were unexpectedly busy. Servers are in the weeds and multiple parties keep coming in preventing more than one server from taking anymore tables, and bonus kitchen is backed up. And then in walks a group of 20-30. They were a highschool girls soccer or something and some adults. Now there's no where to seat these people and we're on a wait anyways, I tell them about an hour which honestly pretty good for such a large party on short notice. Now the leader of the group was a coach he didn't have to big of problem with the wait just sort of joked about it. The teenagers though are pointing out open tables ""why can't we sit there, or there"" and on and on. I bite my tongue and politely tell them that there are people ahead of them and those spots they pointed out are all dirty and way too small for them. The seats they were pointing out were 4 tops. I'm not about to split up such a large party all over the damn restaurant the servers would have killed me. So I'm sitting other parties and having to squeeze by this huge party standing right in front of the host stand pretty much completely blocking the entryway. All I can hear when I get to the host stand is this one little brat going on how she's a host and she doesn't understand why they can't be seated now. She's talking to her friends so I do my best to just ignore it. I know I'm doing my job right. BUT THEN SHE STARTS GREETING GUESTS AS THEY COME IN like she's the fucking hostess and is fucking everything up because they're trying to get on the wait list and this girl's giggling and laughing I've never wanted to hit someone so bad. I deal with it though I get the guests on the wait list and try to ignore the whole party while trying to get them sat asap so I could get them the fuck out of my waiting area. Still seating smaller parties, but now this motherfucker is going up to MY host stand and fucking with my iPad and looking at it, and as soon as she sees me runs back to her group giggling. Of course all the adults are acting like this is totally okay and funny because why fucking not. This is of course a chain restraint so there's no point going to a manager cause all they're going to say is just do your best to seat them quickly. FINALLY the last table I was waiting to get up to seat the party leaves and I called the busser to clear it and headed over to start cleaning and putting the tables together myself because I'm a little impatient and the busser at the time is shit and never cleans the tables I ask for. I just wanted the party GONE. Thankfully after that party got sat we slowed down only good thing that happened that day.The time a guest ""hosted"" for me",TalesFromYourServer

"It’s been a few years since I worked at this place, but it sticks out as one of the most poorly run businesses I’ve ever had to work at and I’ve had a LOT of jobs!!

This was a few years back and I was in desperate need of a job that would let me balance work and school. I knew one of the hostesses, she talked to the manager and I was offered the job at the interview. The manager seemed young and a little inexperienced, turns out this is first time ever managing a restaurant. But that’s okay, because we have a backup manager who doubles as the head chef. Aaaaand, that’s it. That’s the management team. They’re also secretly dating (why not?) and have these crazy blow-out fights that literally everyone can hear because we have an open kitchen. Awesome. 

Oh, and the FOH manager is also waiting tables. Yeah. She has her own section (by far the largest) and expects me (the new hostess) to keep it full at all times. Right. So, we have a manager with a giant busy section and a manager who is a chef and always on the line, which is fucking insane. 

Oh, and this restaurant is BUSY. It’s decent Italian food and one of the nicer places on this side of town, so we got a lot of people on dates or celebrations, etc. we would easily have a 2-3 hour wait on weekends.

So, let’s picture this. It’s a beautiful weekend night. We have FOH manager with her massive section (she took literally a quarter of the floor) and BOH manager cooking away. We’re on a two hour wait. My hostess stand is shoulder to shoulder and FOH manager decides that she can’t be bothered with managing anymore (it was cutting into her tips, she said that, I shit you not) so she passes over the managing duties to the other hostess, who is maybe 18 and worked there like 3 months at that point. Other Hostess decides that we need to give the kitchen a break and tells me not to seat anyone. I told her that we can tell the servers to not take orders for a second, but we should definitely seat people. She just tells me “no” and stares into space and then just...walks away. I still don’t know where she went. Right. So I go to ask managers what we should do and get screamed at for interrupting FOH when she’s running food and interrupting BOH when he’s cooking food and just give people a free glass of wine and fuck off.

K. So, this is an open concept restaurant- there’s literally only a half wall between the kitchen and the floor. Everyone heard about the free wine and it’s a fucking free for all. The wine was kept on a table in the middle of the floor (open concept) so the people by the host stand run over and grab bottles of wine. We have all these empty tables now, so they also decide to seat themselves. I give up at this point, but they managed to seat themselves all in the FOH section and she told me to keep it full, so there ya go. 

I quit pretty soon after this, and the restaurant has since closed down. Which is CRAZY because it was always busy!! I’ve had wilder jobs, but this is the only place I’ve worked at that had a manager working a section and it was honestly the worst way to run a restaurant. Which FOH might have know if she’s actually been a manager instead of the owner’s spoiled ass kid, but hey, what do I know?How not to run a restaurant",TalesFromYourServer

"At store this past Sunday with a friend of mine. We both are waiting in line to buy stuff and our register was pretty close to the customer service desk. My friend is staring at the customer service desk and then nudges me to look. 

Woman is at customer service desk complaining. She is going on and on about NOT being able to return the two packages of toilet paper that she had bought 2 months ago! (store policy was that they were NOT accepting returns for that item along with disinfecting wipes, rubbing alcohol and other cleaning products). So, this woman looks like a classic Karen in every single way right down to the frosted bobbed hair. It truly was the perfect Karen cut! Also in yoga pants (so, yeah, on point).

So this discussion between the hapless store employee and Karen is getting ugly. Store employee is no match for Karen who is well-versed in Karen language and using the terms to get her way (i.e. 'why is the store policy only applicable to THOSE items"" and ""I buy stuff here all the time and have never seen that sign"" and ""I have a store credit card here and have for over 10 years. I give you so much business and I am going to cancel my card if you don't allow me to return these items."") 

Then, Karen being Karen, goes right for the jugular: ""Need to speak to your manager right now!"".

My friend who is with me is a server at a pretty popular restaurant in the same city (I am a bartender but not at the same restaurant). She knows the woman complaining. My friend starts telling me that the woman complaining is her WORST nightmare. She would always come into the restaurant with her 2 kids and demand all sorts of special stuff for free than complain about not taking some type of coupon or membership discount card.
AND, the best part, this woman's name really is KAREN!!

So, my friend yells over to her ""Hey Karen, how are you?"" 

To which, the woman explodes ""HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME IS KAREN!!!??? Who the hell are you? Just mind your own damn business and stop acting like you know me. Don't call me by my name like you know me!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!""

So a few of the other employees are now snickering to themselves , including the cashier that is our cashier for our line who says to us ""Seriously, is her name really Karen?"" To which my friend tells her yes, absolutely and she is a TOTAL 100% Karen. My friend then tells the cashier that this woman comes into her restaurant and pulls the same shit all the time and at least now, she knows that it just isn't her that is the target of her missives. 

We stick around to see if Karen gets her way because, well, I insisted to see the outcome because I wanted karma to kick Karen's ass. YEP, karma kicked Karen's ass in this case as the store REFUSES to return the toilet paper and recommended she donate it to charity or a shelter or community group that provides necessities for those in need. The manager even told Karen that if she wanted to leave it at the store, he would make sure it got to a group that needed it more than she did.

HA HA HA HA HA, Karen's head EXPLODED at that point as she dragged the toilet paper back to her car.  

Total karma payback. Worth the wait to see. My friend can't wait to see Karen back after the restaurant reopens as she is planning on bringing a roll of toilet paper to the table along with the menu for Karen, as a fun new promotion for the restaurant reopening!Karen gets called by her name",TalesFromYourServer
"Since closing our dining room, our phone has been ringing off the hook.  It’s been four weeks and people are still calling to ask if our dining room is open.  They also call to ask the stupidest questions.  They want us to list the entire menu over the phone, or will call and not know what they want and then spend 5 minutes trying to decide what they want.  Or they call and ask us to describe our BOTO promotion then get mad when the second entree is cold and only includes one salad.

I spent 10 minutes on the phone with a guy trying to describe how big our salads are.  Sir they are two portions in the restaurant, 11 ounces, if you and your wife don’t get any refills when you’re in the restaurant it will be enough, if you do get refills you will want to order 2.  He still did not understand and hung up when I told him I would get a manager.  Another lady yelled and cursed at my coworker for asking for a name for the order.  How the fuck are you supposed to pick it up if we don’t have a name.  Some lady called to complain about how we charged her for extra sauce.  She wanted 6 extra sides of Alfredo added in the comments.  We charged her for 2 and gave her 6 but she didn’t think she should have to pay for any of them.  

The best part of this is that people call nonstop at our busiest times and get mad when we put them on hold because we’ve got 6 calls and only 3 phones.  Half of these phone calls will be asking how early they need to place their order. Well right now it’s a 20 minute wait, but if you call back at 6 is might be an hour and a half.  They will ask a bunch of questions and then say okay I’ll call back later to place an order.  Like just place your orders now and we will set them for the time you want but calling twice is a huge waste of our time and slows down the orders for everyone else.  

Just needed to rant!

"Hey guys I wasn't too sure where to post this but I figured a lot of you are in the same boat as me and could have some nice input.

My manager sent out a message to our staff this morning letting us know we are reopening for full service on May 3rd. I live in a suburb of Minneapolis, MN and have admired how our governor has handled this situation thus far but when I woke up this morning to that message it alarmed me.

Since I'm a server, it's not like I can stand 6ft away from my tables and I also have to handle their food to an extent. The restaurant will reopen with new safety guidelines but I am genuinely scared to be putting myself in such close quarters with loads of people already. You can't eat and wear a mask at the same time and N95 masks are basically restricted to medical fields.

Everyone will have reduced hours and I can't imagine many people are ready to go sit down and eat in public again. The way unemployment is set up right now, I'm making just shy of my typical weekly earnings but when I start working again I'll have to get off unemployment only to be coming back to far less hours and considerably less business. I'm nervous how little money I might be making when I come back. 

I'd love to hear from you guys, what do you think? Am I being overdramatic?

Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented I tried my best to reach back to you. It looks like once I go back with limited hours I’ll still be able to qualify for unemployment, which is a huge win. Still nervous that this isn’t the right move but only time will tell. If my boss updates the situation I’ll follow up again. Stay safe everyone!Reopening on May 3rd",TalesFromYourServer

"Mobile, English speaker, grammar, formatting, blah, blah blah.

A younger looking couple, came in today and got sushi. (Honestly only their faces looked young, so age is questionable? He was easily 6'1 or so, and she was at least 5'11 or so. Despite height, I would've placed them around 18-20. Def would've ID'd them for alcohol if they tried for some to-go)  

They walked past the line I had placed for customers to stay behind and wait, ordered on a physical menu (laminated and dry-erase markers) - and then she walked further into the restaurant (past signs we had up) to give me her menu, by hand, while I was on the phone taking another order already.

But whatever, she didn't want their order to be forgotten. No big deal, 28$ even.

They waited in their car until I brought it out to them. She tried to pay with one card, and it declined twice, so I ran it back out to her in the parking lot. Got a second  card from her and worked just fine. No tip. 
{It honestly doesn't bother me. Even though patrons don't have to tip, a lot of regulars and even first timers leave better tips, especially if I run it to their cars.**}


Not to mention, when I brought it out to their car, they had a bottle of wine in the center console, totally open, not corked or lidded.


Trying to make small talk while the boyfriend signed the receipt for her own card, the girl basically said they don't care about corona or catching it; apparently don't care about getting caught drinking and driving either, with an open bottle in the front seat. 🙄



Also, I thought about calling the police way later. Waiting wasn't my smartest choice, especially when I saw an accident on the way to work earlier this day, but I never called the police. Just thought they lived close and on my last day at this job today, I sadly just didn't care. Awful, I know. I figured they live close, idk.

"I work at a restaurant that is doing curbside only. We got so busy tonight. I have been working Fridays and Saturdays, but this random Wednesday was the busiest shift I’ve worked since we went to togo only. I had no idea why until a random lady said “we all got our stimulus checks and we’re tired of cooking at home.”

It made so much sense. We were 30-40 min over our projected time for pickup. It was crazy, but everyone was so understanding. I had people tip me on top of the tip they left online. The only people being rude.. doordash. They were honking at me, yelling at me. Even though I told them that they were given incorrect wait times. I’ve been in the industry for a long time and tonight was a nightmare.

"I am posting this on behalf of my little sister who is also my coworker. 

Yesterday, she was the only server working curbside. We are offering delivery and curbside, but delivery orders are scarce. It’s a shock when we get them. We only do deliveries within a 5 mile radius with a $5 charge as well as a $25 minimum for a meal. We also have to let customers know if they want delivery that we are only accepting card payments. Our restaurant just implemented delivery, so it was already pretty unpopular. 

My sister gets a phone call which she completed as a carry out. So that means that there was no delivery charge, she didn’t tell him someone will be at his house in 30-40 minutes, she didn’t take his card over the phone, and she never got an address. What she did do was tell him his carryout charge, it’d be ready to PICK UP in 15 minutes, and he didn’t pay for the meal yet. Not once did the customer tell her he wanted delivery. He literally let her order go through without stopping her. 

An hour later, the store gets a phone call. 

MS (my sister): “Thank you for calling...” 

UA (unaware asshole): “WHERE IS MY FOOD?!” 

MS: “Who is this? (Name is confirmed) Your pickup has been ready for an hour now.” 

UA: “PICKUP? I ASKED FOR DELIVERY! Get me your manager!!!” 

She gives the phone to the manager who is also a server. My sister explains what is up and of course... she is cringing. Our manager is not a pushover and she’s the best person to have handle these things. 

M: “Yes, can I help you?” 

UA: “Did she give you the rundown on what she did? She did not do delivery for my family! She made us wait an hour! Because of her (I shit you not he said this. Both my sister and our manager told me this verbatim), OUR FAMILY IS STARVING BECAUSE OF HER! SHE IS TRYING TO KILL OUR FAMILY!” 

M is not going to take any shit. 

M: “How are we even suppose to do a delivery if you didn’t even at least give her an address? She would’ve known you wanted a delivery then!” 

UA starts huffing and puffing over the phone. I assumed he was stammering over himself because now it literally can’t be pinned on my coworkers. Nonetheless my manager had to give him a 10% discount because of our strict “customers always right policy” (we can’t stand our ground much because our GM’s dad is our owner and would kill us if we didn’t feed in to assholes like these). What she did do is tell him that she’s not having it delivered. She said if he wants the pizza and discount so bad, he has to pick it up.

"Greeting servers and bartenders. 

All these take out and carry out posts have me remembering our Christmas Gift Card Promotion. 

So I work at a Brazilian Steakhouse, part of a chain. This past Christmas was our first holiday season we were open, and it was successful. I'm a bartender, and on top of serving guests on the wood and making drinks, takeout and gift card sales (should be hostess or manager) are my responsibility. 

Around Christmas we were insane busy, and everyone wanted a Gift Card. And that's great. On top of that the company was offering an online exclusive deal. If you purchase an online gift card, for every $100 you purchased you were given an additional $25. Good deal. 

I'll be honest, when I have guests and servers waiting on drinks - and they are tipping me and tipping me out- selling gift cards that I make $0 off of is low on the list of priority. Like slightly below serving staff members on their break low. 

Sure, you stand there and ask to purchase a gift card, no problem.  But the process of selling a gift card was a pain in the ass and time consuming. I think because the system was new and it was the slowest Point Of Sale system (genuine POS) I have ever used. Between swipe this, print that, wait for this then match the number with the debit slip it was not set up well. 

Sometimes I would have a line up of people waiting to get gift cards. And when I wasn't serving people spending money right now tipping me right then, they were served. But it was still spilling into my 'real guest' time. How could I avoid the time-sucking gift card buyers. Well I couldn't. But then it hit me. The online deal!  

There was a 'Buy Your Holiday Gift Cards Here' promo sign at the front that did have, in smaller font, advertising the Online Only promo. BINGO!

So not too long after my plan I get a Gift Card customer. I will note, being a steakhouse, most gift cards purchased were over $100 and rarely paid with cash.

He wants over a hundred dollars. 

""Yeah, no problem let me get the branded envelope and card. Just to let you know there is a great online exclusive deal you get $25 back for every $100 you buy.""

 And success!  The website is the restaurants' name .com and win-win!  Guest gets extra $$ and I get my - and thus the guests' - time back. 

But of course it wasn't  all smooth. Sure, a few people went ""Great!  That's what I'll do!""
Some people preferred the physical gift card and didn't mind not getting the $25 promotion. But here's where things get complicated. 

Get a guy, wants a gift card, no prob tell him about the online exclusive deal, tell him he can get physical card here or do the $125 deal online. Well guess what, he wants the combo deal that doesn't exist. 
""So if I buy the card here I don't get the $25???"" - Dumbass
""It's an online exclusive promotion. So you would have to purchase the gift card online to receive the online exclusive promotion."" Me 

He gets kinda pissy, I can tell this is going to be unnecessarily confusing. 

I tell him the website can be accessed on mobile, tab or desktop. He decides to buy the online promo right there, but asks annoyed:
""So you guys aren't honouring the deal? You can't give me the extra $25 right here?!?""
""It's an online only exclusive offer. It's actually right on the board up front and if you're on the site it'll explain all the details about the promotion."" 
So he's pissy, I can tell by his body language he's not happy, making a big show of typing on his smart phone, looking at his credit card like it's Chinese Algebra. 

""It doesn't say anything about the extra $25, you guys can't just give me the extra $25 here."" Dumbass asks 


""It's an online only exclusive promotion and I have no authorization to give out any promotion or offer above what's advertised. I can get a manager but they've already been clear with staff that we can no way shape or form give the online only exclusive promo in house."" I explain while moving around and serving guests, making drinks. 


  The promotional $25 gift card was added to your online cart as you were paying, literally as you checkout it turns the purchase of $100 for $100 to $125 for $100. Then the option to print, send save or both. Nothing too crazy there for anyone who had bought anything online ever.  Well, apparently this guy and a bunch of guests have never bought anything online ever, and don't know how to print things because this soon became my problem. 


Dumbass keeps working away on his Rubik's Cube of a transaction. He seemed to have this perception that if he kept asking and stomped around and acted annoyed and frustrated at not being able to decipher the checkout page of the website I could magically give him the extra $25. I kept tending bar and offered to get him a manager. But he wasn't interested. Well, Merry Christmas!

I figured that would be the most difficult of these transactions.  It was still less time consuming then a physical gift card transaction, though barely. I was going to have to find a way to preemptively explain all this in a friendly and helpful yet quick and succinct manner. 


So more gift card purchases. I turned my 'pitch' into a quick summary to try and get it all out:

""There is an online exclusive gift card deal. If you buy $100 through our website, *******.com, you get an extra $25 sent back to you though email that you can then print or keep on your phone/give to your loved one as a gift through email. This online offer only that is only offered though our website is added to the cart right before checkout on the exclusive online only deal page. So I can see you the physical fifth card here or you can go ahead and get the deal. Let me know""...smile, and back to bartending. 

I would rhyme this off as I made drinks, bussed and cleaned/served. And most people were happy, even thanked me for pointing it out!  They appreciate it. And guess what, the very nice people who literally understood my riddle and genuinely thanked me might have been handed a free appetizer card  or two from me to add to their holiday season.  Merry Christmas! 

And a few went with physical gift cards. No prob, smile, print, click, here ya go, Merry Christmas. 

But I still got a few people who just couldn't understand. Seemingly intelligent people who drove here, who were fiddling on their phones and speaking what seemed to be English:

“What do you mean Exclusive Online Promotion Only that is only offered through your website??"" -Another dumbass

Try answering that one without being sarcastic. It was hard. 

“I don't know how to do this online thing! (They go to hand me their phone like it's a time bomb on its last second)  -Dumbasser 
 
Me backing away:

“Oh geese I've never actually been on the website, I'm actually pretty technologically dense, I still have a Blackberry (true).  I'd hate to be responsible for messing up/dropping your smart phone. I can get a manager to help you out of you want."" 

“I want to get this for my aunt/cousin/sister and they don't have a cell phone...” (Yeah sure) - Dumbass

“ah, no cell phone. I really respect and admire that. No distractions, being unreachable when you want to be. That's cool sure don't hear about that very much anymore."" - Me

“Well how do I get it to my aunt??"" (As if I care) - Dumbass 

“Oh, just print it off. I'm 99% sure you can print documents from a smart phone. I'm pretty technologically behind but if you need a hand I can get a manager or maybe theres a helpline on the website you're on right now."" Me explaining that printing something off of a phone or desktop else is actually possible. Who knew?

“What if I don't have a printer?” - Dumbass 

“ I don't know. Maybe try Staples or Kinkos, Wal Mart or even the hotel that we're attached to, it has a business hall."" - Me

“Staples?!  Does that cost much?!?"" - Dumbass 

“Hmm, I'm not actually sure of the prices for printing paper at Staples are. Or anywhere else really. I guess when I'm on my break I can go to my locker and get my phone, fire up good old Google and check online prices. I won't be on any kind of break for another hour or so, until the next bartender is on I'm  afraid. But I'll grab my phone and check that info when I can. Actually looks similar to the phone you're holding right now.”
- Me

So more mixed guests during those holiday gift card days. I just don't understand people who seem independent, who are adults and seem to have common sense who just totally lose the ability to think for themselves when a little bit of work or effort is required on their front. 

People who get pissed or give attitude to people who simply cannot do what you want, be it unavailable, not allowed or simply not offered can go strait to hell. 

Sure, you never know if you don't ask. Asking once “Oh, I can't get the exclusive deal here in the restaurant?”, sure I appreciate you trying. But it's a hard no. 

And people who look at the positives, who realize that I just got you/your gift recipient an extra $25 you didn't know about and thank me, well guess what you're probably getting some free appetizers, I'd usually give one for the gift buyer and one for the gift recipient if they were pleasant and let me go on bartending. 

And I even got a $10 and a hand shake from one guy. Guess which guests I went out of my way to say hi to in the new year when I saw them return?  Which guests would get a little more wine, faster service and sincere joy at us seeing their arrival?  Anyways people are dumb. That's it. 

TL;DR : - Online exclusive offer is only offered online exclusively.“Sorry, we aren't offering the 'Exclusive Online Only Offer' in store....” - Apparently I created an impossible to solve riddle",TalesFromYourServer

"11:30 am on Sunday is a time where a vacant 30-top is not out of the ordinary. It's a minor annoyance that this particular 30-top has sat vacant for half an hour after the time for which it was requested, but the restaurant is still only a third full, if that. The mental *ka-ching*\-ing recurrent in a server's mind makes the minutes pass swiftly.

In blow three thirty-something women, with fistfuls of mylar balloons and several shopping bags brimming with ostentatiously-wrapped packages that will spend most of the party strewn over the next two adjacent sections. However, this is also not out of the ordinary. Much of our clientele prefers to celebrate loudly and publicly, with as much fanfare as humanly possible.

The ringleader of these women is meticulously primped. Schoolteacher type, probably teaches musical theater at a junior high. Magenta lipstick rims half of her venti Starbucks cup. For the next half hour, she will be consumed with table decorations.

Now, big parties often bring balloons and/or a centerpiece. Sometimes there’s a cake we are asked to hold back in the walk-in, but this is a special case. Place cards lettered by hand (poorly) in paint marker and adorned with silvery stickers. Confetti and glitter up and down the table. Stuffed animals here and there, and random party favors. Fart Gum for Omar, Wonder Bubbles for Dekota.

She must be Robin's mother, the celebrant whose name we have deduced by its emblazon upon aforementioned mylar balloons.

There is a ""6"" in the numbered birthday candles that James is given by the host herself, to decorate the cake for its presentation. We figure our assumptions are correct--it's just another self-important mommy throwing a ridiculously lavish party for a six year old. The house-shaped boxes from the Build-a-Bear store at the neighboring mall will probably be giving the attendees away any moment.

The party trickles in slowly as the host waits with rapt anticipation, each small clump of guests escorted in by the host herself. For a while nobody dares sit at this monstrosity of a 30-top table, instead preferring to pretend it table does not exist. We were told that the host insisted specifically upon one long table, which meant the back of the restaurant, by the kitchen and bar. The jungle--the secluded section so named for its border of fake plants up near the front--would simply not do.

Other people being sat request tables as far away from this one, its silence is the calm before what is certain to be a storm of blowers, party poppers, flying confetti, all culminating with a thundering chorus of ""Happy Birthday.""

As we sit and gawk at this slow-moving soirée over the course of the next hour (well over an hour past her quoted ETA, mind you) there are no Build-a-Bear boxes, just a loose gaggle of adults that act like they don't know the host, sprinkled with a kid here or there who is too young to care.

The mostly-childless adult turnout means that James will be making more in a grat, as it won't be a table full of kid cheese pizzas and mommy half-salads with dressing on the side. This particular host is definitely making him work for it, though. She's already asked if they can do just straight iceberg in the salads, that an iceberg-romaine mix won't do, what's vegan, what desserts are sugar-free. No, we don't have Splenda.

The party progresses and aside from the overage of silly decor it's largely ignorable as there are lots of big parties, especially on Sundays.

Robin was ready for the cake, we were informed. Tommy, Kevin and I attempt to conspire with James to theatrically drop the cake before he makes it to the table, but no such plan will materialize. The candles have been lit, James emerges, the host instructs everyone to sing Happy Birthday. But nobody has told James where to go with this damn cake.

Robin is the host.

Robin is the woman who has been in our midst for the past almost three hours.

Robin went through all this trouble and nit-pickery to throw her own party fit for a six-year-old child of a Mafia Don.

Robin brought her own gifts and left them over two sections' worth of the restaurant.

Later on, Robin will be videotaping her own party.

"So...my best friend works in a restaurant as well.  

This morning, his boss sent out a group text stating that his stimulus money was about to come through.  The pay rate for their  employees will be based on a formula determined by the bank.(?!?!?!?) 

The boss asked if anyone was on unemployment and told his staff that they could not double-dip (receive unemployment and pay) as the penalties would be severe.  The boss went on to say that he would schedule staff to clean the restaurant.  If they refuse, he will terminate them.Paycheck Protection Program",TalesFromYourServer
"I’ve seen some people recounting some of their best stories. This one is pretty short and pretty funny looking back. 

Serving one night in New York City. 
Table of 4, younger group probably in their mid 30s. 

Woman asks me: “What is the lemon charred chicken, like what part is it?”

Me: “it’s a half chicken, on the bone.”

Woman: “but.. wha- what half of the chicken?”

Me: *thinking in my head ‘what chef would serve one person the “top half” of the chicken with just breast and another person the bottom half, like you have to wait to find out what half you got’* “Uh..-“

Women: I just asks cause I’m chicken racist, I only like the white meat” 

Me: -__-

It was pretty funny in the moment though, my manager spat his water out and had to excuse himself to the bathroom to have a good laugh when I told himThe Chicken Discriminator",TalesFromYourServer
"Since I have been off work for almost a month due to the virus I have been reminiscing on some crazy stories from my job. In my 7 years of serving this one takes the cake. 

I work at a sports bar and we are always busy. So like any other night we have at least a 45 min wait. This lady and her family sit down. I walk over and she immediately yells out drink orders. So I put a fake smile on and tell her that i’ll be right back with those. I get all the drinks and she ready to order for everyone when I get back. 

She orders around 50 wings for the entire table. I ask her if she wants any celery, ranch or bleu cheese with them. She says “I WANT A BUNCH OF CELERY BUT ONLY THE WHITE PIECES”. Odd request but I told her that I would try to get her the best pieces I could. 

Her food comes out and before I can even turn around she shoves all the celery toward me and says that it’s not white enough. Keep in mind I personally asked our salad guy to get the whitest pieces he could and he did. I told her that these were the whitest pieces we had because I watched the cook pick them myself. 

She told me that she worked in produce for 20 years and that I was an idiot for thinking that the celery was correct. Didn’t know we could mess up celery but apparently to this produce expert we could. She then asked for my manager of course. My manager thought I was joking when I told her the issue. 

My manager goes over and speaks with her. The lady ended up getting all the celery taken off the bill and a 10% discount. I was pissed at my manager for giving them a 10% discount because the was NOTHING WRONG. My manager said that she gave them a 10% discount because the lady said I was an imbecile and that she wasted time talking to me. 

So to end this story, this family still comes in to this day (this happened about 2 years ago). If they sit in my section I refuse to serve them and give up that table. No tip is better than dealing with that crazy again.The celery lady",TalesFromYourServer
"So when I started training for a key role in my restaurant, the cooks told me about the “witch” that haunts the restaurant.

Apparently, she’s made stacks of 1/6 pans fall off a shelf (when no where near the edge) one time when locking up, she’s made the lights inside dim up/down over and over once after I’ve locked up one night, she constantly turns off our TVs randomly throughout the day, she’s even once turned one TV on in the middle of the night and when the AM manager opened he came to a novella on TV.

One time I was locking up and walking out with 2 cooks and we heard shoes squeaking in the far corner of the restaurant. While we were all standing still as I was entering the alarm code. Cue us all scrambling to turn on our flashlights, see nothing, then run like bitches out the door.

Always came in with cute young boys although he was supposed to be dating a famous actress at the time (late 80s). Super nice; great tipper. It later came out that he was gay; long married but in the closet where he remained till his death.Since employment is low....",TalesFromYourServer
"I was already experiencing a lot of job burnout before all this, but with “the virus” around it has made it a lot worse. I’ve been working 10 hour days and have had no days off for 3 weeks. I haven’t been able to see friends, family, or anyone I care about out of fear that I’d get them sick. 

There has been disagreements about tipping forever, but during this it’s gotten to me a bit more when people don’t tip because we’re technically an “essential” business staying open for “essential” workers but all we get is people out walking their dogs and wanting a smoothie. It feels like we’re just here to be here. Yesterday was Easter Sunday and very very snowy in my state but they still told us we have to come in and be open normal hours. On a holiday, in a pandemic, during a snow storm. We were actually fairly busy all things considered. But even through that busy time, we had $1.22 in tips to split between the two of us and it did kind of upset me. I wouldn’t really care if I wasn’t risking my life but I am and it’s just frustrating.

When I go on my lunch break I see a post about pretty much the same thing by someone working in the same chain as me that had negative 50 karma and was just being downvoted to hell with people calling them greedy and nasty and saying that because of the post they were going to purposely not tip. I left on Easter during a pandemic in the midst of a snow storm with .89 cents in tips. After faking smiling and making sure things were made well and going the extra mile all day. I then had to go wait for my bus for almost an hour in snow.

I got to work today not feeling much better and honestly, I just want to be fired. A lady named Karen came in (I knew her name from her rewards account) ordered her things and left a $3 tip, told me thanks for staying open and working so hard, and gave me a smile. I almost cried over a $3 tip. 

TLDR: Karen made me cry in a good way

"I work at local high-end casual Italian joint in a wealthier part of town and we are pretty much one of the few non-fastfood places that's still open, just with takeout and Uber eats. We're running half a kitchen, 1/4 of a FOH and generally new to only doing takeout so there are more mistakes than usual. Week one was fine. Everyone was super nice, super understanding (good tips too). Week two, it's like people expect their experience to be the same as it was before COVID and if it's not it's OUR fault.

 Had a guy wait in the parking lot next door come irate because we didn't come out to his car parked a football field away

Had a guy come in and place a Togo order when we were running 1hr ticket times and he complained about the wait like 5 times and even keep commenting every time someone who called in (hours earlier) would get their food. The whole time he was sipping a complimentary beer from the owner for the wait. Then he calls back and starts YELLING at the owner that he's never coming back because we forget like a side of spinach or something.

Had a lady stiff me because I told her and her bf that no, They could not come and sit down inside and look at the menu.  Acted like I was kicking them out on the street until I told them it's literally illegal. 

We've had people come and sit on our patio and order wine while they wait (we've been told that's legal) and then when their Togo food comes out and they want to eat it on the patio and get another round and then they act like were ruining some night they have planned when they are told no.


Were running a special where you get a pizza, some meatballs and salad and a BOTTLE OF HOUSE WINE (normally just the wine is 30). We've been told not to let people pick other than white or red and it's whatever we have in stock and people are disgusted that they can't choose, like they just can't fathom not being able to choose their favorite wine.

We have 1 star Yelp review from two days ago because Uber cancelled an order because there were no drivers.

Its like all these people come in and they think ""this COVID stuff is crazy, but I'm rich so all these quarantine rules don't really apply to me""

Don't get me wrong, there have been nice people. Most have been supportive and kind, but Jesus christ. A lot of these people can just FUCK OFF.

"I've worked at the same restaurant the entire time I've been in college. It's a relatively nice steakhouse, not quite Del Friscos, but certainly nicer and more expensive than Outback. Anyways, when I first started I had no restaurant experience so I was a bus boy. 

I  was working one of my first few shifts and I still hadn't gotten the hang of holding plates with one hand and clearing them with the other. A server asked me to get all the appetizer plates off his 8 top. No problem right? When I approached the table, this woman (mid 40's, we'll call her Karen) snapped her fingers and pointed to her empty water glass. ""Water. I don't have any,"" Karen said. 

""Yes ma'am. I'll be right back with some."" 

So I refill her water with a pitcher in which all the ice had melted. ""Oh I guess it would have been too much trouble to throw in some ice?"" 

So I apologize and go get Karen a brand new glass of water. Ice and everything. ""Finally. Didn't know ice water was in such sort supply"" says Karen. I happened to make eye contact with another woman at her table who mouthed ""sorry"" to me. 

I eventually get around to clearing the appetizer plates and as I'm grabbing one, not paying attention to my other hand which is also holding plates, a ramekin of ranch dressing slides off the plates in my off hand and into to Karen's purse, which is hanging off the back of her chair. 

I was petrified. But Karen didn't notice. In fact, the only person at the table who did notice was the lady who had previously apologized on Karen's behalf. She looked at me, then at Karen's purse, then back at me, shrugged and mouthed ""Don't worry. She's a bitch."" I smiled and quickly walked away, still pretty scared. I obviously avoided that side of the restaurant until they left. 

I never told anyone until about 6 months later once I felt comfortable with my GM, I told him the story. He died laughing and told me she called the corporate office and said it got all over the inside of her purse and they gave her a couple hundred dollars in gift cards. Oh well.Sorry your purse smells like a trashcan at Buffalo Wild Wings",TalesFromYourServer
"I need some advice. Just like everyone here, we all been affected by this virus someway or another. When my restaurant shut down and switched to Togo it was rough. Many of us wonder if and when we will be able to work again. As servers we can’t work Togo unless we have been trained and have a code (management orders). If we don’t have the code then we can’t work. This put us in a tricky situation. Management said there was nothing they could do. As servers and other employees in this predicament understood. We just had to wait it out. We file for unemployment for some help. As weeks went by, management said they will try to help us in any way they can but will need to call every morning to see if they have anything for us. We would call only to be told they have filled their 10 spots already. Another week passed and luckily we had emergency pay for our job as a small financial relief while stuck with no job. It’s not much and only for a couple of weeks. Recently the stimulus bill passed which means those on unemployment can get extra help of $600 weekly. This was something we all needed. Next thing you know, management starts getting upset, claiming we are lazy and not wanting to work just to claim unemployment. Upon further notice, those who kept their job started to call in claiming they can’t work. At this point management said they would take anyone. Again we would call only to be told they filled their spots due to many people needing hours. But they would continue to complain how no one wants to work and they are always understaffed for Togo (even though they have 18+ employees in the building). If you had the opportunity to work it was slow due to over staffed (management claimed busy) and employees would be sent home only being there for 1-2 hrs. Now management started saying if and when they do layoffs they will remember who helped out in their time of need and remember those staying home being lazy. They don’t take into consideration over some people can’t work due to health, Kids, Transportations, but they biggest reason is availability they claim they need. Those who have been working since restaurant transfers to full time Togo are getting salty at people staying home due to claiming unemployment (plus the extra $600) and emergency pay. Saying they wished they had that opportunity, but the see better than that and are considered essential. Others just stoped working to get those benefits. Even though working you make more. They are slandering others people names (both management and other staff) and it’s putting us in a predicament. Should we risk going into work (some of us with Health concerns, kid to watch, or transportation n issues) knowing there is 18+ staff there during each shift so we don’t lost our job when things go back to normal (even though getting a spot to work is hard since they pick favorites every shift).

"Today got a little busy at one point, we had quiet a few people waiting outside for their orders and although strangers were distancing themselves some people who came together, were standing together, as is natural human behaviour. So I went out and kindly let everyone know that even if they're together they need to physically distance 1.5 metres apart as the police might drive past and dish out fines as they have done so before. The rules where I'm from are if you live in the same house you can go out for a walk or bike ride together, anywhere else like the supermarket or to pick up food is limited to only 1 person from that household to go out for supplies and only 2 people if help is needed to carry stuff but still adhering to the 1.5 metres rule (unless you have kids and need to look after them, apparently kids don't count as people). Anyway some Karen looks at me like I'm stupid and says ""but we all live together"" (her and 3 guys). ""Sure I understand, they'll still give you a fine if they drive past because they'll ask why everyone needed to come out to pick up your stuff. So please distance yourselves, we could get a fine to, orders won't be long."" This Karen rolls her eyes as her house mates start drifting apart and she goes ""oh it's fine they're being ridiculous."" I walk off inside to get back to my job and BOOM! FIVE O!

"I quit waiting in October 2017, but just wanted to chime in with this story. 

I live in a small city in Europe (100k population) and have then worked in a small caffe and bar in the city center. A cool little alternative place to hang out at. I was 20 at the time (am male) and have worked for a year there. Since it’s a small city I know 1/3 of the costumers privately. 

One slow Sunday night a friend (about 40) walks in for a few drinks with his then girlfriend, and another person which I don’t know. They sit at this table that is right across the bar, a bit secluded from the rest of the caffe, but in front of me directly when I’m at the bar. I bring them their drinks, all is well, a few guest still in, maybe two tables. 

After a while the rest of the guests leave and as I bring them their third round I notice that my friend and his girlfriend are getting into an argument, but I think nothing of it, since they with this other person, so they’ll probably resolve it home. 

That was not the case. 

I’m standing behind the bar doing dishes, while this argument escalates in a few seconds, and they start shouting. I dry my hands and tell them to keep it down and act normal, but they don’t even register this, because at this moment it reached the pinnacle with the girlfriend grabbing a bottle or a glass and breaking it over my friends head...

He jumps at her and I rush to push them apart, cuz I know if he grabs her it’s gonna get reaaal ugly. Now this bitch is coming over me to kick him, while the guy dropped from his bar stool and is in a corner and pretty much immobilized cuz of the fall. 

I turn around a grab the girlfriend and practically carry her out of the bar and tell her to not come in till I sort shit out. I go back in to check on the guy and he’s bloody on the head and smeared some blood over the walls, the place looks like a fucking crime scene. 

I keep him from coming out and killing her, tell her to go away, which she does with the third person that came with them and I call a cab for my friend since he insisted he didn’t need an ambulance. He leaves, I lock up the place, sit at the bar alone, shaking, have a smoke and a shot and just sit there for a while. 

Close the bar up properly, go home. That was some memorable shit.A bloody night.",TalesFromYourServer
"So a couple of summers ago I worked a summer job at family owned Japanese restaurant. I wasn’t a waiter but I worked the to go register and handled all the to go orders. I usually hung out by the to go window, or right outside the kitchen entrance because the kitchen was hotter than hell and we all had to wear long pants. On Friday nights the restaurant would get packed. It’s already a smaller restaurant and people would line up outside to get in and the to go orders would be backed up to a hour wait time. So, every Friday night at peak rush, with out fail, this couple would come in and sit at the sushi bar in the exact same seats (important later). The husband was always pleasant but the wife... god what a Karen. The wife wasn’t typically hateful or rude but she was definitely loud and obnoxious. 
 
I’m not sure the relationship the couple had with the restaurant owners but I the couple had some sort of business and every Friday night we had to wear their company T-shirts. Like I said earlier, I mostly stayed back in the kitchen doing to go orders but in order to get the sushi orders I had to run upfront to the sushi bar and get them from the chef. It was probably my first full month working and I had accidentally left the Friday night T-shirt at home. The owner said it was fine since I hung out in the back. No one would care. Or so we thought. 

Per usual of a Friday night I had to run and get a sushi Togo order. As I walked behind the bar the wife of the couple looked at me with the most pissed off expression and then whipped around to owner and no joke screamed “WHY ISNT SHE WEARING OUR SHIRT”. This is a small, packed restaurant so literally everyone is looking. I panicked so I just grabbed the sushi and hurried off to the kitchen. I could still hear her yelling. I assume everything got smoothed over but the owner told me to be sure not to forget it next time and that she would get a spare just incase. 

So a couple Friday’s later that same couple was an hour late getting to the restaurant compared to when the usually do. Due to restaurant being so packed we had to seat people at the sushi bar in “their” seats. Needless to say the wife came in, obviously a little buzzed, and blew a gasket when she saw a guy sitting in “her” seat. First she started yelling at the waitresses and then she, no joke, went up to the man sitting their tapped him on the shoulder and screamed “This is MY SEAT! You need to MOVE!!”  Unfortunately, I didn’t get to see what went down after that but for the next few Fridays the husband came in without the wife. 

There probably wasn’t any sweet justice served to her but for the few weeks the husband came in without her, Friday nights went much smoother.This is my spot",TalesFromYourServer
"I don’t want to sound selfish- I know my comrades in grocery stores have it the hardest, but holy balls the AUDACITY of some people who continue to buy fast food. 

Although this pandemic has been stressful for most, I can speak for my co-workers when I say it is a relief that we don’t have to deal with as many assholes in our restaurants and Drive Thrus, and luckily still have a job (in my country at least). 

Despite this, we’ve had to cut a lot of labour so sometimes busy periods in DT hit harder and customers are still being dicks. Like we’re trying our hardest here!

But the main point of my rage is the fact that despite all the restrictions our PM and State Govt. have enacted, there are still people flaunting them and being dicks. 

Last Monday, for example, this Taxi pulls up to the DT with a drunk passenger who proceeds to spend 5 minutes giving his order, and then even longer at the payment window changing it. 

So I hand out this guys order and I’m mad. 

How the fuck do people think it’s okay to still being going out and getting drunk. Like I do not care what you do in the comfort of your own home, but the fact you are on a fast food run at 11pm is bullshit. It is people with entitled, “it will never happen to me” attitudes that are the reason this shit is spreading so quickly. 
(And i was ranting about this as soon as I closed the window FYI)

And then, when I think he’s left, my coworker goes to hand out the next cars order, but of course old mate hasn’t left yet.

So I have to go talk to him about how he’s missing nuggets (that he didn’t order), I ask him if he has money that I can take to put it through but he’s being stupid: “haha I thought you’d shout me nuggets”. All while the driver is rolling his eyes &amp; shaking his head at me. So I have to tell him, “look, if you’re not ordering anything you’ll have to leave, the car behind you is waiting on their food”

Now this made me think about a complaint we got from a customer who came through in a Taxi at like 1am Saturday morning. Who claims they ordered and paid for multiple meals but only received one, and when they asked about it were told ‘rudely’ to leave.

I would bet my left nut (if I had one) that this group of individuals came through the Drive Thru, intoxicated and being annoying, and were asked to leave for valid reasons. 

Why else would people be going to get fast food in a Taxi/Uber at 1 o’clock on a Saturday morning?? 

This complaint ended with threats of contacting the ombudsman, writing reviews &amp; telling potential customers about our poor customer service. 100% Karen behaviour if I’m being honest and total bullshit, can people please stop being dicks and cut us “essential” workers some slack, and for the love of Pete, STAY THE FUCK AT HOME.

So in summary, people who are not self-isolating and continuing to go out and get drunk piss me off to no end. Almost as much as people who think it’s their god given right to abuse (often teenage) fast food workers for trying to do their job. 

And if you’re drunk, just order freaking delivery, at least then the onus is on you and there’s solid proof!! 

TLDR; drunk fast food customers are dicks

EDIT// I originally posted this on r/trueoffmychest but the complaint got resolved a few days ago &amp; it made me mad so here we go

Pretty much, after reviewing the security footage, talking to the manager from that shift and realising everything I said was correct. My coworker calls the guy up &amp; asks for his side again, and he tells the story, but then proceeds to say “it’s not about the money, but the principle, the fact we were treated like LIARS”.

Like excuse you, YOU WERE LIARS. Drunken MFing liars who wanted free food or were confused about what you ordered. 
And my god he sounded like a prick on the phone.

But of course because we are a big ol MNC who love buttering up asshole customers, he is getting a free coffee for giving feedback. 
Hooray.The fact people are STILL going out &amp; getting drunk and harassing minimum wage workers",TalesFromYourServer
"I posted this on r/IDontWorkHereLady but I this this is also a good place for this. Sorry it’s so long but it’s worth it I think.

Recently found me a new job that I really enjoy. I worked both my old job at the restaurant and my new one for a while till I was able to fully start the new job. It’s been a couple weeks since I quit the restaurant and I went in to pick up my last check. They are doing to go orders only. Like a lot of places are doing right now. I went up to the cashier station and my friend was the only person working (and one cook) so I just started talking to her about what been going on and my new job and stuff while she she got my check from under the counter. 
The kitchen yelled “order up” that echoed through the whole empty restaurant so she went to grab the order and I stayed at the front waiting for her to come back. I was standing next to the cashier stand not behind it.

 A car pulled up and parked in front of the restaurant in a handy cap spot. And I noticed they didn’t have any stickers to park there. I recognized the lady from when I used to work here. She’s a total Karen bitch that every single person working here hated her. She always had many complaints and almost never tipped. She would come in with a group 2-3 more Karen’s and run the waitress around for 2 hours and then not tip. She even made a new girl cry one day. So I started to walk to the back to get my friend and so Karen wouldn’t say anything to me but she obviously recognized me from I worked here. Some of this is paraphrased because I was so angry I don’t remember exactly word for word.
 
Karen: screaming, red in the face “ I WANT A REFUND!! I’M SO FED UP WITH YOU ALL NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO YOU JOB”
  
Me: “let me get you someone to help” 

Karen: “No YOU will give me my money back right this second. I’m never coming back here again! That girl said she checked the order BUT ITS WRONG! I was here few minutes ago and ordered grilled catfish and there’s no tartar sauce in it!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT FISH WITH NO TARAR SAUCE. And I never got the Dr. Pepper I paid for“ she looked like she’s about to explode with anger. I was starting to feel angry too.

 Karen: “and I drove here TWICE ALREADY!! I WANT MONEY FOR THE GAS I WAISTED”

Me: “ok just let me go get someone to help you “ I will admit I said it in a snappy way. I do not appreciate anyone talking to me like that. She noticed and immediately started cussing me out and my friend came out from the back asking what happened. Karen starts yelling at her and I went to the back.
 
I quickly asked the cook for a tarter sauce while I made a dr. Pepper. I then walked back up to Karen she was still demanding a refund and $50 for gas. (There’s no way she used ($50 of gas) She’s insulting my friend and saying I was rude to her. I just want to say that what I’m about to do some of you might think is wrong but after working years in customer service and having to put up with little shits like her I saw this as once in a lifetime opportunity to finally give them a taste of their own medicine. I mean what are they going to do? Fire me? I don’t work there anymore. 

me:”nobody here fucking likes you. You are the biggest piece of shit I have ever met” she looked at me wide eyed frozen in shock. 

Me: “you really fucking think it’s ok to just come here and not tip??And then treat everyone like they are worthless!!  Why are you like this? Always such a NASTY attitude. Thinking you’re better than everyone? Im sorry your life is so fucking miserable that you constantly have to put others down. YOU ARE A FUCKING BITCH. Here’s you stuff you CAN SHOVE IT UP YOU ASS” I set the tarter sauce and the drink on the counter. Not going to lie I REALLY thought about throwing it at her. Then I just walked out with my check before she could say a word to me. Although I think she was stunned silent. No one probably has ever talked to her narcissistic ass like that before.

 I went home and started telling my boyfriend about and before I could even get a few sentences out the owner of the store is calling me. He wanted me to so apologize and I said no freaking way. So now I’m forever banned from going back there. My friend said that Karen threw the biggest fit after I left screaming for the manager and the owner and she almost called the police. Really happy I didn’t throw that drink at her now. I did feel bad for leaving her with that mess but she said she was thoroughly entertained by this situation. And she wishes she could’ve cussed her out to. I really wish I said more to Karen because on my way home I thought of all kinds of stuff I could’ve said. I think this has been building in me for a while and I finally snapped. Honestly I do not regret a single word I said to her

TL;DR I went to get a check from an old job and Karen comes in yelling at me. I don't work there any more so i cussed her out. It was very satisfying to me but now i'm banned.I finally snapped on a Karen",TalesFromYourServer

"I’m a server at a nice-ish seafood restaurant, and a manager at a children’s facility. Both furloughed me until further notice, and shut down. I barely started getting unemployment payments and have some savings, so I feel relatively safe... but... I’m terrified of going back. Everything is still uncertain, what if business is slow and I don’t make enough? What if the second wave hits and I get sick? 

Does anyone else fear this too? I’m seriously considering looking into getting out of the business, but I’m a student and I’m not really qualified for “safe” remote jobs. 

Please tell me I’m not alone in my anxiety!I’m afraid to go back when this is over. Anyone else?",TalesFromYourServer
Have any of your restaurants applied? My manager said they applied and is waiting for approval. I guess it’s supposed to let them put us back on payroll?

"My contract was set to expire on March 31st, the country I'm working in went into quarantine on the 13th.

"Server here, almost 20+ years working with customers, and I got throw into a pickle this afternoon.


4 days ago a local Italian deli/grocery store posts on instagram about once again preordering their famous ""sunday sauce.""  Picture shows someone ladling sauce into a container, about 6 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches tall, that has 4 meatballs and 2 sausages in it.  Hey, seems like a good idea, I got pasta here at my house and a fresh made meat sauce would be amazing!  


I call and order. ""Hey, I wanted to order some sunday sauce for pickup on Saturday.""  She mentions it comes with pasta, salad and bread.  Oh, this is a whole meal, so the price just went up, so this isn't really an savings for me, but it will be good, so why not.  I nicely tell her no salad, and she says I'm good to pick up at 2.


I get there, state my name and a nice reminder of no salad.  She has the look of shock.  ""Oh, someone with the same name just took yours, no salad, I ever read him the order and he agreed to it, I'll have to call him in a minute.""  Well maybe he didn't want salad either? LOL


She comes back with a MASSIVE bag and plops it on the counter with a thump.  My jaw sort of dropped, and I was about to say something, but she was already on the register...$55 plus tax.


Me: ""Um...I had just one order."" (I'm think the other me maybe had 2-3 orders, but now only left with 1 ,my order)

This is.

""How much food is it?""

It's a feast for a family of 4.

""Oh...ok""

What did you think it was?

""Well the instagram post just said sauce and showed sauce, so I thought I was gonna order just that, but when I called someone did say pasta bread and salad, but not that it was for a family of 4.""

Which post? (she grabs her phone, scrolls down like 25 posts to one from 2-3 weeks ago that did have all the details)

""I just saw the one from like 3 days ago, the little clip of the guy scooping the sauce over the meat, so I thought I was ordering that, like $10 or so, then when I called someone mentions the other stuff, so I figured I was then getting a whole meal, so like $20, but now for 4, I'm a single guy, just me.

So what do you want?

""Well I ordered this I guess.""

We can't sell you the sunday sauce sauce by itself, do you want just an order of our marinara sauce?

""I feel bad thought, I don't want this going to waste.""

Its fine, it won't, let me grab you our marinara sauce.



I paid the $6, and left very embarrassed.  I could have maybe dug more into their instagram account, but they also could have included all the details with each post about the sunday sauce.  I could have asked the price over the phone, but it wasn't a concern to me if it was $8 vs $14 as I wanted to support a local business, and then when I was told about pasta and bread, ok, I figured $20ish tops, but again, I'm supporting local, so whatever it is, I'll pay.


Just me making excuses, but the pasta, and bread, they sell alone, so they will probably just put those back, the only issue is the meat sauce, that they really COULD sell alone, but not the cashiers call, I understand.  Now if someone else asks about their sunday sauce, they can produce one more order vs being sold out. as a post last night said.


So...was I the Karen?Awww geez, was I the Karen? :(",TalesFromYourServer
"First off, I just wanna clarify that my title doesn't mean I'm depressed; it's just a jab at corporate because it's our motto.

Ive been a line cook at an order-at-the-counter style noodle restaurant for a couple months now and today was the longest 4 hour shift I've worked in my life. It started out fine, with a new hire I'll call alex running FOH, me and a coworker I'll call Sam running the kitchen, and the store manager,  who I'll call Emily. For about the first half hour, things were running smoothly. Ticket times were short, customers were happy, and Sam and I were getting through our orders with time to fuck around in between. Then, the rush hit.

Around 5:30 was the first wave. I was sauteing food just fine but didn't have enough time to clean the pans in between. Emily helpfully pointed out that if I used more oil, less food would stick. First crisis averted.

When the second wave hit I'd had time to clean off my station, Sam had gotten through dish, and we were feeling optimistic about the night. We were about to be metaphorically kicked in the face, bent over backwards and fucked like a hippie in the sixties: shamelessly and for all to see.

Now is also a good time to point out that it was about 100 degrees on the line and by 6, an hour in, I had gulped down a 32oz water and more than started on the limeade I replaced it with.

The first order of the rush came in and I was feeling good. I was armed with a new defense against carbonized food particles and greener than the emerald city, blissfully unaware of the utter destruction my mind and body were about to go through. Halfway through making the first dish,  another, bigger order came in. I nodded in acceptance and started cooking. More orders came in. I put my head down and pushed through my frustration, determined to cook with care.

After 20 minutes of constant orders, Emily came to help put together the dishes I needed to cook. Unfortunately poor Alex had never worked a real rush before so Emily went back up front to help her, leaving me to put together, broth and sauce 6 dishes at a time-which we never do; I'm pretty sure one person is only allowed to run 4 burners max because of how fast open flames cook food-and clean all the pans in between dishes. I can tell you right now it's not fun cooking over open flames in triple digit temperatures for two hours straight but this is just the beginning.

Up until this point, you're probably thinking this is just  me not having rush experience and this is normal, which you'd be right about. The problem is, the super moon must have come to our store a couple days late or something because shit is just about to hit the fan.

The first big problem was running out of zucchini. Roasted first, then ribboned. Sam and Emily made more and thought ut was solved, but it turned out to be the first of many shortages. From this point on in the night I don't think I had a full cooler once.

As this was all happening, the nasty customers started showing up. First it was flex guy, who walked in alone and ordered about $60 worth of food (4 very modified dishes). Once he received his order he went back into his otherwise empty car and drove off. I have no clue who he planned to feed or what happened to him after that.

Of course we have the regular entitled people who don't think the mask recommendation applies to them, but we had some that were just straight up stupid. My personal favorite was the guy who wore a mask up to our door and then took it off upon entering.

The worst customer we had, however, was a food delivery driver. It's important to note here that our bathrooms have been closed to the public for at least two weeks. This driver must have been new or something, because he tried to go around our very obvious wall of chairs and use them. Emily obviously told him he couldn't do that, which in his mind was a personal attack. He threatened to pee on our wall (and was promptly kicked out).

At this time-about an hour before our 8pm closing-we should have been starting to shut down what we didn't need and cleaning up after ourselves. In spite of everything that had gone wrong before, there was a lull in orders and we foolishly went into closing mode, shutting off the noodle cooker and minimizing our efficiency in favor of a shorter close. When the orders ramped back up I damn near walked out. At this point I'd been cooking for an hour and a half straight and had started a third drink due to all the heat. I was done.

Due to our pre-closing, I ended up effectively slammed for the rest of the night, but even this is not the end of the story, I'm afraid. To top everything off was a trifecta of terror:
1. Around 7:30 we started to completely run of ingredients. Unlike before, we didn't have more we could prep. Emily had to start calling and asking about substitutions. 
2. Because of the number of orders coming in and the sheer number of sauces I had to flip and put on ice, I couldn't get any real pre-closing done, which is never a good feeling
3. Not one, not two, but three people had the audacity to walk in 3 minutes before we closed and order 4 dishes. Even better it required ingredients I was out of so I had to open sauces after we closed.
Not a great night. 

After everything, another delivery driver called asking why he couldn't get in. The dumbass had waited on a pickup so long we'd been closed 10 minutes by the time he showed up. At this point I gave up and started closing what I could without having to think.

Fortunately for everyone Sam, my personal hero, had been running dishes the whole time so there wasn't a shift-sized mountain in the dish pit at 8. Given everything that happened, closing ran really smoothly. No one got breaks tonight but Emily said it was fine and she was planning on paying us overtime for putting up with everything. Overall, it was soul-destroying but extra money is always nice.We just had our busiest night since my city went to essential businesses only and I'm not loving life rn",TalesFromYourServer
"Hey folks, I was reflecting on life today and I was thinking back to past bar and server experiences, and I was reminded of the most uncomfortable experience I've ever had being hit on. I'm curious about all of your cringey, dangerous, or comical experiences with being hit on.

Having worked everything from cafes to upscale bars, I've had my share, but the one which stands out the most completely caught me off guard. I was 25, working at a cafe. Our clientele was a mixture of hipsters, uppity suburbanites, and private school kids: overall, a decent enough crowd (minus the college kids). While on one lovely September morning, in ideal 60 degree weather, I waited on a table with a sweet older lady and her two 12 year old granddaughters. Everyone was polite, but the girls were acting strange. They would giggle and look away when I would ask them what they wanted, and one of them would kind of blush whenever I tried to make eye contact with her. I'm not oblivious to these kind of things, but I shrugged it off as maybe they were just shy, or if they were attracted to me, no big deal cause young people hitting puberty is a thing. Service continues on as normally, and they tab out. At this point I was refilling a coffee carafe, and I felt my hand grabbed directly behind me. (Coffee carafes were located outside of the service area, close to tables, so civilians could unfortunately approach you). I was a bit startled and I turned around to see that one of the young girls had grabbed my hand. Being a mid twenties white guy with a face that screams serial killer is already a disadvantage in life; so, I certainly would not enjoy the extra attention of prepubescent girl making moves on me. I quickly turned around, and gingerly jerked my hand away. Not enough to be rude,  but enough to say, ""please don't touch me"". I felt a swell of nervousness at this situation. I never had a problem with immediately turning down the advances of the occasional barfly at the bars I had worked at, but trying to nicely and firmly leave the affection of an unknowing child is more difficult. Dont want to be rude, but definitely want to escape this extremely inappropriate situation as soon as possible. As I'm trying to think of what to say, the girl says, ""You're cute"". To which I replied, ""thank you. I have to get back to work now"". She kind of sighed and ran back to her table. I breathed relief because I was certain this was over. 

About fifteen minutes later, the elderly lady came up to me and said, ""well, I guess it's obvious that my granddaughters find you attractive. You could have at least told her that you thought she was cute too"", and then she left. I was flabbergasted. My only thought was, ""what the fuck lady? Are you so old that you reminisce about your childhood, during the colonial days, where creepy as fuck old dudes courted underage women""? It was definitely one of the most wtf moments of my life. I would love to hear from my other kitchen comrades for your horror stories now.The most uncomfortable you've ever been being hit on by a customer/co-worker?",TalesFromYourServer
"So obviously this is going to be on a throwaway cause I really don’t want to risk losing my job though I know I made the right choice.

Yesterday, I had the most outrageous start to my shift. I was really expecting it to a be a great shift, so I guess that’s where I went wrong.

For a little background, I’m a mere employee at a Corporate Italian restaurant and we have shifted to Take-Out/Curbside and Delivery only. Great, I’m gracious to still be working but I struggle with accepting that we are essential enough to stay open but whatever that’s a discussion for another day when TV ads start popping up stating, “Did you or a loved one worked during the Corona Pandemic? If so, you may be entitled to financial compensation. Please call this number, 555-5055.”

Anyways, we’re only like 10min into opening and we get a call from a lady (let’s call her Karen) asking to place an order over the phone for pickup. Okay no biggie. My coworker (let’s call her TG1) takes the call and order. According to TG1, Karen was bitchy the whole time. Since we are doing curbside and keeping it to minimal contact, TG1 asked for Karen for a tip in advance since we’re no longer asking customers to sign receipts. Karen responds with saying that her $58 order is already to much so she will not be leaving a tip for us. Okay, once again no biggie, we’re making bank with or without her tip. End of call with Karen.

Karen calls the restaurant again, and this time I pick up, she wants to make her pick-up order a delivery instead. Okay, no biggie we can do that since our delivery driver is in now. I proceed to ask her for her address and this is where the fucking shit hits the fan.

More background information. The county my restaurant resides in has over 400 confirmed positive cases. Not much but it is a small county compared to others in my state. In this county, there is a state supported living center which has been hit hard by Covid. In the facility alone, there has been 50 residents confirmed positive along with over 20 staff confirmed positive. The city that the facility and my restaurant reside in has 62 cases. So that’s a shit ton of cases confined in one facility. I know all this info because I’m trying to stay updated for my well-being and for the well-being of my homies. I’ve also read that this facility is doing a terrible job in handling the outbreak. To me, it seems like the facility is run by God-fearing Christians that believe only Jesus is the cure. They have no reported recoveries at all since their first case was confirmed. They’re forcing their staff to work with the bare minimum of PPE. And with the staff that have been confirmed positive, they’re still being asked to work! WTF why??? And god forbid those staff members speak up and tell their superiors they don’t feel comfortable working because they’ll only be met with being forced to quit or fired. Why do I say that? Oh because that’s exactly what has been happening to the staff that fear for their safety.

Back to Karen. I ask Karen for her address and she responds with, “this is for the \*enter facilities name here\*.” My immediate thought is “Oh shit, this is facility with so many cases.” I put her on hold because I immediately feel uncomfortable. I go to our deliver driver (let’s call her Adam Driver) and ask her if she’s aware of \*insert facility name here\* and she responds with “yes, and you’re not sending me there.” I haven’t even told her about Karen and her order. So I’m already like well shit. I tell Adam Driver that there is a customer wanting an order to be delivered to \*enter facility name here\* and she respectively responds with “NOPE.”

My next move is to go to the manager on duty (let’s call him Manager) and explain the situation. Y’know I really like this manager because he is hardworking and compassionate, but his only flaw is, he’s not really executive on decisions. Manager is still a huge improvement over previous ones we’ve had in the past. He just tells me that it’s okay and to tell Karen we can’t deliver to her because we don’t have enough drivers right now. Knowing this Karen and how Karen’s can be, I tell him that’s not a good enough response because Karen will probably ask for whatever delivery time works. So I straight up tell Manager that I’m going to tell Karen that I don’t feel comfortable doing her order as a delivery. So I go back to the phone to speak with her Karen and tell her exactly that I don’t feel comfortable nor does our driver feel comfortable delivering to her location given the amount of confirmed cases in \*enter facility name here\*. Of course, Karen is enraged with my response. She immediately starts telling me that the situation is not so bad and that the driver will be fine. She tells me that our driver only has to go to the gate and tell the guard what she’s there for. After our driver does that, she’ll be met by an employee to take the food. As of that morning, our restaurant was not equipped with any PPE except for gloves. But to Karen, it is fine exposing Adam Driver to two employees that could potentially have Covid just for a $58 order and no tip. I continue to tell her that we can’t deliver to her address, but I am more than happy to do it as a pick-up as originally planned. Karen responds with that she can’t do pick-up because she doesn’t have anyone to go pick it up. Really? Is it because you fired your employees that care about their health? Karen finally gives up and tells me to cancel her order. GLADLY! But y’know, I told her, “mam, if you would like, I can get your name and number so my General Manager can contact you when he can if you feel upset.” She rejects my offer and just repeats to cancel her order. I apologize to her again and tell her I hope she has a good day. End of phone call.

I spend about 5-10min vehemently ranting at the audacity this Karen had to think it’s a good idea to risk the lives of so many people for a $58 order of pasta. I know I made the right decision to protect myself and my team. I also texted my general manger right after ranting because I think it’s only fair that he has a heads up if she decides to escalate her rage to corporate. Who knows if Corporate has my back in all this. If they don’t and they decide to fire me, they better be expecting a lawsuit no matter how much it’ll cost. I’ll fucking drop out of school to sue their ass. I text my General Manager explaining everything and tell him I take full responsibility for my actions and intend to face all consequences that come of this. I apologized to him if this brings any trouble to our restaurant but I did not feel comfortable risking my team. My general manager is a great guy. He has defended me against corporate before in the past so I trust him to have sympathy on my decision. But y’know even the greats succumb to the corporate machine every now and then. My General Manager responds with “I understand your passion and concern...next time…any decision regarding rejecting any order is a manager call only.” Bullshit. I think that’s a fair policy if we were living under regular circumstances but we are not, we’re in a fucking pandemic for crying out loud! If I know more about the pandemic in our county than anyone in the restaurant, including my GM, I should have the right to make any decision in the interest of protecting my team. Yes, I’m protecting my team because my coworkers from FOH to BOH are like family… Hell some of them are actual family! But whatever, I should know my place as a mere employee. It’s okay. I truly believe I made the right decision to reject Karen’s delivery order and Corporate can suck it.

Since that happened so early into my day and I worked all day, I expected my termination to come anytime. I went all day without getting terminated and I don’t even know if I’m in the clear now. But I’m documenting everything because I like said, I’m ready to sue. But yea, that’s my rant about how a Karen attempted to spread Covid to my restaurant all for overpriced pasta and no tip.In hindsight, I should have insisted Manger to reject Karen’s order so it didn’t have to befall on a regular employee to do it but whatever. We are in unprecedented times and it’s time for me to make unprecedented actions.

TLDR: Stupid Karen wanted $58 worth pasta delivered to her location. Her location happens to have 50 confirmed positive cases of Covid with a current 0% rate of recovery. I, a mere employee, reject her order to be delivered. Karen is enraged that someone is willing to reject her delivery to a Corona infested Facility.The audacity some people have during this Pandemic!",TalesFromYourServer

"Hi All,

I know everybody is at different stages of grief or treading water trying to keep their restaurants afloat during this time, but I keep trying to think about what's next because inevitably this will end and people will be allowed to sit down in a restaurant again. When that is what that looks like is still up in the air but it will happen.

The leaders of our industry don't even know what is going to happen, Keller, Meyer, Katz, Chang, Humm are all kinda just throwing their hands in the air and a couple of them are preoccupied with lobbying congress for a relief package or suing insurance companies for not providing relief. There has been little to no talk about what will happen next and I am curious to hear what you all think

I personally think this is a hard reset for the industry and it is our opportunity to do the industry right and take a leap forward in the direction it's been heading for a while. I think this crisis will stop people with lots of money from investing in a restaurant just for shits and giggles because this has exemplified how fragile our ecosystem is. But I also think this will be the moment where we have the option of doing it right and paying livable wages for all staff BOH and FOH. I think high end/luxury hospitality is going the first to come back strong and should be the beacons of ""doing it right."" FOH is going to have a resurgence as being a respected job and not just a fall back job. I think there's going to be a bigger onus than there has been on recent history for FOH managers to create an environment both for guests and employees that is unique and memorable as there will be a new found appreciation for going out with people and enjoying life and not being so reliant on technology. That's not to say hospitality and technology can't coexist, they obviously have to and I think this ""hard reset will be a good time for the industry to finally take advantage of all the potential integration that exists with technology. Finally my final theory is that the food world will have a dramatic shift in it's geographic focus, I feel as though for the past year or two Los Angeles has been the focus of the food world (that could just be my perspective because I live and work here and it is very possible that it's an echo chamber) Where that new focus will be will have to materialize on it's own but I don't think it will be a major city...

"So I had previously posted about my trouble with my assistant manager here and now there are issues with the kitchen manager. She is one of the worst people I have ever met. Let me explain why and then I'll get into the shit that happened this week.

Just some background information. I'm the manager of the front of house at a fast-food restaurant and she is the manager of the kitchen. We'll call her Karen. No one likes working with Karen. You know when you see someone who is an asshole and you think ""I don't like them, but I can tell they have good heart""? Karen is not one of those people. When I see her, my entire body fills with dread and hatred for this woman. I've honestly boiled it down to narcissistic personality disorder.

Things that Karen has done:

* Karen yells and screams at people. If she's mad at one person, she yells at everyone. Even if you try to ask her a question when she's mad, she'll belittle you and call you stupid. But when she makes a mistake, she just laughs it off. I can't tell you the number of times I've had to comfort her assistant manager because she's crying and hurt by what Karen said.
* Edit: When she wants something. She's the nicest person in the whole world. It's very unsettling.
* Has little to no empathy for others. When you say you are tired, she doesn't give a shit. But when she is tired, she expects sympathy and for you to listen to her whilst she complains.
* Super controlling. I get that Karen is a manager but watching the cameras every second of the day and calling every 5 minutes to tell your staff to do something is ridiculous. She doesn't trust her staff at all.
* Don't even think about giving her feedback. She'll get super defensive and be pissy the whole damn week.
* Blames everyone. For everything.
* Karen thinks she's all that. Like she's the most important person in the world.
* Never shows up on time for work. Always at least 30-60 minutes late but gets angry when others are 5 minutes late. When our district manager was on vacation, Karen didn't even show up to two of her shifts. Saw her report for salaried hours and it reported that she worked her full 40 hours.
* Constantly tries to tell me what to do. Saying it's her store and I need her permission. For example, I was hiring new staff for the front. Karen said that I took too long doing interviews and I shouldn't take more than 5 minutes? She wouldn't let me hire anyone I called in to interview. She said ""another management needs to do the second interview"" and sits down with my candidates for less than 3 minutes before sending them on their way. I had this one girl who had a diploma in hospitality and was all smiles but Karen rejected her because ""she's not friendly"". She hired someone for my department without telling me and I ended up firing this person because of an attitude problem. It's such a waste of time and resources training someone who only lasts a month.
* Karen asked me to go to our sister store to pick up stock (about 30 mins away) which I don't mind doing. I asked her to watch the dining room and help my staff if they needed it because they wouldn't have a manager there. When I was about to leave after picking up the stock, my car wouldn't start so I was stranded at the sister store. I called her with updates every hour to tell her what I was doing to try and make it back as soon as possible. I even walked 30 minutes to the nearest hardware store to buy cables but it turns out it wasn't the battery, it was the starter. I had to wait until my dad got off work downtown (about 40 minutes away from the sister store) to come to pick me up. I ended up getting back to the store 4 hours after I left. Karen complained to the district manager that I was fooling around and took 4 hours because I didn't want to work. After I picked up the stock FOR HER.

There is so much more that she has done but I won't bore you with all of it. Now let's get into the total shitshow that happened this week.

I'm going to introduce another character: Karen's Assistant Manager. We'll call her Julia. She will come in later in the story.

One of Karen's responsibilities is to count stock so that we can track how much food is wasted and how much food is missing. She was off one day so the district manager asked me to do the count. Once I sent it in, I got a call from the district manager asking how it was possible we went through 5 boxes of meat patties in one evening. Turns out, Karen had been manipulating the numbers to make herself look good. She had been telling the district manager that the kitchen had no food waste.

A few days later, I found out that she told her kitchen staff to only fill the fries containers halfway. Karen told them that it was the ""proper portions"" but really it was to get to the right fries count by the end of the week. She also told my assistant manager to punch in 4 veggie burgers every shift and comp it but don't serve any. That way, by the end of the week, the veggie burger count will be perfect. So there's that.

So I'm working Wednesday evening and it is crazy busy. Only our drive thru is open because of COVID19. A customer wanted to buy a $100 gift card and when I tried to load the card after he paid (by credit card), it said could not load. The next thing I had to do is refund the $100, process the payment, and load the gift card on the inside till using cash. When I tried to process the refund, my till froze and a receipt printed saying refund not complete. I couldn't process the refund again because my till had frozen. The customer said he was in a hurry so I wrote down my name and gave him the receipt. I told him to check his bank statement in a few days and if it hadn't refunded, bring the statement to us and we'll refund it cash. He then gave me cash to ring up the gift card on the inside till and I sent him on his way. That night our money count was $95 over.

A few days later, the customer comes back with his bank statement and sure enough, $100 was deducted but non-refunded so I gave him a refund.

The next evening, I received a call from an irate Karen, screaming at me about how I was stupid and how I couldn't have given him the $100 without even asking her first. She asked me who I thought I was going off on my own and making decisions (I'm the same position as her???). I've never seen her yell like that before. Karen was yelling about how she has more experience than years I've lived, not that it matters. She's still a shitty manager and person. Karen told me that because Julia was working with me, we both had to give her $50. Karen then accused me of pocketing the money. She said ""no one saw you give it to the guest. How do I know if you actually gave it to them or if you just took it for yourself?"" I hung up the phone because I was beyond done with her.

The next day, I brought it up to the district manager and we checked the money count for the week. We were over by around $2 both days. There was no money shortage. She probably would have kept the money for herself if we had given her the $100. I have no clue what kind of corrupt shady-ass operation she's running in the kitchen but I don't intend to stick around long enough to find out. Just waiting for the COVID19 situation to improve so I can get the out of this hellhole.

**TL/DR** the kitchen manager is a narcissistic asshole who is doing really shady stuff at me restaurant and makes everyone cry.Really shady business from the insane kitchen manager",TalesFromYourServer
"I used to work in an independent champagne/cocktail bar that offered afternoon teas available through pre-booking. The bar was Alice in Wonderland themed, so the afternoon teas were made really cute with lil sandwiches and cakes dressed up to look like a little garden, really nice. This was the only food we offered though.

We get a booking in for 12 people, it's a 17yo girls birthday celebration, pretty standard for us, but the guests had the option to have their afternoon tea with bottomless prosecco for about $20 extra per person, so I needed to be careful that the birthday girl didn't have any prosecco as it would be against our license. In my country, the legal drinking age is 18, but in restaurants whose licenses allow for it, 16-17yo's can have one alcoholic drink with a meal. My place, being only a bar and not a restaurant, didn't have that kind of license tho, so I made sure the girl didn't get a glass when I served the prosecco. 

Her dad takes issue with this. I explain about our license, and that if I serve his daughter alcohol I'd be breaking the law. He asks to see my manager, who I get and says the exact same thing as me. Manager leaves. This guy then necks his glass of prosecco and goes 'fill it up again, make sure it doesn't go empty.' I smile and say of course and top him up. This party is in our function room, which is on the floor above the bar. He tells me to come up every 4 minutes to make sure everyone's glass is full. I go up exactly every 4 minutes for about an hour while they eat, they all get drunk and stomp around and the middle aged women are trying to twerk (theres a security camera in the room they're in, which I check to see if they need top ups, and I just see these old women making complete fools of themselves. Not even funny, just cringy) and one of the women keeps making comments about my ass. Dont know if that's harassment, but made me feel v uncomfortable.

 It's a quiet day so not many customers other than them. But later on I get 5 walk-ins. I seat them, they already know what they want, so i make their cocktails and serve them, all good (it's only me and my manager on). I check my watch and, oh shit, I'm a minute late to top up the party's glasses upstairs. I grab the prosecco and rush up. The dad is coming down the stairs to get me, I apologise and say I was just on my way up. He takes me aside and tells me if there aren't 2 bottles of prosecco on his table in the next minute he'll give us a bad TripAdvisor review, and that it was ridiculous that the service is this bad for the money he's paying. I've been busting my ass off for about an hour trying my best to make sure they're ok. It took everything I had not to say what was on my mind to this prick, but i say of course sir, very sorry sir, and get him his bottles. At least i dont need to keep refilling the prick's glass and endure his sexually frustrated wife.

A few hours later the whole party comes downstairs for cocktails, they left the function room looking like a bomb had gone off, sandwiches they didn't like all over the floor. I'm called over to their tables with a finger snap. Fucking LOVE IT when that happens. He orders a round of cocktails, no please, no thank yous. I'm still going 'yes sir, of course sir' etc, and the women try to grab me and shit at one point. I bring the drinks, no thank you (apart from the 17yo who thanks me for her mocktail). Another hour and 3 more rounds, and all the adults are wasted and being loud and annoying and the girl looks miserable. I go over to ask if they want any more drinks, and the dad waves his credit card in my face. 'Of course, sir.' I get the card machine and get a bunch of comments about how over-priced it is (they had 12 bespoke afternoon teas, 8 bottles of prosecco, and twice as many cocktails, so of course its gonna be pricy. Plus what the fuck do you expect me to do about the fucking price?). After he pays he says to his daughter 'shame you couldnt have a drink, eh?' I must have been visibly furious because he looks at me and doesn't say anything else. They finally leave, they were there for about 3 1/2 hours. The only thanks I get is from the girl, who also apologises for her dad. I just nod, I'm on the verge of tears at this point, I'm way past anger. I had a little cry in the back after they left. 

Theres such a noticeable divide between people who've worked in hospitality and people who haven't, you can tell almost instantly. These fuckers, apart from the girl, were all between 40-55, and were acting like children. They had no respect for me, my bar, the food that had taken hours to prepare, or for their daughter, who's birthday they were celebrating, who apologises to me for her PARENTS behaviour. I've never been so disrespected in my life. Disrespected to the point of tears.

"Not too crazy, but definitely one of my worst customers.

This happened a few years ago in college. I worked at a food place on campus where I mainly made pizzas and calzones. This woman wanted a calzone. I begin making it, but she happens to be one of those people who watches you like a hawk while you make food just to make sure you 'get it right'. She has her hands overtop the protective glass, you know, the glass that protects all the food from people's germs.

She also happens to be one of those people who wants to get the most bang for her buck, i.e., she keeps asking me to fill her calzone with more and more and more chicken, to the point where I have to go to the back fridge and get more chicken just to fulfill this customer's needs. The calzone is about to burst, but I put it into the conveyor belt oven anyway.

While waiting for the calzone to come out, this customer asks me to take it out now. I tell her I can't, a) it has to cook, b) I don't want to burn myself, and c) I can't even really reach in to grab it (conveyor belt ovens are like that). She is adamant though, very forcefully asking me to take it out over and over. Once the calzone is at a point where I can actually take it out without burning myself, I finally do just to please her.

The final step in making these calzones is to pour a little seasoning on top - what we do for all calzones. When she sees this, she yells at me that she didn't want the seasoning. I tell her it that's how all our calzones are made, but I can brush off the seasoning or make a new one for her. She immediately 'gives me the hand' and goes straight to my manager (standing nearby) to complain.

Fortunately my manager is super chill and tells the customer that the other guy I was working with can make a new calzone. That seemed to calm her, but every time I tried to help my fellow employee make this entitled woman's calzone (i.e., giving him ingredients, etc.), she would shout for me to back away! Like my aura would get her order wrong! Not only that, but she was very loudly explaining to her friend who just came in about how we screwed up her order - while we were making her a new one!

"So this happened way before everything shut down because of the virus. For some background information, I work as a hostess at a very popular burger place and we get quite busy on Fridays and Saturdays during the night shift. At this location we only have 5 hostesses that work there (thats including me) and we were all working that night. But this happens a lot where all of the other hostesses leave the host stand and I'm stuck there to man the front door. I can usually handle a busy night by myself, I have been working there for almost 2 years now, so if the customers are being cooperative I can handle it. So at this point not a lot of people were coming in and I have been at the host stand for about 20 minutes and the phones rings. The conversation that follows: (not word for word)

Me: Hello thank you for calling, how can I help you?

Lady: Hi I would like to do call ahead seating

Me: alright how many is in your party

Lady: 3

Me: Can I get a name?

Lady: Yes its \_\_\_\_\_\_, 

Me: And a cell phone number

Lady: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, how long is your wait?

Me: It's about 20 to 30 minutes

Lady: Ok, so if I come in in about 20 minutes are we going to be sat right away?

Me: No your wait time starts when you arrive at the restaurant, the call ahead only saves you a spot on the waitlist, so when you get here it could be 5 minutes or 20 minutes

At this point, I have been talking to this lady for about 5 minutes, I'm still at the host stand by myself and there is a long line out the door and I know that if I continue to talk to her more people are going to come up to complain about it being cold and my manager who can see the host stand keeps on notifying people their table is ready and I have been nice this entire time but I lose my cool the more she keeps talking

Lady: What no I can't wait that long, I have a toddler A TODDLER

Me: I'm sorry but that is our policy

Note, we are a family restaurant so there are lots of families with little kids running around and making messes. Like, if you want to go out with your hubby, get a babysitter, give the kid to grandma or if you can't handle your toddler out in public wait until you can control him. 

Lady: No you don't understand I really cant wait that long, I have worked in this industry for 4 years I know what a call ahead is

I have had enough at this point

Me: Listen, I have you down on the wait list, if you decide to come in great, but I'm the only one at the host stand right now and I have people that need to be sat

Lady: ........

Me: Hello?

Lady:.....

Me:....... Ma'am \*hangs up\*

At some miracle, all of the hosts show back up for some reason and I need to leave the host stand to cool down, I ended up crying int he bathroom (not the first time). Then the to go person comes up to the host stand and said that one of the hosts were getting in trouble. She then explains that a lady called and was saying that I was rude and hung up on her and that our call ahead policy is wrong and she is right and a bunch of other bs. Thankfully, the manager that was there was the cool manager, I asked him what the lady said earlier and he didn't even tell any of this to my GM who is satan herself. But he said that I was right and he told the lady our policy and that if someone is being difficult on the phone to transfer them over to a manager.

If y'all don't know the difference between a reservation and a call ahead waitlist, a reservation is when you call ahead of time and reserve a TABLE (we don't do this unless its a big party between 8-60 people, yes we've had parties with 60 people) and a call ahead is when you call ahead that day and reserve your SPOT ON THE WAITLIST.

I have many other stories, so if you liked this one I might right more.

Also, hope everyone is doing ok, staying healthy and positive during quarantine.I can't wait that long I have a TODDLER",TalesFromYourServer
"7 years ago I worked at a very popular chain restaurant that, as you may have guessed, has beans as a side option. Black beans, to be precise. Its a busy weekend night,  I've got like 8 tables. A family of 3 was in the booth in the corner, a son about 12, and nice, soft spoken parents. Like, I could see the dad (who will forever be known as Bean Guy) working in an accounting department, that kind of vibe. It was hyper focused trying to keep things flowing during the rush, so I was happy about this table, thinking they weren't going to need anything besides the basics.  The important thing to know for this story is that all 3 of them ordered black beans as the side with their meal. We have a food runner, so a bit later as I'm going to greet a table, I see they've gotten their food. I stop by real quick to ask if they needed anything else, assuming they are going to say no, since I can see they have everything they should need. 

Instead, Bean Guy looks up at me with this look of pure consternation, and says in a mystified voice ""Its the *strangest* *thing* "" So, of course, I ask what is so strange and he tells me ""ALL of the beans are COLD"". It was as if he was telling me all the beans tasted like strawberries. Like.. what? Took everything I had not to laugh. I understand letting me know about cold food, but it would be much stranger if only some had been cold, since then it would seem like some were fresh and some were not. His presentation of the information is hilarious, but at the time I was also semi annoyed because i had a table to greet and I didn't want to deal with cold beans at all, let alone his confusion about them. Either way, I apologized and let him know that they must not have heated the entire batch of beans well enough in the kitchen initially, and assured him that his family hadn't been served old food. Got them some out that were nice and hot, and I'm thinking that this will be the end of the bean discussion. 

Apparently I was wrong. Maybe 5 minutes later, I've got my hands full and am headed to another table when I notice Bean Guy flagging me down rather urgently. I have to go to my other table first and drop off their stuff, and by the time I get back he looks very flustered and confused again. I ask what I could help with, and he says ""Well, can you explain, please... why are the black beans brown?"" Alright, I'm gonna be honest. This one broke my brain for a moment. I stared at him for like 8-10 seconds trying to process this whole bean situation. I just... didn't really even have an answer to that question that didn't seem rudely obvious to point out.. Google would have done a better job, maybe. But I just said something how when things cook/mush up a bit their color can change, and that's how our beans always looked, and then escaped as quickly as possible. They left soon after, without any more incident, but the tale of Bean Guy has become one of my favorites to tell. Who has that much confusion about beans?!The Bean Guy",TalesFromYourServer
"I just need to vent and share this ridiculousness. So, I work in a restaurant. I still have my job, thankfully. The owner of the restaurant travels often out of state and comes back later this week. He’s most likely not going to self isolate when he comes home either. We all think he should since he’s in poor health, but being the person he is, he won’t. 

While he was gone, this past weekend, one of my coworkers decided to start doing curbside only for obvious reasons. On our busiest days, customers would gather too closely together at the entrance waiting to pay or to receive their food. It was too chaotic and no one was distancing themselves. 

So Saturday we’re doing curbside and delivery only and it’s going great. People are happy that we’re doing that and taking measures to protect them and us. Everything goes smoothly. Most payments are done with card through phone. The only people coming inside are those paying cash. 

Then, the owner finds out and throws a huge fit. He’s yelling and cursing at the two employees that are kind of like next in charge when he’s away.

So, his whole reason for getting angry at the curbside thing is because he doesn’t want people paying through mostly credit card transactions. He doesn’t want to pay the increase in credit card fees and all that other stuff that comes with card transactions. But he also doesn’t like curbside for other reasons I’m not aware of. I just know he doesn’t like it. 

I understand it’s his business and whatever he says, goes. But really? -_-


Yesterday, we switched back to allowing customers inside. So now, if they ask if they can come inside, we just “we can bring it out to you if you prefer, but you can come inside too.” We had one lady do curbside pick up and the owner’s wife didn’t like it. She was like, tell her she can come inside. Like what??? No. If that’s what they want, FOR SAFETY, I’m not saying no. 


It’s just frustrating to see him not taking this seriously and being more concerned with money. But in his defense, maybe he just doesn’t know how to handle this since this is a new situation for a lot of business owners. We’ll see what he says when he comes back and hopefully, he’s willing to listen to our concerns. I even suggested to his wife that we could put signs up or markings on the ground. But she doesn’t want to do anything yet until he returns. 

What do you guys think? Maybe someone can help me see this from a business perspective. 

I’d love to hear your stories too right now of any virus craziness your restaurant is dealing with. 

TLDR: Owner doesn’t like curbside pickup for own monetary gain/ignorance. 


UPDATE/CLARIFICATION 

Didn’t expect to get this much feedback. Thank you for your support. 

The owner is mad because 1) A coworker went behind his back to make the restaurant curbside only without at least telling him. Understandable. 

2) More curbside means more CC payments. He is worried about increase in CC payments and it being taxed. Less money for him. 

3) Due to the increase in CC payments, our cash register is almost always negative (apparently, he gets really pissed off when he’s high in the negatives) and he needs to withdraw money from his bank account every day now in order for us to collect our tips. I’m pretty confident no one is stealing, but he probably gets paranoid. Idk. 

Curbside is not mandatory in our state yet, so until it is, he won’t probably won’t force it, but we will do it if customers don’t want to come inside. So, pick up and delivery only unless the governor says otherwise. 

Most of us are wearing gloves and masks at all times and will continue to do so. 

In the meantime, I’m still going to try to find a new job. It’s time to move on.Need to vent. Owner and his wife don’t know how to handle business during the coronavirus.",TalesFromYourServer

"So I’m fairly bored in quarantine and intoxicated and feel like talking so thought I’d share my first large party here. 

I’m 23, male. live in SoCal, and attend school full time (getting my bachelors next year).  Hospitality jobs are by far the best paying with little to no real experience, so I worked my way from dishwasher-busser-bartender/server in a span of about 3 yrs.  I’ve only been bartending/serving for about 6 months now, and 2-3 weeks into the job I was ready for large parties. 

So it was around 20 ppl total, check around 600, with booze and appetizers.  At my spot, it’s always busy, with 5-6 table sections, moneys pretty good.  It was my first large party so ofc I was pretty nervous, and did not take any more tables whatsoever, gave them my full attention.  Running back and forth, bringing refills, etc. 

It’s one of their birthdays, okay.. so I’ve always been sort of an anxious person, but I’ve learned to break my shell through working in hospitality.  I couldn’t find any help to sing with me, so I just went solo assuming the table would help me sing.  Out of 20 ppl not a single person sang, which made it 10x worse, they all just pulled out their phones and recorded.  

Whatever, so after the bday song they check out fairly quick on the presto table top machine and leave only a $20 cash tip on $600, which I tip out 1.5% total sales to bussers and 1% to the bartenders, so basically made nothing in the 2 hrs I tended to them, where I probably could’ve turned at least 6-7 smaller tables in that time.

Tbh, I don’t mind being stiffed, it’s part of the hustle, but to this extent was mind baffling; Don’t have another individual chaperone your party if your not going to pay them accordingly.

My managers have been trying to implement a auto grat on large parties for awhile, but supposively its hard to enforce since I work for a corporate restaurant.

Since then, when it comes to the large parties I have to take, I sort of get there drinks out and orders in and let them be from there on out.  Taking other tables, maybe checking in on them before the food is out and once after it’s out.  It seems that the level of service has no affect on how much people tip when it comes to the larger parties.  How do you guys treat the larger parties?

"I wasn’t the server, but I thought some of you might appreciate this story.

A few years ago, I was at a company Christmas party, which was held in a ballroom of a hotel. There was an open bar, and while the majority of us remembered this was a work sponsored event, there was one co-worker (CW) who had to be cut off. This was brought to everyone’s attention when he bellowed at the bartender, “DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!”

For the record, we basically had the same job title. He did have more responsibilities than I did, but without the pay increase or title. 

While my co-worker was glaring with all the certainty of someone who genuinely believes he has the upper hand, the bartender called out in an equally loud voice, “Excuse me! May I please have everyone’s attention? I have a man here who does not know who he is. If you can help to identify him, please come to the bar.”

This only further enraged my co-worker. At this point, however, one of the owners came to the bar in tears because he was laughing so hard. 

He jokingly confirmed CW’s identity to the bartender before firmly, but still humorously, telling CW, “I think you’ve had enough to drink, don’t you?”

CW backed off after that. He didn’t get fired (my mind is still boggled by this!), and he would get so mad whenever anyone hinted at this incident.Do you know who I am?!",TalesFromYourServer

"Not my story, but my coworker’s. Also sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.

So as a little bit of background, the restaurant I work at isn’t in the best area of the city. It’s also a local business so the restaurant is not that big. Usually at busy hours there’s two servers and off hours there’s only one.

This particular evening was quite busy and both servers had their hands full with all the customers. That is when this lady walks in and goes straight to the bathroom. My coworker (let go with Max and Sarah as nicknames for them) noticed this but decided that the customers were of greater cause. 
Finally about maybe 30 min to an hour later the commotion died down and most (if not all?) the customers left. That’s when my coworkers realized they forgot about the lady who went to the bathroom. (I should also note these bathrooms are single rooms and shut only by a door) So Sarah decides to knock on the door and ask how they are doing ok in there.
The lady responds “oh yeah I’m alright” 
At this point Sarah is doesn’t know what to do because the restaurant is closing soon and she’s locked herself in the bathroom.  So Sarah tells Max this and Max in turn tells the kitchen. Our kitchen staff also consists of only 2 cooks who alternate with another 2 cooks. The chef today was just a small old lady. Who proceeds to take her broom and knock on the door with it telling the lady to get out.  
Eventually she does, and boy she is PISSED. She runs into the middle of the restaurant and starts cussing. She says something along the lines of “You guys are all retards!”  She’s also screaming and making a scene. (Good thing at this point no customers are in the restaurant).  And almost immediately runs out of the restaurant. Max tells Sarah to check the bathroom while they close the till. (Which is a job only Max can do). To Sarah’s horror she finds: a belt on the sink counter (probably for heroin), pills in the drain, and traces of weed in the bathroom. 
Poor Sarah sanitized that washroom like no tomorrow. 
I’m not sure if a police report was ever filled out or if they remember her face enough to give one since she ran out. Definitely something not a fun experience

TLDR: customer locks themselves in bathroom and is forced out by yelling chef. Customer screams and runs out of store. Coworkers find a bunch of drugs inside the bathroom.

"So we currently have our menu posted both outside our building and inside on the wall to prevent people from touching it. Had one guy walk by looking at the menu, I go check on him to see if he had any questions or wanted to order. He straight up tells me he isn’t going to buy anything but had was wondering if we changed our menu recently. I told him he we hadn’t changed it in many years. He starts arguing with me about the menu and how he couldn’t get a certain combo before about a year ago and how we must’ve changed the menu. We go back forth for a bit and he seems to get upset. He finally admits that he was mistaken and was referring to another menu item. 

Cool I thought, this argument was pointless now we can both go on about our day since you aren’t buying anything. Nope. He says he was actually talking about a different combo and was wondering why he can’t get it without one of the items. That he got into a disagreement with someone before here because he couldn’t get the combo how he wanted. I apologize not knowing the extent of the story and I’m ready to make things right until I ask him what exactly was the issue. 

So he wanted to get a certain combo, Chile relleno (stuffed pepper dipped in whipped up eggs and flour then fried), cheese enchilada, with rice and beans but he didn’t want the enchilada. Could he do that, he asked. I said he could but it would be the same price as what made that dish that price was the mostly Chile relleno and the enchilada was free. If he ordered each item individually it would be more expensive because combos are priced to make each item cheaper. I could give him the combo price but removing the free item wouldn’t lower the price.  He got pissed off and started going off on me about not wanting to pay for something he wasn’t getting. He didn’t understand the concept of a free item. Went back in forth again for a few minutes. 

I was about ready to just walk away and ignore him when he finally gave up and said “I’ll never eat here”.

I responded, “I guess you won’t” then I dropped my mic and walked away. Not really, but I was glad to stop trying to convince someone that you can’t get at discount on an item that’s free.I’m not going to buy anything",TalesFromYourServer

"I work fast food, normally we do collect and delivery. Now is only delivery and cashless. Here are our most popular questions.

1. Are you open? No we arent. I directed the phones to my home phone just to hear you complain. 

2. Are you offering collection? You just walked past an A3 sign on the door saying cashless delivery only. So yes we are offering collection, just not to you. 

3. Do you take cash? Sure, we want your germ infested money so we can put other people at risk moron. 

4. The app says delivery only, can we come and collect? Well i suppose the app is just a guideline, not for anyones safety to be honest. 

And our most popular complaints

1. Why cant you just offer collection? Its fucking stupid - i know, how dare my company care about its workers health. Bastards. 

2. Why is my pizza taking so long when everyone should be self isolating? Are you idiots?. - absolutely, we clearly all have 8 arms but choose to make the other 20 orders really slow just to piss you off.

3. Why did you leave my pizza on the step? Thats not hygienic. - im sorry, the floor is currently cleaner than whatever the fuck youre carrying. 

Lastly, my two best REAL complaints this week. 

1. You sent me the wrong pizza, i ordered a margherita pizza and i got a cheese and tomato......wtf do you want me to do. I cant call you an idiot over the phone. 

2. Take this chocate pizza back, it isnt what i ordered. 
Me - but your order says you ordered the chocolate pizza.

Me- looking at the pizza base with nutella on top thinking 'oh right, silly me its clearly a chicken pizza'In answer to their questions",TalesFromYourServer
"So my fast food restaurant is still open for delivery and drive thru. There are something’s that I do not understand:

1. a)The fast food company I work at is running a free drink promotion. As long as you have an empty spot on a stamp card, you can have it free. Any size. Mobile orders can have a free drink every day. No limit. What a great way to get people to physical distance. Have everyone flock to the restaurant and sit outside with each other. 

1. b) Customers who have used all 10 free drinks and get angry when you won’t give them more free stuff so they hold up the line and threaten to cough in your face. 

2. We are not allowed gloves because “it’s not foodsafe” but we are handling cash so...

3. Because of this, we have to wash our hands every time we touch cash. Every. Fucking. Time. My hands have started bleeding. Still no gloves (even though I think blood is less foodsafe than gloves). My best guess is that the owner doesn’t want to have to pay for them. 

4. The district manager isn’t ordering enough stock, food or serving materials, even though our sales are about the same as they were before the pandemic. This results in me driving 20-50 minutes to our sister stores to pick up stuff we need. Like ketchup packets or drink cups. 

5. I’m often the only one scheduled to serve people which may sound fine, but we often have 5 car lineups on drive thru, 4 person lineups at the take out window, and a few delivery orders. 

Here is what I’m expected to do: take the drive thru order, take the take-out order at our separate take out window, punch in and pack the delivery order, take the payment for drive thru and take out, wash my hands, make coffee, pour drinks, pack all the orders, check for accuracy of special orders, and sanitize everything it touch in the restaurant. 

All of this whilst maintaining a serving time of under 75 seconds per order. 

5. Customers keep touching my hands whilst I hand them drinks and take payment

6. Customer coughing and sneezing in my direction

7. Customers grabbing the whole ass debit machine to tap their card in stead of JUST TAPPING THEIR CARD. 

at the end of the day, I want this all to be over so I can find a different job or get laid off so I can claim the benefits. We’ll see. Thank you for listening.

"I can’t believe I haven’t posted this yet.

This happened before there was even any talk of quarantine, but everyone was still panicking.

I was at work (an Italian restaurant) and this regular customer comes in (sweet old lady) with her son and his wife. The regular customer is a chatterbox and sometimes won’t shut up (I mean that in the nicest way possible lol) but she means well.

She was talking to me and introduced me to her son and his wife. We were all talking and she started talking about the Coronavirus. Her son turns to me and says,

“You know, it’s not the Italians who *ruined* your country, it’s those *Chinese*.”

It was so hard not scream at him.

I calmly said, “Well I guess I ruined America then. I’m a quarter Chinese.”

Everyone’s face at the table turned red. The regular customer asked, “You are?” I said, “Yes. My mom is half Chinese, and my grandma is full Chinese, and they were the ones who raised me.”

The guy didn’t say a word. The regular customer pulled me aside later and apologized for her son. I know it’s not her fault, she would never say anything like that, she’s close to the owners and a very nice woman. But I much would’ve rather had her son apologize.

"My restaurant shut down, takeout and delivery only, about 3 weeks ago. I’m getting paid through another job that’s closed until May, so I didn’t want to take shifts from my coworkers, but boss called asking for help and I went in last weekend, made $200 in 2 nights. Last night, I’m running to cars, taking orders, the whole ordeal. Our phones are going crazy, we have 30 cars for curbside and only 6 spaces, kitchen is bustling, and I got a surprise. My favorite regulars pull up to order, hang out and watch me run around like crazy, and tipped the bill! I was floored, and so touched that they’d been concerned about me. I got them all the special things I do when they come to my section, and they told me they’d be back next weekend. Not 10 minutes later, another regular family came by, asking all about my jobs and family and situation, and tipped 50%! I’m so blessed to have a few truly wonderful regulars, and you better believe I’m gonna spoil them when we reopen. 
Another heartwarming moment of the evening was two of our daily bar regulars coming at the same time, getting takeout, and sitting 6 feet apart to eat and catch up outside. The bartender was bagging orders but took her break to bring their food out, and I overheard “it’s so good to see you, I would love to hug you but I cannot.” It was absolutely adorable, and they each tipped the bill as well.

"I used to have these 2 older guys who came into a fantastic place I worked in a small town. Every single Wednesday for over a year same table, same order, same bottle of wine and their conversation was logistics basically. Boring stuff. Nice enough but just very routine. Hardly any small talk after a  waiting on them 52 Wednesday nights straight. They left 15% so mathematically correct it was almost annoying. 

One night I was talking to the owner about how I they just talk boring numbers nothing exciting ever, and I told him but man you gotta appreciate them though-they are more reliable than anyone I have ever met. I suggested after over a year we put their bottle of wine on the house and he said put the whole check on the house and thank them for being the most reliable table we have.

They were surprised and really appreciated it. 

So I had a very very classic Honda CB 750 motorcycle in incredible shape always parked out front and the chef, my best friend of my life, always had his motorcycle and there were friends that stopped by on theirs.

I bought a really nice new v twin sport bike and it was were my old bike used to be and we were all talking about it.  Low and behold these two leave me over $200 cash tip. I was floored. Their exact words-""Well you just bought a brand new bike so we figured you could use the cash for your bank account.""

So LSS as they were both pilots who owned an air freight company and they met every week in our all town in between 2 larger cities to have their weekly business meeting. Logistics. 

They knew alot about engines and motorcycles. So I  got to know them and then one of them starts telling me stories about racing motorcycles in the 60s in Europe. He really knew a lot about bikes but also about specific racetracks in Europe. I asked HOW were you racing in Europe?

""Oh I grew up with Ali McGraw my entire life as really close family friends."" So I was her privatle pilot and then Steve and I became really good friends when they started dating so I flew him everywhere and we raced bikes and cars together for years.
I literally asked him about a specific race Steve was in and he said oh I was there but I met a French girl and we left before the race even started and rode all over Europe together for several weeks and Steve couldn't find me. I was dying laughing. The most boring table ever had raced Moto Guzzis with Steve McQueen in Europe. He had wrecked at 100 mph and walked away.  He was the most laid back, humble, but all business kinda normal guy I had ever met. I asked about Ally and he said I still see her several times a year.

"Because the first cases of the virus was in my area, I resigned in early March. I finally connected with some previous coworkers, and apparently the next day their shifts were all cancelled via their app without a word.

Not a single word from management.

Almost a month later, a server got two shifts this weekend to do to-gos. There have not been any official layoffs despite our stay at home order extended til May 4th (Yes, I've made the joke already. I don't think the force will be with us, unfortunately.)

I have worked on and off for this company since 2004. How fucking shitty of them. This is what's holding my unemployment back. They are holding on for one or two to-go shifts to be assigned per month, and even though I resigned I'm still an active employee.

We have the expected full spectrum of regulars: the extremely kind who tip very well, all the way through the straight up assholes. In one day I experienced both ends.

For the good end, a regular has been reaching out to me for almost a week on facebook to find out when specifically I am working. Wanted dinner and some beer, and I was working last night. He calls in his order and comes to get it 5 minutes til closing. His check was just barely over 20 bucks, he slaps a small folded stack of 20s down on the counter and tells me to keep the change. An absolute legend.

On the not so good end, longtime regular who has been a pain but tips okay. Calls in their order, I have everything ready, everything is perfect. They pay with their card and almost didn't fill out the merchant copy, so I just reminded them I needed it filled out. They signed, and while zeroing out the tip line looked up at me and said stone cold ""It's only carryout"" before grabbing their stuff and leaving.

Here's the thing, usually I'd be okay with that. I have never expected tips on carryout, though they were nice to get. However, I'm not saying to tip me, I just need your slip filled out. That paired with the audacity of your statement? I'll see you in like a month probably and might favor the guy who tipped 400% getting another beer over you getting another beer.

"I want to start by saying I’ve been lucky enough to continue working during this difficult time and I’m very appreciative of that. I work in New Hampshire, and for the past two weeks we’ve been limited to takeout/delivery only. I normally receive an hourly wage plus tips when I work takeout. But, my employer decided last week he wanted us to punch in at our server wage ($3.27 an hour) to work the position due to the increase in tips. He has used it as an opportunity to schedule more BOH staff, and since doing so he does not give us breaks. Instead it looks like we are working full time, but in all actuality we are not. In addition to having us punch in as servers, he is having us claim our cash tips under our punch in number yet all of our sales are under the takeout number. The entire thing feels pretty shady, and I’m honestly not sure about the legality of it. He’s also been very odd about the staff filing for unemployment, he posts messages that they’re able to hire people back despite a lack of available hours.

"Hello everyone. Like many of us, I have been laid off my job and filed for unemployment in Illinois. I filed on the 25th of March. When I was done filling out my application, it gave me a list of “next steps” to do, like upload a resume (which it said to click on a giant orange button that wasn’t even available on the page), to enroll in direct deposit or wait until a debit card comes (I enrolled in direct deposit) and to certify bi-weekly for benefits. 

I was under the impression that after they received my  application, they would email me listing a final number I would be receiving instead of the one that was estimated at the time of filling out the application. I have not received any email so far about anything regarding unemployment, except for my confirmation of enrolling in direct deposit so I know I typed my email address in correctly. I also am not sure if I need to certify for my benefits before I receive my first check or after I receive my first check. I went to the website today because it said I couldn’t certify until “either Thursday or Friday” and it said I could not certify and to call the phone number listed. 

I completely understand that they are getting an extremely unprecedented amount of applications right now, so mine will be processed slower than usual. I guess I am reaching out here because I can’t find answers anywhere else. Has anyone already received their first check and can tell me an estimated timeline of their personal experience with being laid off due to this virus? I know the Illinois governor has enacted special rules regarding this virus so things are different, but is there anything else I need to be doing before I get my first check?

"So my restaurant,  like everyone else's, switched to takeout only a couple weeks ago. As a server I was worried I would be out of a job. My boss assured me I'd still have my job after all this.

So my boss tells me I could answer the phone/handle takeout orders for a few hours on Friday and Saturdays. He said I could still file for unemployment and these few hours would be a little extra money for me. I didn't really understand how that worked, filing for unemployment and then still working a few hours but I agreed to it.

I went in the last couple weekends and answered the phones. We did get pretty busy with orders.

I've been feeling sick and I have been doing some thinking... I don't think it's worth going into work for a few hours and coming into contact with people for a few extra bucks. My immune system is very weak, I tend to get sick often, so I'm at higher risk for catching the virus. And I sure don't want to spread anything to anyone in case I have it, not to my coworkers, customers, and especially my child. 

I call my boss today and tell him I don't feel comfortable coming to work anymore, even for a few hours. He instantly gets pretty bitchy with me, saying  ""you agreed to still do Fridays and Saturdays! Others have called out sick and if you call off we'll be in a bind! All you have to do is answer the phone and hand out orders!"" 

I was like ""I'm really sorry, I'm not trying to make things difficult for anyone but I'm worried about staying healthy. I don't feel good about going out for anything other than supplies at the grocery store"". He snaps at me ""fine, do what you feel you need to do, bye"" and hangs up on me.

"Hello I am a server who currents doesn’t know when the restaurant will open back up again (Like many of us). Currently I will be pushing at 3 weeks of no work. I love my job (even the bad days). My boss said when this is all over we all still have our jobs and can return. With bills and other things creeping up, I am starting to worry. Luckily my job offers emergency pay and I also applied for unemployment. So far I am good with money? But with both unemployment and emergency pay it is not nearly enough for my monthly bills. Thanks to my savings and doing taxes I am fine. My worry is down the road with no one knowing when we will open up again. My question is should I start working togo at my restaurant before this virus causes everything to shut down? I’ve asked people and they said it’s slow for togo which others say it gets busy sometimes. Other tell me they make more money with unemployment and emergency pay rather than working. And togo employee alternate shifts so I don’t even know how many hrs I’m guaranteed in a week. I know something is better than nothing right now. But should I go to work, get a new job, or do what others say stick with unemployment/emergency pay? 

More about my situation. I’m also in college and with this whole online transitioning they gave us more work with tight deadlines so I find most of my days working on school work (even though I’m bored and want out of the house). Im a full time student and always put 30+ hrs a week for work. I’m not the healthiest person but not the sickest either. I have really bad allergies (it’s allergy season so i look like I’ve always been crying) and get sick quiet often. I’ve had to get stronger meds for my asthma recently since my asthma keeps getting worse as time passes.

"Many years ago I worked at a restaurant where the customers placed their orders using a telephone. I worked in the fountain area, taking orders from both the restaurant and drive up over the phone, making the ice cream items, etc. 

Closing time was 10 PM. I shut the ice cream machine off at 9:30 so that I could start cleaning the machine at 10. I also turned the phones off at about 10 minutes to 10, so anyone who was in the restaurant but hadn't ordered would have to give their order to a server. Plus the cook stopped cooking at that time so they could clean. The owner was pretty strict about us being out by 10:30 PM.

One night, I had turned the phones off and was doing the nightly cleaning when one of the servers came up and said there were a couple of customers who wanted ice cream cones. I told her that the ice cream machine had been turned off for the night so I couldn't make anything with ice cream. By this time, the ice cream would be back to liquid so that it could be drained out of the machine. 

She came back and said that they wanted ice cream sundaes. Again, I can't make anything that has ice cream in it. She goes out, comes back and now they want milk shakes. By this time, the liquid has been drained from the machine and I am cleaning it. 

Front of house staff also had to be done by 10:30 PM. By this time the hostess realized that these two were still in the restaurant. She had already counted the money so she came over and told them to leave. They grumbled about not getting anything to eat, but they did leave.

I asked them if they were hungry, they said yeah, so I pulled out my book and pen, and just like I've done 1000's of times in the last 40 years, I looked at them and said, ""What would you like?""

 They were kind of taken aback and I said, ""Order whatever you want, and I'll get it for you."" They were like, just get us whatever you want to get us and I was like, no, that's not how it works with me, lol. You can get whatever you want. So what's your favorite thing here?

"I’m tired. To the bone exhausted. I’m in the process of slowly taking over my uncle’s bar/restaurant. We decided to stay open for takeout and try doing delivery. It’s was going pretty well, we cut down to 2 in the kitchen and 2 out front. We’ve been pretty popular in our Facebook advertising and our sales were great. Friday’s we aren’t even doing that much less in sales than a regular Friday, we do a big fish fry during lent that’s popular. However so far this week I’m not even sure if we cleared payroll yesterday or today, not to mention food cost and every other little thing. And now all the staff knows that if we shut down they could be home with no risk of being exposed to the public and be receiving the same amount they would get if we were open for normal business, which is more than they’re making now. A chunk of the staff does not qualify for unemployment with what they’re working right now. Morale is low, they’d rather be closed. The only reason they’re working right now is so they have a job to come back to. 

I worry about how much longer this is going to last. I worked my ass off at the beginning of this to be able to stay open as we are right now while my Uncle and the kitchen manager sat around and talked about how this whole thing is a democratic nightmare. I did it all alone and now I’m putting in 40+ hours a week, some of that off the clock so I don’t rack up overtime, why the hell am I doing this if I’m the only one willing to put up the work?

"Hey everyone! This is a little off-topic, but I cleared it with the mods. :)

Tl:dr: got laid off from your restaurant and looking for a job right now? Check out your local wine store! :)

I work in a wine/spirits shop in a big city on the east coast. This has been the busiest month we’ve ever had. Right now our focus is on deliveries—we just got the shelter in place directive yesterday from the governor and we’re limiting customers to 10 in the store at a time. Wine/beer/liquor stores are considered an “essential” business so we’re not stopping until this is all over. Yesterday we received more than 10 times our normal number of deliveries. I’m usually the only driver on Mondays and I’m lucky to get 17–we had almost 200 split between four drivers. I’m making more than 4 times what I usually do and before this I was making more money than I did as a curator.

**Reason why I’m posting** We’re so short staffed we’re hiring like crazy and our amazing GM is specifically focusing on people laid off from the service industry. This isn’t a post advertising a job, I just wanted to put out a PSA of sorts to let everyone know to check in with your local wine/beer/liquor store to see if they’re hiring if you’ve recently been laid off. I can’t guarantee that other stores are as busy as we are (we’re the busiest in the several stores under our owners), but maybe they are. Who knows?

Also, I heard from someone on here that distributors are also desperate for workers.  That could be a good option, as well.

I know it’s not awesome to be on the frontlines of things. I’m lucky because I’ve already had what my PCP says was covid 19 a couple of weeks ago—so I’m not as scared. She has a master’s in Public Health from Harvard, so I trust her implicitly. :) But if anyone ends up being a delivery person and wants a handmade mask (I’m finally using my BFA in textiles for something) hit me up. I can’t guarantee a ton of them, but we’ve got to look out for one another. They’re not pretty—I’m using fabric I already have on hand.

"Looking for advice from other servers on this forum... has anyone ever over-reported their tips on accident when clocking out and only find out when filing your taxes?

I do remember one single day during that time period where I didn’t realize I had already typed in my employee ID to clock out, and when I typed my ID# in again it accepted that number as my reported tip amount (i.e. thousands of dollars)and I immediately followed up with my manager and office admin who told me they would fix it...

But it looks like they didn’t and I can’t get ahold of the person in my payroll department via email or phone. I don’t know how else I’m supposed to fix it but I definitely did not make that kind of money at the restaurant I was at, ever. Any kind of advice would be appreciated.

Well today the pos screens weren’t working so I had to take orders by hand and ring them up inside (somthing the other carhops couldn’t fathom so I was the sole order taker) one of the first people I saw was my first customer when I moved out here and one of my favorite people who would come in, he’s not a super generous tipper but just the kindest soul so I was so excited to see him once all the orders came out I went back to talk to him and see how he was doing we both exchanged woes and I told him how everything went down and what I was worried about (y’all I was ThisClose to selling my nudes) and he tipped me $2 and I thought that was it and it was enough for me it truly made my day.
Well 2 o’clock comes around and all at once all 18 of our stalls filled up and we were shooketh thinking we were going to get hit bad, suddenly all of the boxes went off and every single stall asked for me to run their order at the beginning I was pretty excited because I hadn’t made more than $3 in tips and I was a little sad about it but this sort of made my day. Y’all this man called all the regulars from my job and told them where I was and what had happened and rallied everyone to come in, so all the orders were just cherry limeades and every single stall tipped my $100 dollars a piece.

"I am a waiter working at the 2nd best catalonian restaurant in Barcelona.

Once we had a table of 7 karens all abt 60-70yrs old. They were incredibly rude and demanding from the very start (we serve daily menu).Every time they wanted something they would go: ""hey, are you going to serve us boy?"" or something similar. The restaurant was completely full, and they were ordering drinks one by one, making me do alot of trips . It was ok, we are used to the occasional scumbag table.

Now, the restaurant is at the historic zone of barcelona and it is a dangerous zone and the hags demanded the table next to the door (the 2nd best table of the restaurant).They proceeded to leave their bags on the floor next to the door. you can guess it.Some random dude passing by saw it and apparently sneaked the hand inside and took a bag.Now, the bar, where I was at the moment, is right in front of the table and as I was drying some glasses. the most toxic of the pack comes to the bar screaming ""HEY BOY, ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING?"". Now I am a person that responds very negatively to these kinds of disrespects but I knew the table was composed of karens, so I was ready. Nonetheless, I looked in disbelief for a moment as i had no clue what was going on:

me: ""I'm sorry, what is the problem?""

K: ""Can't you see we were robbed?""

me: ""wha...""

K:""ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING¿?¿?¿?""

me: ""I'm sorry, what happened? Could you please explain?""

K:""SOMEONE STOLE A HANDBAG FROM OUR TABLE""

me: ""when? I am right in front of the door and I did not see anyone rob you""

K: ""WE WERE MUGGED! ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOUR JOB?""

me: ""I'm sorry, my job?""

K: ""AREN'T YOU GOING TO GET HIM?""

me: ""WHAT?""

K: ""DO YOUR JOB!""

me: ""Mam, I'm sorry, I feel for you. do you need me to call the police?""

K: ""WHAT?!?!?! CATCH THE THIEF!! DO YOUR JOB!!!""

me: ""listen lady. I am sorry you got mugged, I can do you the FAVOR and call the police.""

K:""THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, WE ARE EATING AT YOUR RESTAURANT IT'S YOUR RESPONSABILITY!!!""

me: ""ma'am I AM NOT. call the police please.""

k: ""HOW DARE YOU?! CALL THE OWNER IMMEDIATLY""

the owner comes and lets them know it is their fault they decided to leave the bags unattended and to stop screaming.If you think Karen was flipping you wait....after the owner goes back to his table to finish his meal karen informs me that the meal is complimentary since the stolen amount is equal to the bill they are going to pay (the bill was 7€ more than the supposed ammount stolen).

at this point my brain shuts down...

me: ""Listen here HAG, since you arrived you have been incredibly rude and demanding as if this was a 200$ per head restaurant. You can sit the flying fuck down, stop bothering the other 50 people dinning and call the police. IT IS NOT our fault you decided to leave your handbag near a glass door in the middle of the most dangerous neighborhood of the city""

K: ""THIS IS UNNACCEPTABLE, I WILL MAKE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT. IT IS YOUR Responsibility. I WILL TAKE THIS TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND LET EVERYONE KNOW WHAT YOU DID""

me: ""An official complaint? to what? the \[Im retarded as fk\] organization?""

her face was priceless, but you know karens, she was unabated.

k:""HOW DARE YOU!! IM GOING TO GET YOU FIRED IF YOU DONT MAKE THE MEAL COMPLIMENTARY. IM GOING ON FACEBOOK AND DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS""

me:""Mam, with all due respect, the only thing you can destroy is my braincells with your screatching, now sit the fuck down and finish your food orelse Im bringing the bill and calling the police.""

at this point the other 6 karens had gotten the message and tell her to sit and finish the food.But, as I said... I take these kinds of disrespects very poorly and my brain was already hyperventilating and unresponsive.I went to the owner and informed him of what I was doing so please print me the bill. (the owner knows me well)

me:""OK, you have been screaming for almost an hour, made sure everyone at the restaurant had a bad dinning experience.you guaranteed me I was getting fired for your lack gray matter and I'm done with your bullshit. Here is the bill, finish your seconds, you have no right to coffee or dessert (it comes included in the menu), I want to see you on social media as promised and when you do I will pay your bill out of pocket. you have 5 minutes to leave or I am personally going out to the main street and get an officer here.

"To preface this story, this was like 3 years ago so waaaaay before COVID-19 (I would probably understand a little more if it was now).

A few details before I begin: The café where I used to work was in a shopping centre. There were no bathrooms in the café, so if we needed to use the bathroom we went out and used the public shopping centre toilets (a couple of hundred metres away). Now I have slightly sensitive skin and I react to weird things (bandaids and adhesives, some soaps etc). It’s not bad enough to have to check ingredients or anything but there are some things I avoid that I know make my skin react. The dispenser soap in the public shopping centre toilet is one of those things. The other thing to know before I get onto the story is the café uniform is very distinctive (so people can easily tell where we work).

So, I’m on shift minding my own business and it’s quiet as it’s getting close to closing time. There’s only a few workers in the store at this time and I need to go to the bathroom so I power walk over to the bathroom, do my thing (number 1 if you want to know) and power walk back so I can keep cleaning/working and go home on time. When I’m in the bathroom I rinse my hands with just water because I react to the soap. The other thing about these public bathrooms is that the hand dryers barely work and there are no paper towels, so unless I want to stand there for about 5 minutes, I usually just wipe my hands on my apron and go back to the store. 

I’m in my own little world, minding my own business, I rinse my hands and go back to the store. I’m semi-aware of another lady in the bathroom who is looking at me so I half smile and then walk back to the store. She charges after me (I’m walking pretty fast) and follows me all the way back to the café, which I think is really weird but am kind of like… I haven’t done anything wrong so maybe she’s just decided she really wants a coffee?

We don’t have a bathroom in the café, but we do have a hand-washing only sink and a sanitiser dispenser and we have to wash our hands if we leave the café and when we come off break. I also often use the sanitiser throughout the day. So I get back and the lady comes in just after me and demands to see my manager (without telling me what the problem is first) so I point the manager out to her and then go out the back to wash my hands (with soap that I’m not allergic to) and come out the front about a minute later. 

Crazy Bathroom Lady is going OFF at my manager about how disgusting her employees are, I didn’t even wash my hands, it’s disgusting that we do that and then handle food etc etc. I come out, still rubbing hand sanitiser in.

CBL: See! She didn’t even dry her hands and they’re still wet

Me: Actually this is hand sanitiser

Manager: Our employees all have to wash their hands when they come back to the store and she clearly just did so there’s not much I can do

CBL: Give me the number for head office, this is ridiculous, even if you have to wash your hands when you come back it’s DISGUSTING to not wash your hands after going to the bathroom

(Which I did, just not with soap because I do that when I come back to the cafe)

Me: I did actually wash my hands, I just don’t use soap – 

CBL: Exactly which is DISGUSTING. Now go away I’m not talking to you I’m talking to your manager

My manager didn’t actually know I was allergic to the bathroom soap (because this has never come up before and the work soap is fine) and I couldn’t be bothered arguing with the lady about the reason I didn’t use soap, but manager is a legend and backed me up (also because she literally just saw me wash my hands when I came back). No idea what ended up happening, the lady stormed off in a huff,  I didn’t get in any trouble but after that I did tell several people in the bathroom that I was allergic to the soap if I noticed them looking at me (which was rare because most people mind their own business).The time a lady followed me from the bathroom back to work",TalesFromYourServer

"Hello I am the manager of a pizza restaurant that for now is just pick up and delivery. The company has taken some safety measures in response to COVID but these measures mostly serve to protect customers, not staff. I suggested 6 additional measures we should be taking to my manager. I also told him I wasn't comfortable working under the current conditions and that if nothing changed, I would want to be on leave. My store will go to shit without me. We are so busy it basically already has.

Three of my managers are international students and therefore are not Canadian citizens so they don't get free health care. They told me they didn't wan't to work over the weekend either. I absolutely do not blame them. Getting sick will cost them thousands and they can even die, half way around the world from their families. We are so busy and already so short staffed this puts me down to 9 employees when according to company standards, I should have 23. How am I supposed to function like this and I'm also worried for my health! I live with my parents who are 60+ and I am so in the line of fire I will eventually give Corona to them! This was my managers response to me telling him I want to be off:

Have you ever thought of all that \[company\] has done to make sure that it is remotely safe for their employees? Do you not believe that washing and sanitizing and ensuring all staff follow the procedures will keep them safe?

I’m not sure what you do on shift and how you communicate with your staff, but the way I have communicated with my employees in \[his store\] the only concern I have had was “I’m not comfortable dealing with the customers during this, do you mind if I just stay in the back and cook” and that was from a 15 year old kitchen employee.

My team feels safe, especially when they all come together and follow the guidelines and safety protocols set out by \[our owner company\] and \[brand company\]. A leader maintains a positive attitude and keeps their team cool, calm and collected.

They shouldn’t be led to panic. They should be provided with the facts and reassured the steps being taken by you the manager are safe guards for them. There are millions of people still working in the environment we are all working in. It’s a shame that you \[pizzagurl24\], being their leader, you’re backing off and leaving your team to fend for themselves, but you do what you think is right for you. You can’t tell me I don’t understand where you are coming from because I too am working on the front lines.

HILARIOUS UPDATE: two days after this encounter, the small town where his store is got a couple of cases of COVID and three of his staff said they wanted to be off. He's now int he same boat as me staff wise and he's stressed. I told him ""don't worry, just lead them to not panic and it will be ok."" Karma is a bitch. 

\+++++++ THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO READ TO GET THE JIST BUT MORE INFO BELOW++++++

Obviously, I was pissed. I sent him like 10 pictures showing how I have taken the steps put out by the company and showing how I have even come up with solutions on my own. I put a piece of plexiglass up at the till to separate us from customers and I sent that picture to him. A couple of days later, the people in this company who get to make decisions started coming up with their own version of this and enforcing it for everyone. My manager confirmed it was me that sparked this and yet he's telling me I'm not a leader?

I reminded him he hasn't seen these photos or heard much from me because EVERY DAY we get our ass kicked meanwhile the other stores are dead an the manager there has nothing to do but sit around and take photos and clean. And everyday the sales seem to increase exponentially like the corona virus itself. I will review and add more employees DAILY and then we still beat my new sales projections.

"Sorry so long, I'm a rambler.

TL;DR: how to learn from home how to become a fine dining server after ten years in casual corporate (""fanciest"" was the Crimson Crustacean... so yeah).

Since I'm stuck inside, I'm going crazy, and I'm sure many of you are, too. We're used to not only working in general, but having our shifts be long, interesting, varied, and requiring a lot of multitasking. We're, by and large, very smart. I can't play video games and read Reddit for weeks. I'm feeling stifled.

So what I've decided to do is create this thread to use as a resource to expand my repertoire as a server. I think once restaurants reopen I'm going to go back to where I was working (in the hopes that they use the shutdown to simply not recall the people who should have been fired by now), and keep working there while actively applying other places. 

At my age I'm ready to move out of corporate and into fine dining. I'm ok with WORKING at corporate ""fine dining"" to start, since people tend to eat with recognized brands, and branch out from there, but I need a jumping off point, and I need to build a skill set that sets me apart from other applicants. I'm in a great area for fine dining and I want to take full advantage (DC area, but far enough away for an excellent COL), especially since I'm getting a clean financial start this year and I'll finally be able to save money for myself.

One thing I've heard a lot about is wine and drink knowledge. I know becoming a bartender at my local place would be a joke on my resume to an actual establishment, not to mention not teaching me anything useful except for corporate recipes, so do any of you have good resources on where to start learning about pairings, blends, grape types, etc? Same with cocktails? I'm usually better at learning by doing, but I can't drink due to medication, so... I'm stuck with books and videos.

Also, I'm extremely personable, in a (how can I put this) ""Disney"" type way (former Cast Member). I'm very upbeat and outgoing at work. I don't think you have to be stuffy or snobby to be a fine dining server, but having never been to what I would consider a ""fancy"" restaurant, I don't know what is expected as far as demeanor. I already have the basics (never ""you guys"", always ""sir"" or ""ma'am""), etc, but don't know of anything beyond what I already do. I'm never on my phone at work, I never swear, even in the back. I'm just in ""work mode"", always professional, but I'm wondering if there's more that I should be doing if I want to move up.

Is there anything I need to learn about different types of service? Are there different types? Course service? Small plates? Closed parties like weddings? I've never served in any of these environments.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, along with anything else that you think would help!Super bored and ready to learn!",TalesFromYourServer

"Not a server, technically retail but my position requires personally-engaging-with-the-customer type service. No tips but I genuinely love the job.

For about a week leading up to my company's mass layoffs, they sent out health memos, each with increasing severity in terms of how we'd keep staff and customers safe. Mind you, in the weeks prior, they had already reduced labour hours and we were stretching our shift coverage thin. 

1st memo: ""it's all hunky-dory, just make sure to wash hands more consistently""

2nd memo: ""sanitize all highly touched areas AT LEAST 3x a day, no personal to-go cups, refilling personal containers""

3rd memo: ""absolutely NO DRINK SAMPLING"" which was insane because one of our non-negotiable focuses is to ensure every customer gets a sip of our teas, purchase or not.

Day before indefinite closure: verbally told tea sniffer samples were now off-limits. For my company, that takes away a largely known aspect of our business operation. 

In the 3 business hours I had to work solo, the store traffic was near relentless. I tried my darndest to juggle multiple customers at a time: explaining how teas tasted, filled go-bags, making drinks, keeping an eye out for possible theft AND sanitize at least 2 more times before close?? Customers clearly didn't care for physical distancing and my health as many paid with cash; I basically was washing or sanitizing my hands every 5 minutes. I closed the store early and even with lights off, door closed and locked, people were still pulling at the door, knocking to get my attention as I scrambled to complete all the end-of-day cleaning, counting the tills and the closing paperwork.

Before notice of the layoffs, management was deliberating shorter operating hours BUT 1 person would work an open-to-close shift: helping customers, acting as loss prevention, managing the sales floor whilst, again, keeping up with the new cleaning requirements.

Honestly, that was 2 weeks ago and I'm glad we ended up halting operations. I was stressed out of my mind, especially as our manager wasn't even taking the new cleaning precautions seriously: she had the gall to be miffed at my co-worker for keeping on top of the extra sanitizing (by herself!) between customers. Apparently, serving customers should always be put before any cleaning, regardless of the circumstances. Sure, I can wait until the store's dead to finally wipe down the pin pad that was sneezed on 5 customers ago!Customers first, Corona later.",TalesFromYourServer

I've talked to other employees who said their unemployment claims have all come back as zero.

"I just need to vent. 
Before I start first of all I am so blessed and thankful to still have my job but I am so fucking stressed out due to the current situation.
I am the general manager of a small restaurant/bar in a neighborhood in a middle-class area. My owner although I love her to death never really came in before this all went down or has even worked on the front lines in any restaurant. She did catering and party planning and after a few years of decided to open up a restaurant. The restaurant is very successful for her lack of actual “restaurant experience”. It just drives me crazy that she has absolutely no idea what it’s like to interact with customers and just work in a restaurant in general. I am the only employee working in the front of house right now so I’m working seven days a week long shifts I know it sounds like I’m complaining but I am very thankful to still have my job I just can’t deal with the stress. I’m afraid of being infected with COVID-19, she wants just me to take every order, cash out every customer run it out to the car if that’s what they want, bag everything up, prepare all the sauces. It’s a fucking lot. Also she asked me not to see my boyfriend since he is still working in a food manufacturing facility so he is around other people and might get sick. It wouldn’t be so bad if these people that wanted to get fucking curbside actually came when they said they were going to be there. Instead they’re 15 minutes late and bitching when I’m not outside waiting for them... seriously screw you stay home!. She screams at me saying I need to sell more when statistically I am the best server with the highest sales numbers and I know how to upsell like a boss. I mean I can only convince people of so much!!! I love my job, 90% of the customers are so awesome, it’s like family. I just need a break and a minute to freaking breathe.

"I’m a cook in Manhattan New York. When this situation happened my hours were cut by 10 hours. Fine I still can survive with the money I’ll be making but gotta cut back on spending tho and thankfully still have a job. I miss my old coworkers like litterally old people in the kitchen with me. It was fun working with them because they play along with younger people but due to this virus and their age they have to quit for their safety and they’re really scared. This morning I checked our group chat and read what the manager said. She said the last day is tomorrow and wemll be closed till April 11 and possibly be extended. It was sad and I was staring at the ceiling for like 10 minutes. I will miss the stress, the adrenalin rush when it’s super busy, training people how to cook and manage the kitchen. I know going outside is dangerous but I see us working in kitchen are little heroes because we make food for the hungry customers even tho there’s a lockdown in NYC.

"This isn't necessarily a tale from a server, tho I did my time in the past. This is just an emotional dump from a very tired and strained and hopefully good manager.

We're tired. We all had to make tough decisions, let people go that we worked with for years. Crying in our offices while people offer up their hours so their friends can stay and hopefully subsist on something. Hearing from above that the cuts we've made simply aren't enough, slowly paring down the skeleton we have to a mere spinal cord. 

Each day we open our email in dread of some new policy designed by someone who doesn't have to see the faces up close of the ones we work with and have developed bonds with. Every morning the drive is filled with the trepidation of not knowing what to expect.

I'm very thankful to have a job, to be sure, and believe me when I say I'm deeply sympathetic to everyone without. I've done everything I can think of to protect and feed, to manipulate systems and pay, and none of it feels enough right now. Coupled with the fact that management can often be a lonely endeavor, lacking in a good bit of the closeness you're allowed as a regular employee and in the middle of a bit of social distancing, we're fracturing inside.

We want everything normal again, same as you. We want our employees back, to have jobs, and despite some of the antics we deal with, we want something to do other than pick up 15 people's jobs while being cursed from above for the effort not being good enough.

Again, I don't know if this is the right place for this. I honestly don't have the time to thumb through rules of subs. I've been working non stop since this began, and I really just needed a chance to breathe and vent.

I promise you the good ones are trying, I just genuinely hope I belong to the group.

Thank you,
A grieving, strained manager


Edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold, I think it's my first ever, I have no idea what to do with it though.

Also, as sorrowful as it is to hear stories, it really is nice to personally hear that others are trying their hardest and we are appreciated. It's also been enlightening to hear things that I could do to help further.

Further edit: I just want to thank everyone for all of their kind words once again. This vent has helped me tremendously in working through my feelings and fears in this situation.

2 years ago, I worked at a hotel that was so isolated from the community, only old people went there. So this couple were international guests and had that ""our country is richer than yours"" and ""I'm better than you because you're a waiter"" attitude going on. Annoyed me to no end.

Our hotel had a special menu everyday from a different country. So we basically had 7 boards at the back with those menus. Tuesdays were Indian food.

One Tuesday evening, the couple comes in and they are sitted in my section. They order the special and I inform them that it will be a bit longer because I also had a table of 12 that ordered the exact same thing, not to mention other sections. They say it's fine, they will wait. Awesome!

Their food get to them and they eat everything. Of course I popped up and asked if their meal was fine, they say the food is perfect. I'm happy to hear that.

After the main meal, I clear up their table and ask them if they want the dessert menu. They say yes and i bring it to them. I can still remember what they ordered; an Amarula pilaif and White Chocolate Ganache.

They finish up and I ask them if they want any tea and petit fours. They say no and ask for the bill.  I leave them my pen because I assume they are just gonna charge it to their room. A minute later, I come back to ask if they need a card machine and all that. That's where it got amusing for some of us. The Mrs decides to take charge and tell me that they will not be paying for the mains because the pieces of meat in the soup were too big for a soup, only 4 pieces in the bowl and really spicy. What?

I ask what they mean and they repeat the very same thing. I tell them I can't do anything about it now because they already ate all the evidence and told me that everything was fine throughtout the whole dinner. They say that's not true and that they will not be paying. So naturally, I go and inform Duty Supervisor who is my hero because this woman doesn't take ish from anyone.

After 20 minutes of arguing, they take their things and leave. My hero take a card machine and follows them. I laugh and continue on because I still had tables and I also had to clear up theirs and reset it.

"Hello all, here's a story from a time long before the Coronavirus scare.

I worked briefly at a cafe. At this cafe there was a regular couple who would come in every other day, we'll call them the Ronsons.

Now the Ronsons were a husband and wife. Mrs. Ronson would come in with a different accent each day and would say that her medicine changes her taste-buds. They were one of those tables who took it as a challenge to see what kind of backwards-ass order they could send to the kitchen. Mrs. Ronson was known to completely deconstruct the concept of an arugula salad, and Mr. Ronson enjoyed ordering odd quantities of things - just for his dog for later.

We were very lucky that they tipped ok (if their demands were met) and they usually came in at a non-busy time so the kitchen had time to cater to their 'delicate' palate.

The most absurd thing I've ever witnessed in my short serving career was Mrs. Ronson's water order. Now, no ice? Got it. Lemon? Acceptable. A straw? All good. This goes wellllll beyond that.

Take a no-stem wine glass and hit it with the hot water on the espresso machine, dump out the water. Take an ice cube and swirl it around several times and pitch it. Add a finishing splash of soda water (but not too much), rinse it around, dry it out with a towel THEN fill it with regular water. She could apparently taste the difference if you did not follow her exact directions. She would need refills and would send the water back half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

On what planet is this acceptable? I remember the directions for Mrs. Ronson's water years after working at this cafe. I wanted to share to see if this is more common than I think.

I may run out of oil to heat my house but it warms my cold dead heart picturing you choking on your Nona’s Famous Lasagne. Get a good picture of it too. Now that’s a Yelp picture I’d like to see. And for the record, everyone thinks that their grandmother, or mother, or whomever, makes the best lasagne. I never order lasagne bc I’ve already had the best. If I did order lasagne at a restaurant, I wouldn’t complain if it wasn’t as good as the best I’ve already had. 

And how could I forget the influencers?!, with their lighting and cameras and, you guessed it...more entitlement! I can’t stand it anymore! Im almost out of ramen, but tonight I have a devious little grin wondering how all of those influencers are managing to eat without all the free food from fancy restaurants. I know they do it for their followers. Maybe I’ll follow one home and throw one of my cans of tuna at them (Wegmans had a 2 can limit). 

Oh, and my favorite! It’s a jam packed Saturday and you don’t have a reservation. Oh! You write for something prestigious? Condé Nast? Forbes? Right his way sir! Oh, this table isn’t good enough? I see...we are full but maybe I can...Oh! That’s not good enough. A manager? Ok...oh, their manager now. Oh dear. Yes, yes, yes absolutely. I understand. You’ve never been treated so poorly, and yes!, heavens yes!, someone’s head will roll. You’d better believe it. I may not have a roof over my head tomorrow, but tonight I’m happy picturing you at home with no one to stroke your ego or make you feel important. Because you’re not. Not in the way you think you are anyway.

"I saw a public freakout recently that reminded me of something that happened when I was a hostess in my early 20s at a steak house.

A family of 4 came in and when I sat them, the Mom (I'll call her Karen) wanted to move to an area where no tables were open. I told her she could wait back up front and we'd seat her when one of the tables opened. She insisted on standing right by the bus station so she had a view of the people sitting in her desired area. The four of them were in the way of guests and servers but Karen did not notice, she was too busy staring daggers at people eating. I went to the manager, who tried to move her but to no avail. Finally we just let them stay because we noticed a couple in a booth packaging up their food.

I checked in a few minutes later to see if that table had left yet and was dismayed to see they had ordered dessert and coffee. Karen was still standing there, watching them. The kids were bored and running up and down the wheelchair ramp. I asked Karen again to move back down to the waiting area as she was blocking servers and her kids were an accident waiting to happen. She loudly asked when her table would be ready and pointed right at the couple sipping their coffee. Knowing we were talking about them, the couple looked at us and smiled. It hit me then that they were not leaving on purpose. Fuck.

Karen realized it as well because she got very angry. She yelled that they were holding her booth hostage and we should kick them out. I told her we would not ask anyone to leave until they were ready. Then I watched in horror as the woman approached the couple.

Karen: You're done here, this is my table now. Pay the bill and go.

Couple (Smiling sweetly): We just got our coffee and dessert.

Karen: THEN TAKE IT TO GO!! WE ARE HUNGRY AND YOU'RE IN OUR BOOTH

Couple: This is our booth. It's not yours until we leave.

Karen raged insults at them until the manager came rushing up to help. He tried to intervene but could not be heard over her screaming about her starving children. The couple kept their cool the whole time, nibbling their dessert and stirring their coffee at a sloths speed.

Finally the manager had enough and told the woman to GTFO. She was utterly FLOORED that we were asking her to go and not the couple. She picked up an empty dessert plate from their table and chucked it across the room where it hit a wall and smashed into pieces. The manager screamed for someone to call 911 (This is before everyone had cell phones). I remember trying to hide my smile from the people around me. What adult acts like this? This woman was in her 40s! There were a ton of open booths too, just not in that area.

Karen's husband appeared, grabbed her by the sleeve and started pulling. She let him lead her towards the front door as she continued to yell insults at us. She called the manager a loser and mocked his career choice. She told me I was ""a plain nothing going nowhere"" and ""fucking worthless"" and when they'd gone, I went into the back for a while to hide. I needed to get away from people. When I returned, the server of the couple ran up to me.

Server: That couple left but they wanted to talk to you. They felt so bad about how that woman acted. They saw her watching them and she was being so rude, they decided to take their time to mess with her. They didn't think she'd do that! They waited a few minutes to talk to you but they thought you went home and asked me to give you this as an apology.

He handed me a $100 bill.

It was a shitty night but it kinda made me feel better. It's not every day a customer acknowledges when they've made your life miserable. Thankfully Karen was never seen again.

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to add: I said the couple made my life miserable because they were done eating and planning to leave but they decided to stay and fuck with Karen. If they'd just left, none of that would have happened. Nothing they did hurt me but the insults from Karen sure did. It's not easy to be a young kid making $5 an hour and being berated by people who think they're better than you. Woman in a restaurant demands a booth that is already taken. The couple sitting there find her rude and refuse to leave to ""teach her a lesson"". Chaos ensues.",TalesFromYourServer
"So I’m not actually a server, I am a hostess. However my job is a lot more complicated than you think. At my workplace, not only am I in charge of taking people to a seat, I have to manage multiple hour waits, bus tables, occasionally run food, clean, and so much more. And when we’re on those long weights, it’s especially frustrating when we get call aheads. 
If you don’t know what call  ahead is, it’s the shitty system that some restaurants put in place that lets you put in a reservation without it actually being a reservation? It doesn’t really guarantee anything but it essentially lets us know when you’re arriving. And we tell this to people all the time. Honestly I’ve been on the phone with customers arguing about this for multiple minutes on end, when I’m supposed to be busing or managing the front or literally anything else. The most frustrating part is when we get parties larger than 6 Who want to sit at a table at a certain time, right around dinner. Since it’s first come first serve technically, even though call aheads are added a little bit higher on the waiting list, it really doesn’t benefit you other than hey we know you’re coming so we can kind of plan. But when dinner comes around, there’s really not much we can do.

The day of this event is your typical normal Saturday, nothing super special, but we get mad dinner rush is because we are a steak place. I can’t say which one, but it’s a really popular one for good steak. Honestly I love my job, until I get a call saying I have 18 people that I need to be set at 6:30 PM and we need to table as soon as we get there.

Obviously this is not going to happen, we have a ton of booths that seat four people, and most of them are for around this time, we have high top tables that seat up to six, eight if you squeeze, and a few other tables that can be pushed together if necessary. There’s not a lot of wiggle room here.

So as soon as I get that car I’m thinking oh hell how the fuck am I gonna sit eighteen people in this tiny little space. I can’t deny customers seats when they’re already here, so I Kinda have to wait till the party gets there to see them or even really find a place.

No being the leader who kind of runs the show, I usually am able to plan ahead and find a section that will work, and since we work with electronica computers, they have timer saying how long people of been there. This allows me to know what tables are going to be available for what servers, so I can plan this kind of thing. But 8 people takes up alot the tables in one side of a restaurant. And then nobody wants to sit by them.

Will 630 rolls around, and a big group of people start to arrive. And diving through the front of the crowd… You guessed it, Karen.  

“Hi this is Karen,  we had a reservation for 630 for 8.”

“Yes I see that I’ve got you on my list. I will add you to the waiting list now, it’ll put you in a little higher up because you called ahead, but know that I will have to see it smaller parties ahead of you, and I’m waiting on some tables to clear. It could be anywhere from 20 minutes to 40 minutes, depending on how long those tables decide to stay.” 

No this isn’t Word for Word, but you get the gist. She demanded to know why I wouldn’t see her party immediately that “ she had a reservation” even though as I explained every customer the calls, we don’t take reservations, it just helps us plan ahead and possibly shorten your wait time when you do get here. I just check people in, and the computer does that for me. 

Karen, grunting, returns to her family and discusses the situation. At this point, dinner rush is in full swing. I’ve got five people on my team, two of which are pretty much useless, mostly because one is high on crack most of the time, and the other is new. So I’ve got my partner seating people, and helping me manage the front. There are tons and tons of people coming in and the lobby is stuffed to the brim.   

After I pry my busy eyes away from my last customer I hear a commotion coming from the back of the restaurant.

Karin had decided to scope out tables for herself. 
“ look at all these clean empty booths!” They hadn’t been wiped “ look at this table! It’s open!” 

“Yes ma’am the table is open but it only seats six people. Normally I would be able to pull the Table next to it and create one large group seat, but unfortunately we have other customers there already.” 

And now the words we’ve been waiting to hear…

“ get me your manager!” 

At this point she was practically screaming. The whole restaurant was staring at her making faces and being clearly uncomfortable. So I apologize to the people in the front and I asked one of the busers to come up and watch the front for a moment while I go and get the manager.   

The funny thing is, I had to call up the busser or who is putting the tables together and busing the table that we were going to use for her. The previous part he had left pretty quickly. But now I didn’t have a Buser because I needed someone to watch the front.

So this lady gives a big stink to my manager, and demands to know why she wasn’t able to sit in her reserved seat. 


M my manager having my back, also noticed that We were setting up her table, Took her over there and showed her the table. It still wasn’t good enough. She demanded free food, she wanted appetizers for the whole party and she wanted them comped. 

My manager, being a really nice guy, and not wanting to lose business, agreed. This lady looked at me with this childish grin on her face. She looked like she had one son Victoria’s bottle, when she would’ve been seated a lot faster if she had just waited the two minutes it would take the bus the table, instead of taking an extra 10 for the ordeal of going to get the manager.


Honestly, I think the lady just wanted free food.
And… The party did not tip. The bill was over $200. Since I work on temperature, I got kind of low balled that night when I took all my tips.

Fuck you lady, some of us are just trying to make an honest living. We have to pay out of our pockets to serve you, who is being a jerk to us the entire time. I was almost disappointed that they had such a nice waitress, because I would’ve love to see her spit in her food.

"This was three years ago. I was working the front counter of my local fast food pizza chain conglomerate. When this guy walked in. High as a kite. He was an African American man with a Snoop Dog cocky grin. He had a beer gut, and a stained white wife-beater tank top to match. But the most definitive feature, I must say, was the large boa constrictor wrapped around his shoulders. 

He walks up to the counter. 
“Y’all serve food here?”
“Yes sir, we do.”
“Oh! That’s good. Cause I am huuuuuuungry.”

He orders his food, and I give him his total. That’s when he goes
“Ooooo. I’m actually a little liquid right now. But I’ll tell you what. If you cut me a deal,”
He says, taking something out of his pocket, and softly putting it on the counter, revealed to be a bong,
“I’ll give you a hit, what do you say?”

Now, I don’t do drugs. Much less unknown drugs from weird people I just met. This dude was strange. I would be so lucky if it was only snake urine in there. While trying to figure out the “corporate friendly” way to refuse, I guess I took too long. Because my manager, R, comes bolting up to the front, quick as a vampire.
“Don’t you dare, u/!”
“I wasn’t going to, sir! I like working here!”

R then tells this guy to either pay for his food or leave. Snake man gets offended.

“Why? Because I’m black?”
“No! That snake around your shoulders! It’s a health code violation!”
“What, ol’ Jerry? He’s my emotional support snake!”
“Either pay for your things, or leave.”
“I’ll have to go aaaaall the way back to my pad to look for some loose change, I guess!”

As he was walking out the door, he turns to his snake and said “Jerry, you ruin everything!”

Never saw him again. But the story doesn’t end there. Because the guy had forgotten his bong on the counter. No big deal right? Throw it away. But R freaked out.

“Are you kidding? We can’t throw that away here! If corporate finds that in our trash, we’ll all be liable to drug tests or possibly we could all be fired without testing!”

That sounded so fake to me. First off, why would corporate be going through our trash? Secondly, firing an entire staff team without reason is illegal. But... ugh. This idiot comes to save the day. This idiot, from the day he somehow got hired, despite frequently coming in smelling of pot, came up to were we were all by this time gathered at the front around R.

“I’ll uh, take it to my car! Corporate can’t know if I throw it away at home!”

R, that offer going right over his head, praised the imbecile for his quick thinking. I’m pretty sure idiot took twenty minutes on the clock to “take it to his car.”

That idiot would go on to get promoted over me, despite him being hired months as opposed to my nearly three years. It would ultimately be one of the reasons I left. I do hope R is doing ok.The Snake Man Story",TalesFromYourServer

Our Arcade bar in Evansville, Indiana is shut down right now while we try to manage the response to COVID-19.  As a result, our staff is without work.  We are paying them as long as we can, but we are a small business and can't keep it up forever.  Additionally, a staggering amount of food service employees around the country are facing the same troubles.

We are starting a twitch channel where our staff(at least to start) is going to stream classic arcade, console, and pinball games to raise money for these people.  Every dollar donated will go to help keep food on the table and lights on for a food service worker in need.

Most of Reddit doesn't know our staff, but I promise it will be a good time if we don't even raise a dollar.  Just to name a few, we have a top 10 Galaga player in the world going for more works records and a top female Donkey Kong player going for kill screen.  The rest will be filled with pinball, SNES, and classic PC games like Ultima and RuneScape.

Since the California lockdown, all restaurant have been forced to do take out only. I work at an all you can eat sushi place and weve decided to do all you can eat togo. 

This customer in particular was very nice (at first). She said she supports local businesses and shes glad i still have a job (etc, etc.). We had a lot of togos because of the ayce deal that the wait time is up to an hour long! So this woman and her husband sat inside (disregarding our sign to wait outside of the restaurant for our safety) and drink their beer. She was waiting about 45-60 minutes and talks to other customers while telling them she doesnt believe in the corona virus. That she believes the president is causing mass hysteria and that she thinks the social distancing wont do anything beneficial. She went on to say her son has been traveling through asia like Japan, Taiwan, and China and reveals that her friend was confirmed to have corona virus. She added that she was with her last week and hasnt gotten any symptoms so the virus isnt real. She went on and on about how ridiculous it was while i quickly packed her togo to get her to leave. 


After she left I was livid. I have two babies i go home to (which are my sisters kids) and my dad comes over to my house often. Hes old and has a weak immune system due to chemo. It baffles me that this woman had no disregard for anyone but herself. I called the San Bernardino health department and they transferred me to customer care at CDC.

"Ok so this sounds wild but I work in a restaurant in a very popular beach road in Florida. We are a wine bar with an exquisite charcuterie board menu as well as lunch and dinner options. We are in a really small and quaint but very upscale community and we have a wine happy hour 11-6 daily so we get a lot of people that just want to sit on the patio and drink wine and eat cheeseS There are very little parking lots because most people ride their bikes, drive golf carts, or walk. We are right across the street from the beach so when weather is nice, our patio is where people like to be. People will literally walk up to another table who is about to close out and sit with them to reserve their seat. We don’t always have daytime hostesses so the “take a name” game gets a little messy. But holy shit I have never in my life seen so many people sit at dirty tables, much less dirty tables that still have people sitting at them. We’ll literally get triple sat and all 3 tables will still have water and wine glasses and cheeseboards all over it. So it’s like ok let me just buss all 3 tables and wipe them off and then 30 minutes later I’m getting your wine order. Could you not have waited 30 minutes for us to seat you? Almost everyone who does this has already been addressed and told that we will let them know when their table is ready. But these people just seem so entitled.

The stakes for me personally are low, and some time has passed— it’s not like they can retaliate nor do I fear for my own safety. My complaint is truthful and I’m hoping, especially during these times in which it’s more important than ever to have sanitary standards, someone catches on to this place.

It's scary and everyone is vulnerable, it really amazes me that there are still people who come in with their antics and add on to the stress. It really speaks volumes.

I wanted to share a story of my most petty moment I had as a server, for the hope that I can at least give someone validation in this tough time.

I served for 12 years after this incident. That being said, this happened when I had only served for a few months, so I was a server baby. Still...I don't feel bad about it.

I worked at a chain restaurant (logo was a pepper) in a very nice California city. During the closing lunch shift, one guy got sat in my section, waiting for someone to join him. Totally nice, polite. No problem. Other guy finally shows up....  Story changes:

Douche: "" I'm assuming you don't have bottled water.""

Me: ""We have * brand bottled water *, we also have * brand seltzer water *""

Douche: ...did I say anything about carbonated water?

Me: ...?

Douche: I don't drink tap water. I don't drink anything with chemicals.

Me: ok...so would you li-

Douche: (swishes his paperwork in my face) I think you can figure it out.

So I get the bottled water, pour it partially into his cup at the table with ice.

Douche: I know you might not know this but...where does this ice come from?

Me: ...our ice machine...

Douche: So, that comes from the tap. In case you don't recall, I don't drink tap water. What is ice made out of?

(I didn't even answer at this point because I was seeing red)

Douche: Taaaap waaaater... Try again sweetie.

I took the bottle of mineral water and his cup. I literally dumped everything out in the back. Didn't even fill the water up at the soda machine. Went into the bathroom sink, filled the cup mostly full and a bit into the same bottle I brought to the table. Waited a couple minutes, then brought it out to him.

Nope. It wasn't. At all. Happy you paid for chain restaurant sink water at a premium? Ya douche.

He demanded to know why I hadn’t asked him if he’d like sugar and when I went to explain he cut me off saying that I am the worst server he’s ever encountered, that it is my job to ask and how dare I assume he knew there were no sugars on the table (literally none visible?) and said that we should have just shut and not bothered to open that day. I told him that after 12pm we were and this “man” told me that he was glad I was losing my job. I have never in my life come across someone so blatantly nasty and I just walked away. My manager held me while I cried and then when she went to take his meal over he sat there smirking and saying how his jobs safe and how much money he was earning and how important he was. He was laughing at people who were crying and suffering. No happy ending, the man marched out of there in the end smirking and bragging to anyone who would listen.

"We went to takeout only. Thats fine. I still made basically what i needed to but boss changed the entire schedule without calling anyone.  My coworker stopped by my house to make sure i knew i worked tomorrow and told me that she took pictures of the schedule and have been texting it to everyone because our boss said ""yall need to check the schedule in person and come in anyway even if you dont work"" and my coworker told him that wasnt fair. Most of us walk or bum rides to work or dont have the gas to be coming to work if they dont NEED to. Like yeah, okay, mr manager, you dont get it because YOUR GAS IS PAID FOR BY THE COMPANY but some of us have to squeeze our gas for an indefinite amount of time.  Fuck off with the nonsense.

But since we went takeout only, i went from 35 plus hours last week to 14 hours next week.  Two shifts.  And ill make it work.  I have to.  But unemployment is being crazy. The website doesnt work every time i launch it and they also want the last 18 months worth of pay stubs.  Ive switched jobs a couple times. I dont have access to most of that information at the moment. Im trying. But its hard.

This is probably the worst thing I've ever eaten. 

Neither you nor your terrible children hardly even acknowledged my empty glass while you were cooking. In fact, they were just watching Disney + the whole time.

When I knocked on your door, I had to wait AT LEAST 1 minute before even a single soul came to answer.

By the way, your soap is almost out in the bathroom. Just thought I'd let you know since it seems like y'all are so busy.

You need to hire more staff. This place is turning into a disaster.

"Hi TFYS, this is your friendly neighborhood restaurant manager here. Sorry if this story is kind of all over the place, I just got home and had to vent.

I work in a pizza restaurant in Illinois, and if you are paying attention to the news, you know that Illinois is under a ""Shelter-In-Place"" order. Basically, people can't leave their homes except to utilize or work in ""essential services"". Restaurants count as an essential service, however we can only do pick up and delivery.

So since we are only doing delivery and pick up orders, we are closing a bit earlier due to business dropping off early. Tonight we were going to close at 9:00, while we usually close at 11:00. 

We had one last pick up order that was placed at 8:15. The person who took the order told the customer it would be 45 minutes. Unbeknownst to me, the other closing manager had decided that he wanted all of the orders picked up by 8:45 so he could get out early. So he called the pick up order to tell them to get there by 8:45 to pick up their food. The customer didn't answer the phone, and the manager didn't leave a voicemail.

Because the customer didn't arrive by 8:45 (because he was told his order would be ready at 9:00), the other manager cancelled his order in the POS and closed out the drawer. I was in the back working with the drivers, so I wasn't aware any of this was happening.

The customer came to get his order at 9:00, and the other manager told him the order was cancelled. I was so mad, we are in the middle of a pandemic and the manager cancelled this guy's order for no reason other than he wanted to leave a few minutes early. 

The customer came to get his order at 9:00, and the other manager told the customer, ""Oh, we tried to call you, since you weren't here at 8:45, we cancelled the order."" The customer was understandably upset, but still was as nice as he could be given that he was just told he couldn't have his dinner. 

I looked in the hot box, and the food was there, there was no reason to cancel this guy's order. The other manager was actually arguing with the customer, saying it was the customer's fault because he didn't answer the phone. This is when I got upset, because the customer did nothing wrong besides not answering his phone for an unknown caller. 

At this point, I did kind of overrule the other manager. I didn't want the customer to miss out on his food like that, especially since there was a good chance nothing else was going to be open at that time. I told the other manager that we have the food, we can just give it to the customer. The other manager was adamant about not giving the customer the food, saying, ""But how are we going to charge him? The drawer's closed.""

You guys. I was ready to just give the customer the food for free because of the ridiculous hassle, but the customer said he had cash and didn't need change, so I just gave him the food and grabbed the cash. At this point, the other manager got upset and walked away, he ended up just leaving for the night even though he was supposed to finish closing procedures with me. It was absolutely no problem at all to close the customer's check, all I had to do was pull it up and use the driver computer to close it out. Literally no issue with it whatsoever.

I'm sorry for the rambling story, but I was just so upset with the other manager tonight. I cannot believe that he did something like that, especially now when there is such a crisis going on. I know the other manager is pretty young and probably doesn't have great experience with handling different customer service situations, but this was just ridiculous. We are a small business, and we cannot afford to treat customers like this. I literally had a meeting with the owner this afternoon about how we need to focus on customer service with our team, and all I could think of was how it would look to the owner if this guy left a poor review the same day we had that discussion. 

Am I the crazy one here? Idk, what does everybody think about this?Am I wrong for being upset about this?",TalesFromYourServer
"Last week I lost my job due to the pandemic. A few days prior to this, an older lady came in and ordered a double shot of patron. She was incredibly kind and was worried about restaurant workers’ livelihoods during these hard times. 

She paid her $12 tab with a $100 dollar bill and told me to split it between the host, another server and myself! We were so grateful for her generosity and she told us that she loved us and that she had plenty of money. She said that she felt a calling to share her wealth with those who need it most. 

She came back two more times throughout the shift, ordering small desserts and a cocktail and, again, paying her tab with $100 bills and telling us to split it evenly between us. She said that she kept coming back because she could tell that we were hurting, and that she knew she had to help.

I ended up taking home about $90 in tips from this sweet lady. My coworkers and I expressed our gratitude and asked if she was sure she wanted to give us this much money, to which she replied that she was certain. 

A few days later I lost my job, as our mall closed for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic.

Thank you so much Mrs. Liz. I’ll always remember your kindness. I’ll follow your example and help those in need, because we all need each other right now. When all this is over and if I see you again, I’m giving you the biggest hug and a thank you card. Much love.

"I'm one of the few fortunate servers to still have a job at the moment. Our restaurant turned into a To-Go only restaurant. We've been pretty busy lately and our employers are making sure we have shifts and food to take home to our families.

They had us sign a piece of paper to carry around with us that states that we are ""essential employees"" since they're shutting down non-essential workplaces. There was a confirmed COVID-19 case in the hospital across the highway and they're under a two-week shutdown quarantine. I found out about thirty minutes ago the county I live in just got placed under quarantine.

The job I worked at for three years as a server trainer had their last day on Monday before being shut down until further notice so a lot of my friends are out of jobs.

These are scary times right now. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Luckily the people who are out buying food from us are being generous and understanding.

"Had two nurses come in tonight to pick up takeout. It was obviously a large order for a group, so I offered them shakes on the house. They asked for four - which was only $28. So, I took HALF off their to go order (another $48), saying “We really appreciate all you’re doing, this is just a small token.” Did they say thank you? No. Just picked up their order and left. Tipped $1 on their credit card slip and THEN came back in. “I didn’t like the birthday cake shake, can I get something else?”  I just looked at the other girl working with me. Fortunately she said “We don’t do remakes in COMPLETELY COMPED items.”No good deed....",TalesFromYourServer
"I work a at a local pizza place, and yesterday we had a $442 order of seventeen large pizzas that was to be picked up at 5:30. We’re only doing curbside service right now since no one except employees are supposed to be in the building, so this guy called at 5:20 to let us know he was here. I ran his check out to him and let him know his order was starting to come up, and we would run it out to him when it was ready. He seemed fine with that and signed his receipt.

Y’all this man left me NOTHING. I think I actually stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the “0.00” on the tip line. Our kitchen is TINY and this order took up the entire oven and window for at least 30-40 minutes. It caused us to be on a delay that took us the rest of the shift to catch up from. Not to mention we’re running on a skeleton crew and all of our hours have been cut. It also took the wind out of my sails for a bit because it was one my first orders of the day. 

My manager told me she would back me up if I said something to him, but in the end another coworker ran the first three pizzas out to his car and told him he could pick the rest up himself at the door. 

And as a bonus, the woman who placed the order later called back to complain that we had forgotten two of their pizzas. My manager asked her which were missing and she said she didn’t know and that she’d have to call back. We knew without a doubt that wasn’t true; we were super careful with our labeling and didn’t have two extra pizzas sitting around that we’d forgotten to hand him. The woman called back and my manager had her list every pizza she received. All I heard her say was, “Ma’am you just named off seventeen pizzas...” It turned out that whoever took the order had written “15 pizzas,” and when I rang in their to go fee (only $.35 per item, it pays for the to go containers) I hadn’t double checked and just typed in 15 instead of 17. So instead of counting to see if they had the right amount of pizzas in front of them, they saw their receipt had the wrong number on it and called back. And I had even saved them $.70 (lol)! 

But like I said, pretty much everyone else I interacted with was understanding and tipped above and beyond what I expected so I can’t complain too much! Just a sour note to start the night on.In general, everyone’s been amazing and tipped very well. This story is not about them.",TalesFromYourServer

We just worried about the dedicated team and loyal people who make the hotels ""go"" and get everything done. We were able to figure out some weird legal stuff to keep employees covered with health insurance, and furlough them so they could both be rehired but not fired but still unemployment, but we're all reinventing the wheel, right now, and making up systems that never existed, trying to resolve issues that no one knows answers too.

I am so sorry we can't do more.

"I recently got a job at the local US supermarket just before the outbreak erupted, so my first day was met with hoarders and panic shoppers emptying out the store. It was a crapshow 

The store adapted really well to the situation, and as the weeks progress, we are becoming the overlords of my state. Non-essential businesses closed down, which means we are now the best clothes store, electronics outlet, and restaurant in my county. Our stockpile of “essentials” like toilet paper and cleaning supplies hasn’t been cleaned out due to our rationing system (1 per customer). So I am there firsthand denying hoarders their contraband and watching them get flustered with the rationed amount they can have. I am now the Warden of Toilet Paper.

We’ve also gotten some perks from HR as well. Our governor just gave some orders out about what stores should be open and whatnot. Apparently, I am now “Essential Personnel,” and I get to go past the Curfew that has been put in place with my state. I also got a raise until May. You win some, you lose some. I am now paid extra to be in the most susceptible place to get sick. Whoohoo. 

I know most of you are rational human beings, but here’s just a PSA from your local cashier: Don’t panic buy. Trucks are still coming in and supplying the store. However, do buy all the groceries you can in 1 trip: avoid seeing too many people to avoid being sick. Finally, if you have been laid off or your funds have been halted due to this crisis, consider joining your local supermarket.

"Math was never my strong suite even after uni, but i never stopped learning. This is why I chose to become a cashier even when i didnt know how to deduct or add money. 

I felt very embarassed at the start but some customers were very supportive when I whipped out the calculator on more 'complex' sums. I know some gave the look, but they know that at least they will get the correct change back.

 Eventually 6 months in i got very adept at numbers and some days go by without the calculator.

It just so happened that i was very absent minded after 2 days off and the coffee hasnt kicked in yet. So naturally i punched in the numbers just to be sure and the aunty was like 'its 19!' and she started laughing after I i pressed it in wrongly and restarted punching. 

It was a 'omg youre retarded' expression and i said 'miss i havent done cashiering in a while'. She went back to her table and i saw her talking to her husband about it, giving me some glances while she was at it.

I was rather taken back as sometimes i would use the calculator just to make sure, and customers would looked more reassured.  Would u rather have me give u the wrong change?? Since youre so smart would you like to do my job?? I was a little annoyed for a while but i learnt not to give a fuck about these sort of people. Why is this even an issue?

So today, every bar, pub and restaurant in the UK was ordered shut as soon as is reasonably possible. We’ve been hoping for this as it means the government can provide us with support during these tough times. 

I work at a relatively isolated forest holiday park, which has accommodation and camping facilities. The plan was to close the bar at a reasonable time in order for those who may have arrived that day to be able to eat and share a drink or two for the last time in a while with friends and family. 

At 9.45 I decided to call last orders, as we had about 20 odd people in and as our orders were to close as soon as deemed necessary, I thought it would be a good call. I had two different parties come to the bar and complain that the bar was shutting early, saying they had been told that we were staying open until 12am. I told them that as the circumstances were changing rapidly, we were shutting at our discretion, for the safety of ourselves and other customers. 

Nope, that wasn’t good enough. Why weren’t we staying open later? What good is it when the park bar shuts early? I explained that we were open to mainly provide food for those who hadn’t eaten that evening, and that drinking alcohol wasn’t necessary as eating and getting essential supplies (we have an onsite shop). 

These people were angry and pissed off that I was shutting the bar and demanded at least a partial refund to their stay. I’m more than happy to provide them with a partial refund but really?

Several people were already considering leaving before COVID-19. Other staff may simply be forced to find other jobs in unaffected industries &amp; just decide not to come back.  

I have a feeling at least a few of our hourlies won't return &amp; I wouldn't be surprised if the newest manager bails either. That makes me sad, he was the only good one we had.

"Logged into HotSchedules and saw that our restaurant’s corporate head decided to shut down our location permanently. This is the most wild ride and I’d like to get off asap. No phone call. Not even an email. Just an announcement on the site saying that it was a pleasure working with our team and that they wish us luck. If anyone in FL knows of any resources for aid or assistance, please pass it forward. 

My heart is with anyone else being fired, laid off, or had their restaurant shut down. It feels like we’re headed for dark times. Understandable given that this is a pandemic but fucking hell.

"So, I think we all thought for those that are still somewhat fortunately open that people would have compassion, right? That to go orders will actually tip. If dine in is still open, your server gets maybe 7 on 20. WRONG, I TELL YOU! 

So currently I am quarantined until my brother’s coronavirus results come back. I’m not going to my shifts these next few days. But let me tell you my last experience at work before my quarantine. Infected. Karen. 

So it’s actually kind of busy. No one gives a shit about self distancing when you want food. Your welcome for providing the food, you’d think. But not a lot of people are appreciative and in fact... ignorant. And I have received more proof of that when “Karen Knoll” (not her real name, but I know it to memory from the amount of times this crazy lady called me yesterday) calls up my store. 

Me: “Thank you for calling _____! This is Ladle speaking. How can I help you? :)” 

Karen: “Are y’all still open during this whole uhhhhh “virus”?” 

Me: “Yes we are! We are also offering curbside pickup if you don’t feel comfortable coming in!” 

Karen: “Okay.... do y’all have a chef’s salad?” 

Me: “No, we do not, but our garden salad comes with [insert list].”

Karen: “THAT’S NOT A CHEF’S SALAD! Do you know where I can go to get one?” 

Now... why the hell would I even know where to get one? Secondly why would I help you when you clearly aren’t going to eat here?

Me: “Uhhhh. No ma’am. I don’t know where to get one.” 

She hangs up abruptly. 

Twenty minutes later, Karen Knoll pops up on the phone, again. I thought her attitude was already bad the first time... it wasn’t. 

Me: *repeats intro*

Karen: “Yeah... I called here twenty minutes ago to get a chef’s salad. But no one else has it. So TELL ME what’s on your salad!” 

Me: *considering licking a doorknob* “It comes with..... and your choice of dressing.” 

Karen: “I already knew what’s on the salad. Shut up. But where’s the HAM?! I want my HAM!!!” She’s really disgruntled over some ham at this point. 

Me: “... we have the ____ salad which comes with ham and bacon. Would you like that?” 

Karen: “GIVE ME TWO ORDERS... and a lasagna. :)” 

I ring her up for two of our specialty salads and the lasagna. 

Me: “So the lasagna comes with a side salad or garlic knots. Which would you like?” 

Karen: “The side salad.”

Me: “Alright ma’am so I have one lasagna with a side salad and two specialty salads?” 

Karen: “I DON’T WANT THE SIDE SALAD! I DON’T WANT ANYTHING BUT MY SALADS AND MY LASAGNA!” 

Me: I lost patience at this point. “So you want ONE LASAGNA with NO GARLIC KNOTS, NO SIDE SALAD, you want NOTHING WITH IT, but you want the TWO SPECIALTY SALADS?!” 

Karen: “Yes. And you better MAKE SURE it’s curbside at 6:30PM!” 

Me: “Alright we will have it ready at *speeding up because I can hear her hanging up* 6:30 curbside and your total is $33.70.” The dial clicks at seventy. 

Five minutes later, Karen Knoll is back on caller ID. I make my friend take it since everyone in the restaurant heard me getting pissed with this disrespectful lady. She starts screaming at my coworker that she’s also incompetent and how she’ll report me to corporate. (It’s a small business, boomer.) Her credit card ended up not working with my coworker and then I heard her screaming slurs towards my friend. My manager came on the phone as she was on a rampage. She was screaming about her credit card, blaming us, trying to report us while my manager is rolling his eyes and my friend and I are saying a bunch of crass insults under our breath. Finally the card goes through. 

We force our friend who hasn’t faced Karen Knoll’s to do her curbside order 45 minutes after she was supposed to be here. Of course what comes up is a car oddly with its emergency lights on, a janky car barely kept together, and a crazy and wiry looking crackhead lady blowing cigarette smoke onto her seats. No window open. She fortunately was kind to my friend and tipped her. That’s all we asked for. Just remember at this point that she confirmed, paid for, and saw one lasagna and two salads. 

An hour later, we get another phone call. Karen. Knoll. I answer it to make sure she hears my customer service voice in some hope that she sees she’s the one being a poor sport. She demanded a manager. 

Karen: “M-MUH SALADS AND O-ONLY ONE LASAGNA! I ASKED FOR TWO! I WANT FREE LASAGNA!” 

Even though we all heard me yell her order confirmation, my coworker confirm it during payment, my other coworker show her the food and what not, my manager caved and allowed her to get a free lasagna. With the crackhead energy and the crackhead aesthetic, I’m not surprised she was probably tweaking out.Infected Karen",TalesFromYourServer

"Tldr at bottom


I got called in tonight (had already worked from 8am-3pm) because as the title says we will be closed tomorrow for a minimum of 15 days and the whole FOH staff for the night called off and all but 2 cooks and 1 dishwasher called off as well.


I show up and our patio and bar is full. There's a manager bartending and 2 managers hosting/serving. Food is taking a while because the kitchen is also under staffed. 


For the most part every one was understanding and nice and simply glad that we were open.  Except that is for one table we'll call them Karl and Karen. I clock in at 6 after rushing back to work and I am running around trying to make sense of things (1 other server also got called in, a new hire who technically isn't even supposed to be taking tables) I am literally running between tables and the kitchen trying to make everyone as a steady stream of people keep flowing in. 


Now my manager had started Karen and Karl's table and had already taken their order. Whein I showed up he went back to expo and I took over almost the whole patio all tables he had started so I have no idea who is at what point of their service and I have to figure it out for my self and fast. During all this madness Karen waves me over exclaiming how she has been waiting for forever for more water (her glass is 1/3 full and her husband has a full glass) so I apologise and fill her water. I then bring them their food. 1 shrimp pasta with extra shrimp on the side. Karen was only have the side of shrimp as her 'meal'. I make sure everything is ok apologise for the wait and fill Karen's water. A few minutes go by and I check on them and top off the Karen's water, Karl still hasn't touched his water. A few minutes goes by and I am being frantically waved down again because Karen needs more water (Her glass is half full this time). I ask for the third time if everything is ok as I notice she hasn't touched her side of shrimp. Karen tells me she asked ""The Boy"" for some sauce for the shrimp and has been waiting for it forever. (Mind you I was just at the table 5 minutes ago) I ask her what kind of sauce she needed and she replied ""I don't know the boy just said he'd bring me some sauce.""  (Just an FYI ""The Boy"" is my 30 year old Philipino Manager.) As I am walking back inside my manager passes me with Karen's precious sauce she's been waiting for for all of 5 minutes. I keep trying to check on them and keep Karen's water full. Karl still hasn't touched his water except to move it off the coaster and now all the ice has melted and there's a pool of water forming around it on the table. 

Suddenly, while running around making laps between the kitchen and the patio I see Karen and Karl at the host stand and I go up to them to see if everything is ok only to be told that they have ""been waiting for their check forever"" I am completely baffled because I had just topped of Karen's water on my last lap around and she still had 2 shrimp and he still has his pasta. I once again apologise and grab Karl's credit card. Mind you Karl has not spoken a word this entire time. I bring them their receipt and continue to make my laps. Upon passing the host stand again I see the check book there. I open it up and Karl had blacked out the tip line with the pen and with some of the worst hand writing I have ever seen wrote ""worst service ever.""  Sure the service wasn't the BEST but it is the last night restaurants can be open in my city and we were busy and short staffed. 

 Before tonight I had never actually considered following a table outside and confronting them. I did take solace that they won't be able to treat another server like shit for at least 15 days. 


Tldr: almost entire restaurant staff calls of for the night and it's super busy and a couple complains about worst service and tips $0 on last night restaurants can be open in my state ( for at least next 15 days )

P.S.  The icing on the cake, my last table of the night was another 2 top apparently some famous Japanese actor (other Japanese customers kept asking for his picture) who kept me 2 hours past closing because he kept asking (3x) for ""just one last glass of wine."" They had a $450 check and tipped 10%.The last dinner service before we shut down for a minimum of 15days and almost the whole staff decided no to show up.",TalesFromYourServer

The owner decided to put out a social distance menu (she literally called it that) with jacked up pricing and claiming that if you bought one family meal, she would donate a meal to a family in need, with no intention of doing so.

"I'm a server in a Canadian province that fortunately hasn't been hit too hard by the Coronovirus (yet) but it's here and every day I'm hearing about more people that aren't self isolating after travel or feeling ill. 

I had some guests come in a few days ago and when I asked if they'd been travelling or to the airport within the past few weeks they gave me a bunch of vague non-answers and even though I was uncomfortable with their responses I sat them in the restaurant because sales are low and I didn't want to turn guests away. From hearing parts of their dining conversations it was pretty apparent that the grandmother had come over from Italy (via another province) within the past few weeks. I was pretty upset that I was purposely misled. 

Then I find out that a person that I know had a baby Friday and her snowbird mother flew in from Florida (again, stopping in another province with a high amount of cases) and went directly to the local hospital from the airport. The hospital staff asked if she'd been travelling and she LIED. Yes, lied at the maternity ward of the hospital of all places. Since then the hospitals have stopped all visitation, but this happened less than a week ago so she really should have known better. 

If people can't be trusted to self isolate and be honest at the hospital I have little hope for them being honest when they are hangry and NEED a burger. 

All of the big chain restaurants in my area have stopped dine in service but I work in a small, local place and we are allowed to remain open provided we can maintain proper social distancing and do limited seating. I was comfortable with this until the Italian grandma walked around and touched pretty much all artifacts that we have for decor. 

Don't even get me started on the man who clearly used the washroom and didn't wash his hands. That's gross at the best of times but there's no reason to not have basic sanitation standards in these times. For the record I don't make a habit of checking guests bathroom habits but we have single toilet bathrooms (not stalls) and I had just cleaned it before he went in. When he left I went in to use some febreeze and it was obvious he had taken a dump and not washed his hands. There were skid marks in the toilet but the sink was still dry from my recent cleaning and there was no paper town in the garbage bin. 

I know it's probably irrational but I'm so angry at people right now. Yesterday I turned a guest down for dine in service because I had already sat the amount of tables that I was comfortable that I could safely serve and they called my boss and left a Facebook message complaining. Small towns, right? Sorry that your lunch date was more important than my mental and physical well-being. 

For the record my boss has been great. She called me after the complaint and I was honest and we decided to do takeout only for the rest of the day. 

I'm not panicking about the virus, I'm not hoarding TP or anything and overall I'm pretty healthy so if and when it heads my way I'm pretty sure we will be okay. I want to stay open as long as possible and keep making money until I no longer can. I'm just incredibly angry at most of the people who are choosing to eat in the restaurant. 

I decided to let my boss know that i needed to take a few days off to get my head in the right place. I love serving and I've been in hospitality for years, I want to give my guests the best service possible but I don't think I can do that with how people are behaving right now. I'm certainly not looking forward to the reservation of 20 that we had this Sunday for an 80th birthday party, but I also don't expect my boss to lose sales if someone else is willing to serve them.  

Hope everyone else is doing okay out there, I know I'm being whiny and don't have it nearly as bad as a lot of people. Thank you for listening to my rant and if anyone has any happy guest stories that will restore my faith in humanity I'd love to hear them. Stay safe folks!I'm really angry and losing my faith in people",TalesFromYourServer

"Was a 6PM closer. I heard the announcement about restaurants shutting down so I had called and they said come in. We normally close at 9PM and the edict started at 9PM.

i was curious...was it a last call escort people out at 9, could we serve up until 9, what exactly was up.  Honestly I’m mad that they (State) didn’t really give any direction.

my first table a nice couple came in for dinner.

I walked  up to them and my voice cracked as I tried to make a Zombie apocalypse joke finally I had to walk away and come back a minute later after regrouping.

I told them I felt like I was in a late 1990s Y2K world ending movie, and they laughed knowing what I meant.  They were getting in their anniversary meal 2 weeks early.

Their Bill was $240. I got busy as a lot of others were coming out for their last night (the pot smelling people were actually still being turned away or made to air out) there was 1 trashy table and 1 decent table that was in for their actual birthday.

First table, paid the bill, tipped 20% then the husband palmed me a $100 and said good luck, they would ask for me when we reopened.

Birthday Table $75 on their $200.  Nice.

Trashy table was just shitty with me, we were by the way getting hammered with more then we expected and a lot of them shitty. Me and a partner had a 15 top sat, when they then sat us with 5 other tables. I took the 5 tables let my partner do the 12 top. It’s all we could do.

trashy table makes a comment to me about having to wait: I snap “I’m sorry Ma’am, when I clock out tonight, myself and everyone else you see here has to file for unemployment.”

the 12 top is getting rude I’m trying my best to help my partner. One of my tables starts vaping THC resin at the table-management says fuck no.   


The kitchen is slow, orders are coming out when they come out.

I think it’s all over and the host for some reason seats a table at 9:05. I’m like do we serve them do we not serve them? I tell the manager I do not want to ring their food in under my number since that would be a criminal/civil whatever act and I could lose my unemployment Eligibility.  He agreed to ring the meal up under his number, then transfer it to me for closing out which would show in transaction record...I’m good with that.

the 12 is just assholes. I don’t have to deal with them I’m back waiting them and running 6 tables at this point,  I get the 9:05 table‘s food out. They pay (decent tip nothing extra but they spent)

at 10PM I notice my partner is still ringing drinks for the 12 top table and My table had left. I tell him, we need to quit serving them..he bristles and I’m like we closed at 9 it’s the governments call we are breaking the law- and we have to close this whole place down for long term so do you want to be here until 1AM.

He realized that’s true and started doing checks for them.

all I could think of was that scene in ”Seeking a friend for the End of the World.”

"So here are a few income sources I've found since I've been out of work in the last week

Disaster clean up is always working and hiring. BMS CAT has locations around the country and they do fire, flood and mold clean up. It's on call work, but it's money coming in.

Anything involving trucking.  For example, Premier trucking group sells trucks and truck parts.  They have locations at least throughout the Southwest.

Shipping is huge right now.  Fed Ex, UPS, DHL. They pretty much always need package handlers.

 I know we ideally we should all self quarantine, but we don't all have the resources to do so. These jobs at least put some distance between you and coworkers.

Monday a lady asked why we only were seating every other booth and why we didn’t have more staff and customers.  We replied the virus and she said, “what is that!!!??”

"Rumors are going around that all non-essential businesses in my area will close. Meaning restaurants. Im hoping that means switching to takeout only instead of the doors closing for good.  

My manager received a message from corporate that one of our shifts(5-9) will be entirely eliminated. That leaves exactly one of us without a job unless she can change her availability to cover the rest of the shift (2-9) now that she isnt in school anymore. She never answered so we arent sure whats happening with her.  As for everyone else, all the cooks lost hours and all us servers are losing hours.  Our boss is trying to be fair about it.  He is really really trying.  

A city representative showed up and we thought he was shutting us down but funnily enough, he had a ""good to go"" sign with a city approval on it for us to hang on our window. He said he was going around to all the restaurants and buildings in the area to give out the signs for anyone who was following all the proper procedures.  Our store has definitely been trying to do our part. Weirdly, my boss had printed out giant letters spelling OPEN and had me hanging them up in the windows right before the guy got there. It was strange.  

So as of now, we are open.  Our corporation is trying. People are still coming. Its not the worst.  But it is absolutely terrifying with these rumors.  I, as well as everyone else, have bills.

"I work for a tech company that sell a variety of products such as mobile phones, headphones, etc. (not Apple).

We’ve suffered some very severe supply chain issues as of late, as Coronavirus has spread across Europe. This has severely disrupted our supply chain. It’s added time onto deliveries, and caused stock issues. 

Many of the items that we sell are what I would class as ‘non-essential’. They are tech and lifestyle items. 

But you wouldn’t think that if you spoke to our customers.

I’ve had so many conversations with UK customers who, until lockdown, were completely ignorant of the situation in China and Europe. 

They are FURIOUS that they may need to wait longer for their headphones. Or their tablet. It’s unacceptable to them that supply chains are being disrupted. Their item is more important than that. Newsflash guys: IT FUCKING ISN’T. Your smart watch is not more important than people’s health. 

I got called a ‘thief’ today because somebody’s package has been delayed in France. Very little is moving in France! 

Being English, it makes me utterly ashamed of my country. On top of the panic-buying and general selfishness I’ve seen on display this week, this has topped it. 

I don’t think the ‘Blitz Spirit’ ever existed over here. It seems more and more like PR to me every day.Online Customers at the moment- terrible",TalesFromYourServer
"We switched to carry out only on Monday. After we figured out a schedule for carry out and delivery staff and added some deep cleaning projects, we realized that there realistically aren’t enough hours for our 40 person staff. This morning I called 20 people to lay them off and instruct them how to file for unemployment.  When I was finished I wrote a schedule for the remaining staff, and then laid myself off so the company has a chance. I helped open this business nine years ago.  This shit is wild. Good luck to all of you. See you on the other side.Laid off half my staff today",TalesFromYourServer
"They’re two families, 6-8 people in total, who eat at my restaurant a couple times a month.

They’re not necessarily *rude*, but their manners are lackluster at best and they have absolutely no concept of inconveniencing their server. They had no grasp of ordering by person—splitting appetizers across parties, several “out first“ orders, and several minutes of “I want this, she wants this, but can I get this? oh and we each want this!”, etc—so it took me a solid 10 minutes to take their orders only for them to tell me *after I’d finished writing the checks* that they’d want two separate bills.

Every trip to their table involved several drink refills, new coloring sheets for the kids, various condiments, etc. I’m talkin’ four to five trips to their table in the first ten minutes alone. They’ll run you ragged without a second thought about it, and they’ll occupy their table for a solid 60-75 minutes (our turnover rate is roughly a half-hour).

I was stressed as all hell, but I didn’t miss a beat. Maximum effort. Big table = big tip. My service was *top* freaking *notch* and I was polite as could be. I was the server that I’d want to get if I ate out.

Two ~$70 checks.........one $7.50 cash tip.

I politely informed my manager that I will not serve them again.Blacklisted my first table!",TalesFromYourServer
"Take my loss as your gain
A lot of people have been asking how I’m doing, and honestly I haven’t really been able to respond.

What we are dealing with is unprecedented. It is unreal. It is something that none of us imagined for ourselves as business owners or human beings.

I am not going to sit here and act like I am fine. I’m not. Everything was ripped out of my hands in such a short amount of time that I haven’t really accepted it yet. 

I have not had more than a few days off on years and I have worked essentially 7 days week to get where I am, and yet it took just a few short weeks and 17 hours and it was all gone. 

I am not okay. This is unfair, this is devastating, this is is unconscionable. I feel like I have let down everyone I care about. Although I know I had no control. I feel like I could’ve done more to help them. I feel like I should’ve planned better, been prepared, known about this somehow.

It’s not even over for me. The two businesses here are at a screeching and painful halt and then one in Idaho is moving, but at what consequence? 

I have made some of the hardest decisions of my life and that was one was to not continue to push for sales. I may be stupid, I may pay for it later, but my god at what cost? 

We are dealing with something so much bigger than us. We cannot sit here and pretend this is not happening. Whether it’s 800 cases or 9 cases they are replicating at a rate of 3X a day. It’s math and it’s real. Deny it all you want. It’s adding up and it’s real. 

Many people are not being tested here in Seattle, so when you see 1,300 cases, trust me there are many, many more. 

If we go by the math, we simply do not have enough hospital beds for this. We don’t. People are going to die. It may not be you, it may not be your spouse or someone you live with, but it could be your friend who has asthma, or your mom who survived cancer. It could be your grandma or your diabetic son. Even if the virus doesn’t do much, the lack of help will. It’s that simple.

I am not okay losing my entire livelihood, no. I’m not okay. But I see that this is much much larger than that. This is people living to hug their kids, or talk to their grandparents. It’s people being able to go home for Christmas and going on vacation with their immune compromised sister. 

Although my business is my daily life, my responsibility, my identity. It’s my husband, my mom, my grandparents, my siblings, my nieces and nephews, my friends, their kids, my employees, my regulars and every other human on the planet that I owe this to. All of them, all of you. 

Yes, many of us have lost so much, but we haven’t lost everything yet. Please my god stay home, stay away from people, stop this now. Please make our devastating losses worth something. Please fight for us, by staying home. Please take this seriously. It is already so so serious for many of us. We have lost almost everything that matters. Almost. 

Please make this worth something and stop this from taking everything. Even if you don’t believe it, even if you don’t care about yourself, there are many of us who are already suffering beyond words. 

Help us who have already lost so much. Stay home, and please do your part to stop this from destroying what we have left. Please.For those of us who have lost *almost everything",TalesFromYourServer
"Lady orders 2 plates of pasta and a large salad togo. She swears she had a credit for the 2 pasta dishes, but her name isn't in the book. We did just switch binders so maybe it got lost, fine. She still pays for the salad ~$13. 

A large salad gets two 3oz cups of dressing. I gave her 3, she asked for 4 more. I said normally we charge for extra, but I can give you 2 more. Give her the 2, she grumbles, but accepts it. Walks out. 

I walk over to the sidework station and she comes back in saying she'll buy the 4 extra dressings and hands me her card. I say they are $0.75 each, she grumbles again, I tell her the price of 4 more, $3 something after tax and she asks if she really has to pay for it. After a pause and a blank stare I say. ""Yes, Ma'am, you do."" . She grabs her card that I set down beside the register and then asks for a manager. (I am a MOD, but have had the owner overturn my decisions with complaints so I hand it off to him)

He backs me up saying if you already have 5, yes I'm going to have to charge you for more, times our tough for our business right now. She says, ""That's unfortunate!"". Walks away a little then yells, ""I will never come back here! "". Then when shes at the door, ""I cant believe it, you guys have plenty of dressing, ughh!""

I'm not in the industry.  This was just thought that popped up in my head this morning. 

My spouse and I are on the older end, and neither of us will use the generic app based delivery services.

Would this idea be reasonable?  
At least for those servers who are able to drive and have vehicles, and those restaurants that serve dishes that aren't time sensitive.

"Today was the first day I cried. 
Today it hit me, if briefly.
Many of us miss doing what we love. 
Even when we don't love it, we have a passion for it. 
It is an enormous part of our active day. 86'd.
Just gone. Stopped. Hard pause. Uncertain. 

I miss the income, certainly, but I miss doing what I do well. I miss my hospitality family. I miss my guests, my tables, being happy to see a regular walk in, being happy to see a friend come in for an occasion. 
I miss breaking balls, being surprised at our food, learning more layers of what service means and what food can be. 
If my posts are excessively light, or giddy, it is only because I am trying to stay in shallow easy waters. I am trying to stay upright, positive, hopeful, and I want this thing to pass efficiently. 
I worry for my friends. I worry for my friends who own establishments. I worry for our industry, the repercussions and doppler effect of problems as our whole machine comes grinds to halt, not unlike a table saw shoving in the emergency brake.
Damage is inevitable.

"So I live in the UK and the pub I work at hasn't closed throughout this outbreak. We're owned by a larger company that has been on the downtrend for about a year, so they're very, very reluctant to close sites down.

Here are the recent memos we've received:
- Maximum 2 staff on every shift (our regular is 3)

- All DJs have been cancelled (our DJ nights account for 70% of our weekly revenue)

- Only accepting card payments (80% of our transactions are cash)

- All customer points - the entire pub - have to be cleaned every 30 minutes. (Not that unreasonable, but with only 2 staff on it makes long shifts so draining)

- We've been asked to keep all customers 2 meters apart from each other - about 6ft - which is pretty much impossible as it is, and would mean we would only be able to use about 5 of our tables and have max 2 people at the bar

Not to mention as we're a ""regulars"" pub, near everyone that still comes in shares the same notion that this covid-19 scare is bullshit so aren't taking any precautions. We have guys coming in that won't shower for weeks at a time, have disgusting habits as it is and have major boundary issues.

Last Sunday, we closed at 10.30pm but our last customer was at 8pm.

managers and franchise owners had a meeting this morning and decided we will stay open and be cut to 50% capacity. what does that even mean? every table has to be at least six feet apart, we can’t sit tables back to back, and then if people keep coming in what do we say? “sorry too many people, try again later.” this entire thing is just delaying the inevitable and working to spread the virus further. 

we’ll probably end up having to be closed anyway and for way longer. they said the only way we’ll close down is if the company or the government tell us we have to. it’s absolutely insane to me. 

i’m very thankful to still have my job don’t get me wrong, it’s just a catch 22. if i stay here and work, i’m getting money that i need but running the risk of spreading or receiving the virus, but if we get shut down, then i make no money but people are safe. ugh.

"I've been watching friends from Seattle to New York lose their jobs and careers in the arts and food service left and right, and rehearsals and shows have been cancelled for most performance groups I know (including one I direct).

As I arrived at my shift for St Patty's day, Governor Ige asked that all bars and clubs in Hawai'i should close in the fight against Covid19.  My restaurant will be closed for dine-in for at least 2 weeks, although I think it will be longer as I look to places like Italy and Washington. My restaurant is much more robust than most, but nobody can weather this forever. This is going to be painful both financially and socially, even structurally. I doubt most restaurants will survive without significant emergency financial assistance.

BUT.

Looking around the restaurant today on my last shift for the foreseeable future, it was obvious why the closure is necessary. Even with all the awareness about personal space and hygiene, people are people and will behave in ways that are familiar and comforting. They will hug and kiss. They will fly in from cities that are supposed to be on lockdown because there are cheap flights.They will share finger food. They will cough and not wash their hands, then use those hands to greet other people. Bluntly put, the public cannot be trusted to avoid spreading this disease of their own volition, epecially with how contagious it is.

So for tonight, I took home some corned beef and cabbage (we ran it as a special but had way too much so everybody got a double portion to go), poured a glass if quality Irish whiskey (Red Breast, aged 12 years in Sherry casks), and gave myself permission to enjoy the moment.

"My city is held up on the service industry alone. Last night the Governor declares all “non-essential” businesses stop including dining services but delivery and pick up are fine. Thankfully we have both. I am in a flexible position where while I usually serve/bartend I can cashier/prep/cook/manage/clean and get a decent hourly but the loss of tips suck. For days my GM has been denying how serious this is and refusing to believe it would hit this city this hard. Last night after the press conference I tried to talk to him but he was so fricken stubborn. “I refuse to close my dining room until an official walks through those doors to tell me otherwise!” I came into my shift this afternoon and there was a table. “You were the only ones who would let us eat in!” YEAH FOR A REASON. I’m looking for some advice as to what to do. My GM is almost never around and, according to another manager, is sick right now. I am the manager on duty so I am going to refuse any new tables but am worried about retribution from my boss.

I closed the dining room. No way in hell I was going to take responsibility for that stupidity. I am not getting my health cards revoked, a fine, or any other retribution for keeping the dining room open on my shift. I had fully planned on sending a text to the GM telling him I was doing so but got caught up helping the cashier cash out pickup orders. Didn’t need to because he called the store directly to lecture me on my “poor decision making”. I didn’t want to argue with him in front of customers so I interrupted him to tell him to call me on my cell. I spent the next 35 minutes listening to just factually wrong bs about how we don’t fear the common flu so why should we fear this. He’s done “research” so he obviously knows more than the CDC. I think what bothered me the most is how he kept bringing up “if it makes you uncomfortable...” “if you were so uncomfortable serving why didn’t you say anything earlier” “can you not handle the stress of everything?” I AM FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. Do I wish I could still take tables and make tips? Absolutely. But taking a table or two today won’t make up for me not having a job later. I ended the convo by agreeing with him. In a deadpan “Yes, GM, whatever you want” “Wait what do you mean?” “If you want me to serve tables, I’ll serve tables. And I’ll continue to do so until you tell me otherwise.” He was quite confused that I was agreeing with him but honestly I just wanted him to shut up.

"Since my governor has shut down dine-in restaurants, my workplace has been suffering. Now, I'm not really a server, but a To-Go specialist. I do To-Gos and only that. I get paid hourly, since no one really tips well on carry-out.

So, I'm fortunate because that means I'm one of the few that get picked to come in for doing carry-outs these days. However, I was given two four hour shifts this week, came in yesterday to work, and my manager sent me home after two hours. I was pissed, but I understood. Then, I get a call later, and he's telling me not to come in at all for my next shift.

This bait and switching really pisses me off. According to the online schedule, I get two more shifts next week. Probably going to be sent home those days too.

Now you might be thinking ""yeah, but what about all these servers?"" And I agree. They're doing what they can to give servers something to do to make money,  including to-gos and I respect that, but at the same time, they're giving four and five shifts to other employees, while sending us slightly newer employees home after two hours.

"Hello all! 18 year sever/bartender/manager here! I know times are tough. Incredibly tough, and my hearts and thoughts are with every one of you. For 10 years the restaurant I worked at was my home, my coworkers the closest thing to my family. This current COVID issue has hurt us all and attacked our very way of life.

That being said, don't panic. As you look for solutions, here are some thoughts I recommend:

1) Talk to your managers, and if independent, the owners. Find out if you have any accrued PTO. Here in MD they passed a law last year where even servers get PTO they build up, depending on your state, you might get that too. Aside from that, find out if they have any plans for sick leave involving COVID or similar issues. If they do, find out how payment will be dispersed, if not, start to look into unemployment options.

2) Unemployment. Each state has a different website and criteria. Google your states unemployment website and dig into your viability. In many states, Governors and state Congress has allowed for Unemployment for restaurant workers now. Apply NOW! It takes 2 weeks usually to see payment at minimum.

3) After filling, or if filing is no longer an option, seek out temp agencies in your county and state. There are many agencies placing workers even now. This is a great option for many restaurant workers.

4) If neither restaurant payment or unemployment work for you, the next step is Craigslist and social media. Start searching for gigs and hospitality jobs.

5) Aside from all that, BUILD A RESUME! It can never hurt, you have the time, and you can use it for your future. There are plenty of sites online to use as guides.

I hope each and every one of you are well, and I sit here with a great red wine thinking of our industry. Take care.Surviving the Crisis",TalesFromYourServer

They are good people though, we all still have our jobs and we can cash out our pto/sick time. That will cover rent but what about beyond?

They let us come and raid work today for all the food that will have to be tossed because of closing.

But they had told us we could negative pto but apparently now that isn't true we all have to file for unemployment. 

I honestly don't think we are gonna open in 2 weeks again I think this an indefinte thing and tbh I'll probably die from covid anyways ( I have asthma and smoke weed and cigs its coming for me) but I know in my heart we wont open so I gotta get unemployment my issue is its mayyyyybe a thousand dollars a month at most and even with having stocked up gooooood before everything went down I got maybe a months worth of food. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is be strong everyone and do what you can, I'm a 15 yr veteran in the industry and I'm fucking worried but at least my job helped me out a bit and maybe we wont all die. We will see. 

Love you my industry boys and girls. Stay strong and try to be ahead of this shit and file for unemployment now.A good/bad deal..",TalesFromYourServer
"Saturday: Owner calls an hour before close and asks me what the nights numbers are. After telling him he told me to close it down for the night. Eh, whatever
 We have been slow because people arent going out. I get it.

Sunday: Owner calls me at 7pm, asks numbers, says cut as much labor as possible, close two hours early.

Monday: Owner calls around 6pm, says the mayor is about to announce something, go ahead and close and post a sign saying we will be closed tuesday. Mayor announces reducing occupancy limits by half, capping at 150.

Tuesday: 6pm mayor announces all bars and restaurants are limited to To-Go status only. 7:30 GM calls me to say owner has said we will try To-Go for through saturday night. If it pops, I have my job. If it doesnt, owner is calling it quits.

But I never thought of how much this all was balanced on a razor's edge. 

Worse comes to worst, I have enough saved to make it a couple months. But if this thing drags out and the industry is affected for a while, idk man. I honestly didnt think it was that bad, but, here we are, all the same.

"I bartend at a tiny locally owned restaurant in an extremely small town. I have a large, very established group of regulars who I see near every shift. As you all know I'm sure, Michigan is one of the states to shut down food and bar service to carry out only which began yesterday at 3. 

All day long, I had to listen to plots and plans from people, figuring out ways to circumvent the law and ""technically"" be allowed to still drink at the bar. For 20 minutes, a couple guys sat there while the owner was at the bar proposing that he change the status to ""members only"" like the VFW or Eagles and invite the regulars to still come get wasted during quarentine. Luckily the owner is a super smart, no shit 75 year old man who isnt messing around with the virus and shut them down with the old, ""don't joke about me losing my liquor license."" 

They all talked about throwing huge parties or tailgating in gas station parking lots to play Keno and get drunk outside. Several of them are planning big st. Patty's day bashes at their houses that they refuse to cancel or alter. One 55 year old lady just booked a flight to florida and an Airbnb for really cheap and refuses to listen when anyone says that might be a bad idea. 

The common defense was that the government had 'too much control already' and they weren't gonna listen to the Man telling them ""how to live"" by begging them to stay home and safe. 

The amount of times I was asked in a smug tone, ""Well what's even the consequence for violating the GoVeRNmEnt MaNDaTe?!"" is ridiculous. I had to explain to several middle aged people that the consequence is we will no longer be allowed to do business when this ends and we'll have the weight of possibly spreading this virus on our shoulders. Of course they didnt care and still tried to intellectually bully me into admitting they ""deserved"" to keep drinking. 

All of these people are 50+, most smoke and drink every single day, and all of them kept repeating the phrase, ""I'm not scared!"" 

At 3 o'clock sharp I stopped all new service, letting my customers finish up and that's it. Of course the woman who walked in at 2:55 got snippy with me when I wouldnt give her another drink at 3:02, ""But you didnt do last call!"" Lady, last call was when you walked in and I said ""you have five minutes until I legally cannot serve you."" She ranted about how we were overreacting and then claimed that because I looked young I didn't have any authority to tell her she couldn't drink. I just smiled wide and dumped the little ice left in her glass while maintaining eye contact and then told her she should leave now since it's after 3 and she's all done drinking. I was at my breaking point by then with dismissive bullshit. 

Bar goers, we know you're going to miss your bar. You gather there as a social activity and I'm sure it seems more important than anything. That place is my livelihood, I want it open too, but I know if this weren't absolutely necessary, it wouldn't be happening.

They all want to believe this is being orchestrated by some higher power, they convince themselves *someone* is in control and they shouldnt really worry because the alternative, the fact that an uncontrolled virus most deadly to people exactly like them is ripping through our species blindly, is far too horrifying to consider. 

""Life must go on"" really doesnt apply right now because if we don't take precautions that halt normal for a bit, life quite literally will not go on. I worry for these people and all the people like them who are prioritizing selfish fun and vices over their own health and safety, not to mention the health of everyone they interact with!My bar regulars' primary focus during pandemic is how to get around the gathering restrictions and still gamble and drink",TalesFromYourServer

"Like many, we got news yesterday that we are closing as of 10pm. I worked a day shift and found out about halfway through, then...well, started drinking, lol.

Our work group chat blew up into convos about starting a foot pic empire, jokes, and tears, and most of my coworkers ended up coming to the bar, we ended up calling it an “end of the world” party(that song may have gotten played on the jukebox a few too many times)

Anyway, I know we’re all struggling right now, but I wanted to share because even through all the stress and sadness and frustration, it was such a BEAUTIFUL, wholesome night, and we all supported each other so well(and drank copiously)

We drank till the bar closed, then bought a bottle and walked around the downtown area our restaurant is in. We laughed and cried and had an amazing time with all of the people we’ve grown close to from sharing so much time and stress.

Be there for each other folks, we’re all in the same boat and we’re stronger together ❤️❤️


EDIT: I also wanted to talk about the few tables I had during my dead day shift. A few friends and couples. All tipped over 20%, honestly most tipped about 50%. They were so supportive and caring when they asked about what is going on. One of my regulars might even hook me up with a housecleaning job. And these 3 tables, it got nice out and they all moved to the patio...and these strangers at a pub in what feels like a ghost town in very strange times, began talking and sharing their stories, and it was slow so I was hanging out with them too, and it was just such a nice sense of community.

Our city just gave the order to shut down dine-ins and we’re not sure if we’re gonna stay open. We were already planning shift cuts with the reduced volume but this may push us to close for a while.

I have expected it and knew it was inevitable but didn’t realize it would happen so quickly. I had my hopes up because I had been talking to the owners about implementing an in house delivery service to help at least some employees. For now they have chosen to use an outside company which I understand from their point of view, it was quick and easy to implement in hopes to save their business through this, but I have seen a few posts now of people still tipping and supporting restaurant employees through use of to go and delivery and just wanted to bring this to attention of people that the restaurant employees themselves do not get these tips. 

It is pretty fucking surreal going into the restaurant and only having two employees in the whole place, and some of our regulars have shown their support by leaving money for servers and it’s so nice to see some good still happening in humanity.

"I’m a high schooler hosting at a family-run restaurant right now. I’ve worked there since October and haven’t had any issues; the three managers are all really understanding most of the time.

Yesterday, the other host [another high schooler but she’s a senior and I’m a junior] texted me to let me know they told her not to come in. Today, at the same time they called her out yesterday, I called in to ask if I was going to go in tonight. 


“Hi, it’s X! [other host] mentioned to me that she was called out yesterday because there weren’t enough customers due to COVID, and I was just checking in to see if that was the same case today. I’m currently visiting my grandmother and I’m about an hour and a half out from the area so I need to know ASAP if I need to head home to get ready.”

and the manager on duty basically gave me the equivalent of “yeah lmfao you’re coming in and whatever happens happens.”

Sunday, the last time I came in, they cut me after an hour and a half. I need to drive an hour and a half home, get ready, then drive there. Back in winter, they called me in and let me go in less than an hour because no one came in. I’m literally driving more home than they’ll keep me there tonight.

I have to scrub every menu that comes back to the stand, which basically means scrubbing the same two menus till the damn lamination comes off. No phones at all. They’re barely letting me keep a book on me so that I’m not bored enough to smash my skull into the host stand.

"Correct me if I’m wrong but from what I’ve been reading, Ohio and some other few states have closed down restaurants/bars but are offering unemployment and other services to affected employees.

Meanwhile down here in Texas, I work as a server at an already dying establishment. I actually landed a new job but now that’s all uncertain. I was already making only a little more than minimum wage and barely getting by as it is, then this virus pandemic happens and it’s an absolute ghost town in this restaurant.

To my understanding if someone pays cash, I hold that cash and then I owe them if I don’t get enough credit card tips to make it up, plus tip out.

"My smallish city on the edge of a rather big one (US, Northeast) just announced closure of all bars and restaurants TFN, as of tonight.  Schools, etc obviously too. My normally vibrant neighborhood is a ghost town, even by Monday night standards.

I’m a person who is fortunate enough to be able to eat out multiple times per week, at varying levels of places, and I hope self away enough to know how lucky that makes me.  I’ve worked in the restaurant business many years ago, so I’m generally very purposely strong in the tipping department. (Not doing numbers because this isn’t about me, but I have no doubt that I do it more than right by any standard.)  My guiding principle has always been, “if you can’t afford to tip properly for a meal at that restaurant, you can’t afford to eat there”.

But, even the most basic understanding of how the restaurant and bar industry in the US works tells you what an unmitigated disaster we’re in right now.  Anyone in any form of service industry (restaurant, pub, hotel, uber, taxi, hotel, air travel, retail, on and on and on), is in very serious trouble right now.  Like goddamned emergency serious, no exaggeration.

So, here’s what I saw tonight in the final run-up to the indefinite closure of restaurants in my area.  (Yes, it’s good.  At least inspirational.)

1.  Most of the people there were industry.  Probably because the place we were at was one of the very last open in the neighborhood.  The neighborhood being arguably the “restaurant row” of this side of the city.  One of the many things that makes this such a great spot.
2.  Even Mondays are typically a very decent night out here, but almost everything was closed TFN by noon today, if not by order officially as of tomorrow.
3.  The place I was at was still open by some miracle, and quite busy, probably because they were one of only two still open out of probably 10 normally open in “the square”.
4.  Soon after I arrived, sitting at the main bar, a 20-something guy next to me who we’d been talking to left a cash tip of $50 cash on a ~$30 tab.  I don’t normally notice what other people tip, and he didn’t make a show of it.  It was so unusual that the bartender checked with the guy to make sure it wasn’t a mistake.  It wasn’t.  That young guy just got it.  Maybe he was just spending his parent’s money (it’s that kind of area), but he definitely got what was about to happen to the staff there, so I don’t think much care where he got the money.  He just threw an extra $50 cash in that book and put on his coat to leave, without waiting for thank you’s or handshakes.  He was just doing it because it needed to be done, with no expectation of credit or anything.

I love that guy. He’s half my age, but I want to be him when I grow up.

We can't afford childcare if we can even find other jobs (and who knows if that will continue to be a thing), don't have any family close by, and wiped out our savings so I could stay home for 12 weeks after we had the baby. We were already existing on a tight budget.

"I know that every service industry person in the country/ world is feeling the impact of Covid-19. This is a scary time we are in, but as a friend reminded me today, the service industry is comprised of individuals who are resiliant and creative problem solvers. We have dealt with crazy customers, insane managers, and back to back doubles that drain our bodies and souls. While this event is absolutely unprecedented, I know we will make it through. 

While we try to make it till our doors reopen, there is help out there. 

Seattle service industry workers have gathered together to reach out to the community to help fill in the gaps that unemployment won't be able to fill.  If you google the title of this post, you'll find the campaign and can share it with those you know living in Seattle working in the industry.

"Its far from that...I've spoken with managers, essentially begging for their honest opinion on what the owners would do in the event of a mandatory shutdown. They said, with caution overshadowed by confidence, ""yes."" I'm now being told to file for unemployment. 

I do not blame them for their optimism. From what I've read on this thread, I am grateful for our managements' steps in disease prevention, transparency, and keeping us calm. I cannot imagine what its like to be in their position. However, FOH is officially laid off until further notice. 

We're now being told to file for unemployment in the hopes that it will make clear to the state that this industry and our reliance on our jobs are essential to the local economy. Reminding the Governor that their call for undoubtedly, reasonable social distance unfortunately has consequences, and that they must make emergency funds available to a multitude of small business employees. 

As much as I'd like to believe the state will step in and care for us, it is unlikely. This shutdown will not last a couple weeks, but months. Most of us aren't certain the Coronavirus Bill will protect this industry. Some of us have savings, but a lot of us do not. I am fucking scared.

I am relieved our state has called for shutdowns. This pandemic is serious, and we need to take action. Its a necessary sacrifice, but if we cant afford our rent/mortage we will have a housing crisis quite soon.

At this point, though our business is down about 75%, I’m grateful that we’re still operating and that at least some people are still coming out. My heart breaks for those in the service industry who don’t have a job to go to tomorrow. 
A middle aged couple came in tonight, and sat outside. They sat next to each other instead of across, in a sweet not gross way, and just seemed really happy to be there. They weren’t particularly chatty, but they asked me if we’d taken a big hit business wise this past week. I told them that unfortunately we had but that we were all just hoping for the best. I didn’t say this, but the truth is, this week has been bloody abysmal and depressing. I’m scared of what’s to come. 
Anyway, they enjoyed a couple of beers, apps, dinner and a desert. Their check was around $50. I dropped off their credit card slip, thanked them and went inside. The hostess, who cleaned off the table and retrieved the cc slip, practically ran through the restaurant to bring it to me with a gigantic smile on her face. They left me $100 tip. The wrote my name (which I never told them but is printed on the top of the ticket) and “God always provides”. My mouth dropped open and my face got all flushed and then my eyes watered up. I walked outside, but they were already gone. I wish I could tell them what an enormous difference their generous gesture of kindness made in my life tonight. I have a bill due and a vet appointment tomorrow and was really sweating it. They lifted such a weight. In what can at times feel like a thankless job, I was truly moved that these people who don’t know me and will probably never see me again cared.

I'm no stranger to being flirted with during my shifts, but you were way over the line last night. You barely had anything to drink, so you can't use being drunk as an excuse (also your drink order was disgusting, who orders half rum, half water on the rocks? What a pussy drink). I've seen you before and you've made it clear that you had your eye on me, so I knew to watch out for you, but somehow I was sat with you anyway. 

Please tell me why you thought it was ok to keep blatantly flirting with me after I dropped that I had a boyfriend and brushed it off by saying ""So? I have a girlfriend too"". Pease tell me why you thought it was ok to grab my hand as I walked by the table and grab me by the waist while I waited for my drinks at the bar even after I kept pulling away. Please tell me why you didn't pick up on my obvious discomfort as you went into detail about how infatuated you were with me. 

Did you really think that you wouldn't look like a predator to the rest of your table after I told you that I was 21 when you were easily in your mid 30's? Well apparently you didn't think that the table next to you would hear, but thank god they did. 

**To the drunk lady sitting next to them:** 

Thank you for listening in on the conversation the whole time and noticing how uncomfortable I was. As I walked away I could hear you start questioning him about why he wanted to go after a 21 year old at his age. Thank you for somehow getting up in your drunken state when he cornered me and wouldn't let me leave until I gave him my number. You got between me and him and told me to stay away from him because he's trouble (I honestly couldn't agree more). Thank you for yelling at him when he got angry at you for ""cock blocking"" him. You kept yelling about how ""She's 21"" and ""I've gotta look out for my girl"" and wouldn't back down. You were ready to get in a fight for me even after my manager broke you guys up, and I respect that so much. I didn't get a chance to thank you but god do I wish I did. You got him off my back and I can't thank you enough for that. The next time I see you I'm gonna buy you desert and tell you how much I appreciate what you did.

Not all of us are lucky and I understand that. I’m sorry.

Grocery stores and pharmacies *will* remain open, according to Inslee’s recent message. We will have time to at least prepare for time at home.

"Apologies in advance, I'm going to rant a little bit about this weekend and where I was at when this happened for the sake of context and just getting it out.

So I work weekends at a breakfast/brunch place that typically does pretty good business. I was out of town for Mardi Gras a couple weeks back, and last weekend I came down with the flu and unfortunately was not able to work. Sufficed to say, going into this weekend I was super broke, still exhausted from having been sick and I really needed to make some money.

Of course, with everything going on right now our business was impacted, and honestly my own financial issues aside I feel like this isn't the best time to be dining out anyway. So we were a little on the slow side on Friday and Saturday, and unfortunately the people that *were* showing up were... well, not great clientelle. Tips were terrible for everyone across the board, my tip percentage averaged at about 14% at the end of the day. It was really discouraging when I feel like working at a restaurant right now I'm risking my health just by coming in (my parents have been trying to convince me to stop going in), not to mention I just got over the fucking flu.

So that brings us to today, having made less Friday and Saturday together than I normally would on a Friday alone, and as the shift started we were even slower. Another server accidentally took my first table when I came in, and I told them I'd just get the next one... not knowing it would be another hour and a half before that would happen. SO a couple hours into the shift (about 1/3 of my time on the floor taking tables) and I had basically made nothing, and then we get really busy. Not quite as slammed as we normally are on Sundays, but much busier than Fri/Sat. I had already told everyone I would be super happy to pick up tables today, so I basically was running two sections throughout the whole rush. I never got in the weeds or anything, but I was definitely super busy and working **really damn hard** to try and make this weekend worth it.

Then they came in. A table of three lovely fucking people who were there for some drinks and a good time (pretty sure I've seen them come in before too), and while I feel like I was able to give them good service I was busy as hell and I'm sure they could tell. The whole time though they were just so damn nice and friendly and genuinely were making my shift better already just by being so warm. Finally they pay their bill and leave, and I go to get their last glasses and check. When I opened the book, not only did they tip 20% on the card (already a much appreciated 20 bucks), but on top of the receipt was a $50 bill. I can't even fucking tell you how much that meant to me after this past week, and along with the tables I picked up that generosity allowed me to pretty much recoup all my losses from the past two days.

I really wouldn't be surprised if they had at least been in the industry at some point. Who knows, maybe they're on this sub. If so, thank y'all from the bottom of my heart not just for single-handedly digging me out of a bit of a financial hole, but for making my weekend so much better. Otherwise, hopefully I'll get the chance to thank them in person at some point in the near future.To the literal saints that sat in my section today - thank you so much.",TalesFromYourServer

He’s nice, polite, pays for his food (or at least is willing to, enough of us know him now that he rarely does), and never causes a problem.  He’s so at risk and clearly not in good health.

"Hey all, hope everyone’s doing as well as can be during this weird period of time.  Over the last week, I’ve been watching things play out, seeing friends and family in different lines of work being told to work from home or being laid off in the worst case.  I realize that the service industry is a bit different, but I can’t help but wonder...

Why us?  It feels good to be there for some folks who need it.  I’ve admittedly got bills to pay and I’m sure you do too. That being said, I can’t help but think some people (and corporations; I will give local and small business level entities a pass because they’re in a more desperate situation) aren’t taking this as seriously as we should.  Granted, I think the media IS using the amount of low amount of knowledge possessed by the average person in this case as a way to keep people glued to the screen.  I think some of this is being blown out of proportion.  But if Karen from the other side of town is carrying the virus, and decides to come and eat at my workplace, why do I have to risk the potential of getting sick?

So once I was working at the drive-thru windows at my store and a car came up.  I leaned out of the window, greeted the customers and told them how much their order was. The daughter in the passenger's seat suddenly looked at me and laughed, telling me that I looked like an elephant.  Then the father/driver laughed at her comment and called me 'fat boy'.  Should I point out that both of these people, along with the family members who were laughing at the comments in the back seat, were also heavy-set?  Yes, I think I should.

Of course all I could do was to totally ignore there comments and get their money.  But I wish to Dog that I had been able to tell them to lose some weight themselves by not having this dinner and drive off.Drive-thru insults",TalesFromYourServer

"I work in a fine dining restaurant. Last night, there was a table of 5 in another server's section. Mom, dad, two teenage boys, and another woman.

Throughout the night when I've passed by this table, I have heard the dad berating the younger boy (around 13 yo). I'm only passing by the table so I only hear bits and pieces each time. He kept calling his son a dickhead or an asshole and ""I can't wait until you are 18 so you can move out, and you can go live under a bridge"". The son is quiet each time and I don't hear him say much.

I see that surrounding tables are uncomfortable with hearing these things but I let it go because it's not my table nor my business.

Until it started to get physical. The dad suddenly starts to shove and push his son, nearly pushing him out of his chair. I literally sprinted to the table and reached my arm out to block the dad from further physical contact. 

""Sir! You CANNOT do that here""

""I can't do that here!? He's my son""

""Sir, there are other tables in this restaurant""
(What I meant was, ""your behaviour is disrupting the other tables in this restaurant"", but I was too flustered and not good with words so I didn't word it properly)

I then turn to the son and ask if he is ok, to which he paused, and then replied yes.

I leave the table immediately to go find a manager. Luckily, one walks by and I explain the situation to her, while the dad puts on his jacket and storms out.

I tend to my other tables (I have a full section) and did not have time to find and explain to the server what just happened at his table.
The mom demands that the server cancel her husband's dinner.

The server was like ""no problem, is everything ok?""

""No!""

""Oh...is your husband not feeling well? Is he coming back?""

""NO""

""Ok, is there anything I can do to help?""

""NO!""
(Lol the poor, poor server)

Funnily enough, no other staff member witnessed what happened, but other tables did. There was a table next to them that requested to move, shortly after what happened. They were sick of hearing the verbal abuse. They sung praises to my manager about me for standing up for the son.

One of my own tables complimented me as well as I was taking their payment at the end.

Both managers were on my side and were glad I had interfered, which I'm grateful for. I reacted so fast that I didn't have time to evaluate potential consequences to my actions and I'm so glad it did not escalate any further. My heart remained pounding for the following hour and I was sick to my stomach for 2 hours. I can't remember the last time I had a ""fight or flight"" adrenaline rush.

Anyway, the rest of the family remained and finished dinner, and the server said the women were obviously embarrassed but chose to mask their embarrassment by being rude/bitchy. They still tipped 20% which is amazing. I would've given the server money out of my own pocket had they not tipped him well since I interfered with his table. Glad it worked out financially.

BUT my real concern is for the boy. Whatever we witness in public means it's 10x worse behind closed doors. I hope he didn't get beaten half to death when he returned to the hotel room. I'm glad I interfered because I would've regretted it for the rest of my life if I hadn't, but I really hope I didn't make his ""behind closed doors"" situation worse.

We watched on the big screen in horror with our customers. One fucker told us 'have a nice vacation' when he walked out. No, I won't be, I will be stressing at home when there is not one case of corona where I live and people can choose to go to a restaurant anyway. We do not NEED to close. I watched one of my colleagues cry and I had a breakdown myself. I also got a lot of free veg because they didn't bother to tell us until 30 MINUTES BEFORE that all of our stock couldn't be used for the next 3 weeks.

And all I'm seeing on twitter right now is people making jokes about the queues outside coffee shops (which is another problem, those addicted will go to street dealers now) and knobheads who work in an office going 'yeah this is great' not realising that thousands of people's livelihoods are now at stake. Yes, Karen, it's great that our restaurant who was sending anyone who even had a cold home anyway is closing. It's great that a lot of places will go completely bankrupt or ask for loans, causing strain on the banks. It's great that a lot of people might go homeless or can't afford basic necessities.

"I don’t know if this is the place to put it but I work as a server in a small restaurant in Florida. I think we’re around 100 cases of coronavirus last time I checked the news. Most places are temporarily closed for 2 weeks, and we may be as well. Business has been slow but today a customer came in and ordered to go. 

Everything was fine except he was sick and coughing, and didn’t seem to understand English well so I wasn’t able to talk with him well. He was coughing heavily and I understand if you’re sick, but he didn’t seem to care that he was as he didn’t make an effort to cover up his coughs, and then started coughing on the chairs and around our host counter too.

He didn’t make much of an effort to try to stop from coughing around the restaurant, and I didn’t want to offend him so I tried to ask him politely if he could be aware of what he was doing, and if he could avoid coughing everywhere or try his best to cover his coughs. So even if he was sick, that our other customers wouldn’t get sick too. 

I’m not sure if he understood it or not, since he only spoke Spanish and knew only a small amount of English. I wasn’t sure what else I could do, so I just got him his to go order and tried my best to clean up the areas that he coughed in. Even without the pandemic of coronavirus going around, in general I would still have been concerned if a customer was doing this on purpose or not.

"I manage a busy counter service cafe which is located in the UK, in an outdoor location. Whilst business in the area is slowing down, I think our location is drawing local people in who have decided to stay off work. We are so busy. People are being so incredibly filthy, and so are their children (although I don’t blame them). Running around , touching everything, *licking* menus and table markers, bringing dogs into the restaurant, throwing rubbish straight on to the floor.

I have been in early and out late the last week trying to combat this virus, to put plans and signage in place that will stop the risk of infection. I have held meetings and given advice to all staff, who are breaking their backs to keep the place sanitary *and* efficient. And no one cares!! I had to stop a man shouting at a young employee today because she didn’t deliver the correct food to his table. He was pointing at her and leaning over her, raised voice and arms up. He told us we didn’t care, he made her cry and me cry, because we have done nothing but try and try to look after everybody here. Including him. 

Any advice? I have signage and good cleaning practices in place, and I am speaking to customers where I can... but we seem to be fighting a losing battle against common sense and decency.

"I just finished training  in a cafe located in a public market that happens to also be a popular tourist destination. The cafe area is about 2m by 3.5m, so it is tiny, but we serve over 500 customers a day. We don't have our own seating, but we do have self-serve drip coffee and espresso machines. We hand customers the size of cup they want, and they can fill it up with either medium, dark, or decaf coffee.

Yesterday, we made changes to how that works because of COVID. The coffee jugs have a handle on top that customers pump to dispense coffee. They used to face the customers, but they now face towards the cafe so baristas have to pour coffee for the customers. This is because we don't want customers touching ANYTHING other than the card reader. Not even the milk jugs. We are pouring EVERYTHING for them.

Then, this elderly man comes. I recognise him as the man who pays for a small cup of coffee, pours a very tiny amount of coffee, then empties the milk jug into his cup. He orders a small cup of coffee, then looks very confusedly at the new setup. I explained to him that we now have to pour everything for him. All customers have complimented us for this... except for him.

He tries to grab the cup from my hand, and wants to pump the coffee himself. As I was holding the cup in my hand, he dispenses a cup-full of FRESHLY BOILING coffee onto my hand. I shout a little ""OUCH"", but he keeps on telling me that he wants to do it himself. I tell him, ""Sir, we are not allowing customers to touch anything, not even the handles!"".

Thank goodness my manager was there and she took over his order. She tells me to run my hand under cold water and take a 5-minute break. It's been a chaotic day with all that new setup and protocols. I guess she's known about him for a while because I didn't hear anything from him when he left with his coffee.

For the 5 hours remaining in my shift that day, I had a red mark on my left hand, but my generous manager added $5 to my tips as a ""training bonus"" and sent me home that day with a pound of coffee beans.Customer burns my hand because he wanted to serve coffee himself",TalesFromYourServer

I work in a small restaurant with only 5 waiters. 2 of them are off sick for a week (this is what my boss is allowing them to take off.) One has a daughter that recently travelled and had a cough and a fever. We've all worked in close proximity to one another within the past week, and now that 2 are in isolation, the 3 of us are the only ones left. I was told that I'm not allowed to call in sick because we will not be shutting down.

I also got yelled at for washing my hands too much. Because I was using too much paper towel and using up our shared sink. And we dont have hand soap, meaning my hands are literally bleeding from using harsh dish soap.

I have so many problems with this place, including being scheduled 3 shifts a week (always the slowest shifts because our head waiter makes the schedule, so my schedule changes day to day depending on her whim) despite quitting my other job to work there full time. On the weekends I work a 4 table section (2×2 tops and 2×4 tops) while the head waiter works a 13 table section (3x2 tops and 10x4 tops). Despite all her tables im always doing her shit for her, and she doesn't even clean before she leaves. I've been barely scraping by being tossed the shittiest shifts and shittiest section and I've been waiting for summer to find a new job.

"This is a lil lengthy but I wanted to explain the situation.

I am a server at an Asian restaurant in Michigan. We are busy all year round but especially during the high tourist season of June-September. I've worked there about two and a half years.

This business does a great amount of take-out. In the last two years, the only two other Asian restaurants in this town have closed and take-out has exploded. Front of the house is expected to answer phones and take orders and also cash take-out orders out if/when we have a chance. Taking orders itself deserves combat pay. We will regularly field calls from people who are not familiar with our type of cuisine and need walked through the menu. Or people who decide to wait until they place the call to ask all 8 people they're ordering for what it is they want. But I digress. After we take the order, back of the house puts it together i.e bagging and packaging everything. Front of the house is then primarily responsible for cashing the person out when they arrive. We do not have a host/ess. 

The issue is, front of the house does the work but we are not cut into the take-out tips. The family who owns the business has a policy of ""donating"" all to-go tips to charities in their home country. There is a big tip jar near the register with a sign that says ""Take Out Tips!"" in bold lettering and under that in finer print there is the explanation that all to-go tips are donated. This has been their practice for years but as take-out business has exploded, resentment among the staff is growing. Quite frequently, dealing with takeout issues takes time from serving our tables. If a day/night is particularly slow, sometimes the majority of what we do is handling take-out orders. 

Sometime last year the manager (one of the owner's daughters) told me they are no longer donating to the particular charity indicated on the tip jar's sign and instead will be donating ""locally"". I very strongly believe they aren't donating anything at all. One of the servers who has been there for many years said something to the owner about our frustration regarding this issue and they gave us each $200 last Christmas. It's a nice gesture but they make at least $200 a WEEK in togo tips. We cash people out, we see what they leave. 

This has affected our level of service as no one rushes to help people waiting for to-go orders and sometimes the phone will ring and ring as we just refuse to sacrifice our table service (what makes us money) for a to-go order. We resent these customers and I'm not going to pretend I haven't been openly rude to people who just want to pick up their food. Adding insult to injury, people throw their money in the jar thinking the person cashing them out, who is helping them, that they are getting a cut of the tip (no one reads the very lengthy explanation of ""donation"" practices) when we very much do not. 

It's their business and I guess they can do what they want. However, I'm increasingly uncomfortable doing work I'm not being paid for. 

I'm not sure how to approach this. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Any advice?Take-out tip trouble",TalesFromYourServer

"Back 25+ years ago, I was working a Saturday night at the burger/sub/pizza shop in a tourist area.  I had an extended family come in and take up pretty much my entire patio section. It was 2-3 married couples and all their kids (8-10 kids).  The kids took up 2 tables while the parents took one.  Usually, I ask if the parents are going to order for the kids (1-2 large pizzas for them?) or if they will order themselves.  I was told that they could order what they wanted.  Kids probably ranged from 14 down to 3 or 4. I was surprised when the older kids were super helpful to the younger kids and it was actually surprisingly easy to get their order.

I made it a point to tell the parents that after serving 3 years of summers at that restaurant, those were the most well-behaved kids I had ever waited on and they should be proud of how they all acted together.  They thanked me profusely and left a decent tip.  The kids heard me say that too and a couple of older ones said thanks.  One of the dads announced that due to how well they acted, they were going to get frozen custard down the street after dinner.  As they were leaving, one of the parents came back and palmed me another $20 and said thanks again.

"I’m here to vent out my frustrations over my day. One tables $80 bill where I was tipped $1.25. Another tables $120 bill where I was left $5.
The table of 6 who’s bills totaled over $300, they combined a tip of $10, each buying starters and prime rib. I was told by my manager that they do this every time they come in. It’s a slap in the face, considering I have to tip the kitchen 10% of my total food sales. I gave them excellent service, and I was proud of myself. Today I rang out just over $2000, &amp; what did I take home, $120. Corporations suck, people are terrible. I was proud of myself for handling a busy day, but I’m just so bitter over this restaurant and how unfair it is that I’m constantly dipping into my personal money over selfish people who chose not to tip.If you can afford beer, a starter and prime rib for yourself, you have enough for a tip.

When she arrived back, I placed it in front of her. The soup was noodles, seaweed and broth, with the shrimp on the side to be added or dipped in. She immediately said ""Uh uh, I don't do seaweed."" I told her I could have the chefs remake her soup with no seaweed. At this point, she also points out with a frown, ""and my shrimp is cold!!'

It’s the biggest money maker of the year for both the restaurant and for a lot of the staff. Even though our parade this year was cancelled, people still showed up Probably close to 200 people crammed inside a small bar and 150 people outside of the bar.

She always ignores me and gives me the cold shoulder. She NEVER initiates with me or tries to talk to me. Whenever I try to talk to her or start a conversation, she is very short with me and she puts out a vibe like I am bothering her. When I walk in in the morning and I say good morning to her, she ignores me.

She avoids eye contact with me a lot, but on the rare occasion that we do make eye contact, she rolls her eyes at me. When me and a few of my coworkers are having a group conversation and I am speaking, she won't even look at me to acknowledge me speaking. When I respond to something she says or ask her a question she looks at my coworker next to me as if they are the ones speaking to her and asking her questions.

She is only like this towards me. She is very warm and friendly to everyone else. I don't know what it is about me that puts her off? I have been nothing but nice and respectful to her like I am with everyone else.

I just lost my job. I want to rant.

Tldr I got fired because I ASKED to speak about not working at a restaurant infected with the coronavirus.

I left my last job about a week ago for a better job, from a Bistro to a 2 star Michelin restaurant. I bought a nice jacket(500$) to work in. I figured it would be an investment.

Well, due to the coronavirus and the continual loss of clients, I was moved over to their bistro right next door. Now, I work in a bistro again and I cannot use this expensive vest. No biggie, it's great jacket that I'll use sometime later in my life or when I get moved back to the Michelin started restaurant, and most importantly, I still have job.

Today, they( the head chef) told the bistro team that they have to work in another restaurant belonging to the owner, since the bistro's business has also been slow. Cool, no problem right? Except, this other restaurant has TWO THIRDS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ON SICK LEAVE DUE TO FEVER. I know this because management mentioned it to all of us earlier in a group meeting.

So, being honest, I text my wife and tell her the news. SHE IS NOT WITH IT(she would lock me outside my house if I had gone). I knew I had to talk to HR about it but had no clue to whom exactly because I just started working there. I walk into HR and ask to whom could I speak to? Right when I finish asking the question, the head chef appears right behind me. I ask him, "" Are you the one I should speak to concerning the switch because my wife-"" He interrupts, "" Does your wife make decisions for you?"" I was taken back, I didn't know what to say to that. He then fired me on the spot.

The server apologized and went to tell our manager. Manager went by and the man told her that we were “over staffed and something needs to be done about that.” Manager apologizes comped his food to get him out asap.

"I work at a nicer restaurant in LA, where there is already a significant outbreak. Schools and colleges are closing, events are getting cancelled, and the numbers of actual cases are likely much higher than reported due to extreme lack of tests.

Two servers at my work have called out for the last few days with flu symptoms. One of them is scheduled to work tonight and she hasn’t released her shift or called out yet, and she’s spoken about not being able to get tested. 

I don’t feel comfortable going to work at this point. I’m young and healthy, but I still don’t want to risk getting pneumonia or being the reason someone’s grandma dies because I get the virus and spread it. For me, getting someone their $20 hamburger isn’t worth disregarding the social distancing procedures recommended by public health officials. 

I got my shifts picked up through the weekend to buy some time, but I don’t know what to do after that. There’s a really cavalier attitude about it among most of the other servers and especially the managers, so I don’t know how to bring up my concerns. I’m very lucky in that I have enough savings and other income sources to make it for a while without any shifts, but I don’t want to lose my job over this.

Is anyone else feeling the same way? It seems like no one in the restaurant industry thinks this is a big deal...Two servers at my restaurant have “the flu”. I don’t feel comfortable going to work anymore.",TalesFromYourServer
"i’ve been hosting for two years and plan on being a server pretty soon (once i turn 18). everyone i know that serves started out as a busser, dishwasher, or host. i know that it’s possible to start off as a server but not at all realistic and pretty damn rare. Now this guy told me he’s applying at a restaurant to be a server, he said that because he’s a football player that shows character and there would be no reason for them not to hire him 😐 fast forward to now and of course he didn’t get the job. so i told him just go back and apply as a host and he said he refuses to work for under $14 and hour? he grew up with money so that just adds to his mindset on this but he will not listen to me when i tell him it just does not work how he thinks it does. he also said serving is extremely easy and no experience should even be required. literally saying “it’s easy. all you do is take orders and bring them the food what’s so hard about that?” now i know it’s not super hard or anything but that’s just disrespectful to anyone who serves for a living.it’s rare to get a serving job without any experience. am i correct?",TalesFromYourServer

"I've been serving for a few years, work at a sports bar/bowling alley hybrid now and for some things it's easier to just let the customer have their way. For situations like with our drinks ($4), or in this case, our $10 cover charge for UFC.

So this night, I finally get my first table, a couple hours after the fights have started. They already have drinks and some food, so I ask if they were bowling or in the arcade before they were sat (no cover charge in those areas because UFC isn't shown there). Nope, they were playing pool. No sweat.

So I ask if the server they had already charged them, and one girl claims they were never even told. So I explain it's $10, and that's when she makes the mistake of telling me she's not paying it *because* she wasn't told.

Again, to reiterate, normally I'd just let it slide, just ""forget"" to charge them, but if someone wants to tell me how things are gonna go, they can fuck right off.

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I have to charge you.""

Her: ""I'm not paying it.""

M: ""If you're not paying then I can't let you sit here.""

H: ""Well I don't even want to watch the fight.""

M: ""We have other tables outside the restaurant that don't have cover charge if you'd like.""

H: ""Well why do you guys put it on every TV if there are people who don't want to watch it?""

M: ""Ma'am, even if we put it on a single screen, you'd be able to watch it from any corner of the restaurant.""

Worth pointing out that we have movie theater sized projector screens in our restaurant.

That's pretty much where the argument ended. She went back and forth about not paying, I finally told her she can pay or leave, so she left.

Edit: wow, uh, I went to sleep and now I have a 1k+ post. I'll start responding lmao

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit2: Okay so after my nap, and a lot of valid comments, I realize I left out a lot of important details. I did post this after an all nighter before a test, my bad.

So, our building is a logistical nightmare, for a lot of reasons. We do the best we can, but we are not set up to give top quality service to the amount of people we serve. Yet somehow, this place has trudged on and remained hugely popular for over a decade.

**1. Collect at the door/host stand:**

Unfortunately not possible for us. We can hit max capacity (can't remember the number but it's definitely over 1000) ~~within an hour~~ really quick on events like these, and it does happen pretty often. We have no lobby, so combining that with a massive influx of people means that a huge line would form. Outside.

There are also multiple entrances to the restaurant to cover, and they're all major walkways that would get gummed up with people.

**2. She had a right to be upset, being told after her group had already ordered.**

Normally I'd agree! What I didn't say in the post is that it's unlikely she wasn't told before the went to a pool table. She also didn't personally have a drink yet.

My best guess is that she was lying, or, less cynical (and more likely), she managed to slip into the restaurant unnoticed, after the rest of her group went through a host stand to get to the pool table (It's basically impossible for a whole group to make it inside unnoticed). Meaning technically she wasn't told, but the rest of her group was and never said anything to her.

Worth pointing out that no one else in the group argued, she was the only one who left, and after she left, the rest just went back to their pool table, paid the cover charge and enjoyed their food and the fight.

The point of the post was more to focus on her attitude. She never argued anything about ordering already, she just told me she was not gonna be charged, without any questions and assuming I would just comply.

Again, I didn't make any point of this in the post, but we deal with massive amounts of people, all the time. We get all sorts of shitty customers because of this. Maybe the jury is out on what sort of guest she was, but I'm convinced she wasn't, and this is coming from someone who will turn their belly up and surrender to basically any table because I don't want anyone to leave upset.

"Hello, first time poster and this is a long one so bear with me please! Make sure you’ve got some time to spare but if not there’s a tldr at the bottom! 

I was a server for 5 years, through sixth form and university, at several different restaurants. I was very lucky and never experienced a really terrible manager until my last few months of serving. He was rude to both staff and customers and just a generally horrible person. I ended up handing my notice in 3 months earlier than I planned as I decided I’d rather be broke during my last few months of uni than work with him. 

Today I stumbled upon the email I sent to the general managers of the restaurant and also the owners of the  restaurant (it was a small family run business so I knew the owners fairly well) and it brought back all the memories from back then. It is probably worth noting that I was in my final few months of uni when I sent this email so I was heavily procrastinating from doing my dissertation which is probably why I wrote such a lengthy email. 

A few weeks after I sent this email the horrible manager was fired. So if you ever have a terrible manager it sometimes is worth saying something. So please enjoy this mammoth email I sent, maybe some of you can relate. 

HM = horrible manager 
FOH = other servers 

Dear [MANAGERS/OWNERS], 

I am writing to you all to express my concern at the behaviour of HM. 

I am aware that I am unfortunately leaving very soon so my opinion of him and the working environment he creates may not be that important but I feel the points I am going to raise effect all staff members and it is unfair on them to have to work in such a negative and uncomfortable environment. 

Firstly, he often shouts at us on shift. I don’t know if he is aware he is raising his voice or not but either way it isn’t exactly nice. Customers often look in our direction as he is doing so visibly uncomfortable and confused as to why they are sat watching a manager shout at his members of staff, often for not really doing much wrong or simply making an innocent mistake. After witnessing [FOH] being verbally attacked by HM for doing nothing wrong a customer even offered to punch HM in the face for her. This should paint you a picture of how he acts in the restaurant. 

On a similar note he talks to us as if we are about 5 years old in a very patronising way. If I am doing something wrong I have no issues with someone coming to me and letting me know and maybe advising me on the correct way of doing it but they way HM goes about it is pretty rude. I have worked for [restaurant] for nearly a year and a half now so know what I am doing most of the time much like most of the other staff members but we are constantly being made to feel like we are stupid and not doing our jobs properly when we know we actually are. Feeding into this is the fact that he constantly wants everything done in his particular way and how he likes even though everyone has been working there longer than him and it has worked perfectly fine before he arrived. I understand sometimes change is good but there is no need to be patronising about it. He even made mini posters of rules for the glasswash and the host desk. The glasswash rules contradict everything I do when I am on the bar yet somehow for the year and a half I have been working on that bar everything has gone smoothly. So I don’t see why I have to change every single thing I do just to do it exactly how HM likes it when it doesn’t affect the service the customer is receiving or the efficiency in which the restaurant is run. On the topic of these posters, while he was making them he left [FOH] to deal with a full restaurant downstairs with a few tables upstairs alone having to handle the door, taking orders, making drinks, doing relay and running food. This is unfair and a clear lack of leadership and support on his part. 

Not only does he talk to us in this way but he also does it to customers which is extremely unprofessional. He talks to them as if they are children in a patronising tone and as if they are stupid. They don’t know the inner workings of [restaurant] and our till system but HM seems to think they do. For example on a breakfast shift I am sure you are all well aware that when you add a main meal to an order on the modifiers page that pops up there is the option to add a free tea or coffee. We all know this as we use these tills, the customers do not. I don’t seem to find it hard to politely ask between each food order if they want any tea or coffee with that meal or if the customer is quickly listing through the meals I often find it no issue to just do the food first and then manually bring the modifier list up for each order and add the teas and coffees at the end. This may take 10 seconds more but it really is no issue. However, HM seems to think this must be a huge issue as when a customer is ordering breakfast he seems to think they should know they have to order the tea or coffee with every meal and if they don’t he will speak to them as if they are stupid and rudely interrupt them in an almost shouting tone saying something like okay stop do you want any tea or coffee and if they say can we just do food first he will look at them as if they just asked the dumbest question in the world and say no I just asked do you want any tea or coffee. That’s a pretty unprofessional way to talk to our customers in my opinion. 

On the topic of customer service HM seems to think doing anything more than the bare minimum for a customer is too much to ask. For example, I am well aware that we run counter service at our restaurant and that is absolutely fine but on the odd occasion when someone has ordered lots of drinks that will take a couple minutes to make it is much easier for myself and potentially whoever is on counters and also a much better experience for the customer if we politely offer to let them go back to their table and we’ll pop the drinks over to them when they are ready. Not only is this just a simple way to improve the service a customer is receiving but it also avoids holding up a queue of people and having someone loitering around the bar area and in the walkway. However, HM is very against us doing this and even shouted at myself and [FOH] on saturday morning when we offered to pop a tables drinks upstairs for them when they were ready. This was a walk in of 8 who had ordered 5 different floats, a draught beer and a couple soft drinks. I had 2 customers in the queue behind them and figured rather than holding those customers up [FOH] could make the large tables drinks and run them upstairs while I finished serving the remaining customers in the queue. This was a big problem to HM though as when we asked him for help to carry the tray as it was quite heavy he decided to loudly scold us about the fact we shouldn’t be offering to do this for customers as we don’t do table service. How does that look to customers around the bar? It looks like we are trying to do everything we can to not help them. 

Another thing that I find very unprofessional is that I have heard him on multiple occasions expressing his negative thoughts about [only female supervisor] and the way she runs the restaurant on a weekday morning to other members of management. He never names her but when you say supervisor and she in the same sentence it isn’t exactly hard for those within hearing distance (which when HM is talking is approximately the whole restaurant most of the time) to piece that puzzle together. Not only is this unprofessional but it is also rude. He shouldn’t be discussing his opinions of other staff members on floor and that should be kept to meetings where this sort of thing is required to be discussed. 

I know you have been made aware of this already but he took shifts off of OP and [FOH] (and I don’t know who else) without consulting us first. This isn’t okay. I know it was only one shift for me so I’m not going to try and make a big fuss about it but for [FOH] it is a bigger deal. She is a full time member of staff and had her hours for one week cut down to 26 hours without even being asked. As our manager he should respect us and at least talk to us before doing things like this. If there were no hours for the new girl why hire her yet, surely it would make more sense to give her hours in the new rota or create a few open shifts for her before the new rota is done. 

Finally, on several occasions he has made inappropriate comments to female staff members, some of which are barely 18 or has said creepy comments about young girls and women in general. He has quizzed me on my sexuality on shift once which made me uncomfortable as I didn’t really know a polite way to say can we stop talking about this please when he shouldn’t have really been talking to me about that anyway unless I was the one to bring it up. This is once again unprofessional and creates an uncomfortable working environment for everyone. 

I hope these comments don’t come off as rude or spiteful I just want to try and get my opinion of the whole situation across to you. I don’t wish to attack HM as a person but I am trying to show how his behaviour as a member of management or as a team member in general is unprofessional and unnecessary. I am not naming any names but I know of several team members who are planning to look for jobs elsewhere due to his behaviour. Everyone’s morale has dropped significantly in the past couple months due to his behaviour and the working environment he creates so it would be beneficial for everyone if this could be resolved.

If you need me to clarify anything do not hesitate to let me know. 

Kind regards, 
OP

"I (F/22) recently started working at a mid-volume family restaurant as a host. Last night, I sat down two well-dressed middle-aged gentlemen, brought them water, and told them the server will be right with them. Since the host stand is right next to their table, they spent the next hour talking to me about their families, business ventures, and golf trips. All the while, they were ignoring the server (M/31) and took forever to order food.

Since I'm new, I wasn't aware they were flirting with me until right before they left. One of them looked me in the eyes, smiled, and said ""You remind me so much of my wife when she was young, tall and beautiful"". He handed me $20, told me to keep it, and walked out. When I talked to the server, he said he got stiffed by those two at the table. I have never felt so guilty before, it's almost like I stole the tip from him. I immediately gave the $20 back to the server.

"It was a pretty busy Sunday morning at the restaurant that I worked at that specialized in breakfast. I had a mother and daughter come in and order pancakes, eggs (over easy), and bacon. Everything was going fairly normal. I brought out their food, and asked if everything looked okay. And then...

The mother looked at me and asked, completely seriously, if her eggs were from a carton.

Let me repeat that. She asked if her over easy eggs, with intact yolks, had come from a carton. 

I explained that, no, we buy eggs locally and if it was from a carton the yolk wouldn't still be unbroken.

She continued, saying that ""real eggs are orange, not dark yellow"" so they must have come from a carton. 

I genuinely didn't know what to say, so I left to get our shift leader. By the time we both got back to the table, they had walked the check. I will never understand how this woman got that far in life.

"So this lady called in an order, it was a calzone and a salad. After I got her information she asked how long it would take, I told her at least 25 mins - our calzones are huge and always need at least 25-30 minutes to cook.

She heaves a long suffering sigh and says she doesn't want to wait that long and cancels her order. Ok, whatever.

About a half hour later this lady storms in and asks if we have her order ready. We realize it's the lady who cancelled, and tell her no, sorry, we didn't make it - because you didn't want it???

She said she got a text her food was ready so she wants her food now. I explain that sometimes when an order is cancelled after being sent to the kitchen and the kitchen has to delete it, the system thinks the order is complete and will alert the customer the food is ready. So, there is no order, sorry about the confusing text, you didn't want it so we didn't make it.

"Went to a saki/sushi place last night late, it was out in the suburbs. I'd never been there before but, as a vegetarian, you can usually get a vegetable roll without much trouble. Plus warm saki on a cold night seemed nice. 

It was after nine, probably 9:30 p.m., but the open sign was lit up. 

I had my phone and headphones at the ready. I normally eat alone and I enjoy podcasts but the waitress, Kim, introduced herself and asked me my name and then proceeded to hover around me to a degree that seemed overly familiar. After I ordered warm saki and a roll and she brought me, without me asking, two packets of green tea--no hot water. She told me how delicious the green tea is (the packets are literally marked with the most generic green tea logo you'd imagine) and she asked me to tip her in cash so her manager couldn't take a cut. 

I told her I don't carry cash. 

She then told me how I could use cold green tea packets for my eyes (I don't know the details) on my eyes to relax. Again, she hovered and asked when I'd be back. 

To note, she seemed older. As am I. 

I'm 42 and while not weirdly disfigured or misshapen also just a regular guy, in no way notable or overly attractive. I generally go without note from the opposite gender and I""m fine with that--I have a GF and whatnot so I'm not seeking anyone's attention. 

Anyway, TLDR she left her schedule and her name on my receipt and I""m curious if that plus her request for cash, plus the fact that she'd repeat my name at every interaction is a sign of anything untoward? Is this some kind of weird prostitution thing? It was by far the most unusual interaction I've had in the US (and having traveled to Asia I'm used to the weirdly forward nature of sex workers there and this KIND OF reminded me of that). 

The whole experience was very off putting to the point where I'll certainly never go back and while I never write reviews, I kinda want to write one because it was ... odd to say the least.

Now NO MATTER WHAT he responds with, reply excitedly, “That’s my Dad’s name!” If you can somehow ask if he has children around your age, that doubles the shame factor. I have yet to have this backfire, and some of my coworkers have adopted the practice too, with great success.!!YOUNG FEMALE SERVERS!!

"Alright there’s a TL;DR at the bottom, i’m on mobile, be warned if you don’t like swearing, yadda yadda here’s what happened.

There’s a rather old guy (I’ll call him Dave) that comes into (about once a week) the small local restaurant I host at. He is usually polite for a few minutes before he starts to break out dirty jokes with the servers, bussers, and of course me and the other hosts. He can become really vulgar sometimes but we all just smile and nod and be as polite as possible because he is a “regular paying customer” and “just some old man that doesn’t know better.”

This guy loves to distract us all and talk to us for AGES while we are working. Wether he is showing us tik toks/facebook memes on his phone or just telling us vulgar jokes, he loves to chat and it can be incredibly hard to get away from this guy politely once he decides he wants to talk to you.

Now maybe the guy is just lonely, and his excessive talking is not a problem when we are slow or the person he is speaking to is an adult, but there are times when this guy REALLY tests my patience. I may be an asshole for my feelings towards the guy since he’s just some lonely old dude, but I digress. 

I was annoyed when he made disgusting jokes along the lines of “eating out women” to a 16 year old busser, but it was brushed off as the busser does look older than she really is and he is just trying to talk right? We were slow at the time anyways so it didn’t matter. 

But that same night, whitest he had decided to eat chips and drink soda in front of the TV and a sports game for an hour and a half later, we really got busy. People started filling in fast and pretty soon there was a short wait time for tables. 

Of course, when I am the busiest I would be that night, he decides to leave. Which is fine, he just has to wait in line. 

Keep in mind the space at the front of the restaurant is small and cramped with people in line to pay and people waiting to be seated.

Dave makes it to the front of the line and starts to just *GO OFF*. He is telling me dad jokes left and right and won’t give me his bill so I can ring up his order and charge him. The people behind him are starting to groan, and I am doing my best to smile and politely get his shit taken care of. 

I finally get ahold of his bill after what seems like ages and ring up his order, but instead of giving me his card he says he has to show me a “few facebook memes!” instead. I politely say “Sir I apologize but I will have to see it next week as theres a line.” 

It is as if I never said anything at all. He shows me a facebook picture making some dark humor joke about disabled people/vegetables and proceeds to try and break it down for me. My patience is literally almost gone at this point and everyone in line is getting pissed off. He has been holding up the line for about 5-8 minutes now, which when we are busy is a _LONG TIME_.

I tell him I have seen enough and that he either needs to pay now or I will be seeking assistance from my manager due to a hold up in the line. Dave has the gall to say “Oh I didn’t even notice haha my bad!” And finally gives me his damn card. 

I swipe it as fast as I can and try have him sign even faster, but instead of signing he decides to ask me “Is it appropriate to sign this as Donald Duck? I really identify as a duck now just like all these stupid millennials. Did you know that they made up a bunch more genders? Some of them even think they are both! If they can have both parts then surely I can be a duck-“ 

I cut him off. I snatch away his unsigned receipt. I have had enough. 

In my rudest tone of voice I loudly tell him 
“That will be all sir we can do without your signature. Now please, see yourself out or I will have you escorted out for your behavior. This behavior is not appropriate, you are preventing other customers from paying and causing a scene. 

This is the very limit of my professionalism and I am honestly shocked/proud of myself for not fucking screaming at this old pervy homophobic trash can in front of everyone. If he had said one more word I would’ve lost my shit. 

Dave looked shocked and his face turned red and he walked out of the building. I haven’t seen him back at the restaurant since, I think he was embarrassed enough not to come back. 

Also, he hardly ever tips the waitress/waiter. Please, if you are like Dave, stay far _*far*_ away from me in hell where you belong. 

TL;DR: 
Old guy Dave comes into place I work at, never tips, n’ makes inappropriate jokes to the staff. One day after making disgusting jokes and holding up a huge line for 10 minutes with a stupid facebook thing and homophobic comments about millennials and gender. I yell at the guy and he left embarrassed/hasn’t come back. 

Could I have been nicer to Dave to get him to leave? Maybe. But honestly, I wish I could’ve been meaner because man do I really struggle with him as a customer.No, I don’t want to see your crusty facebook memes while you’re holding up the line to pay. Also, fuck homophobes.",TalesFromYourServer
"We're a new resturaunt, opened last Tuesday.  Tonight was busy,  I got slammed with 5 tables all at once &amp; 3 of them had joiners who came later than everyone else.  I even had to skip a turn because I couldn't get caught up. One of these tables arrive &amp; set thier infant on top of the table like a centerpiece.  Of course the baby knocks all the waters over so I'm cleaning up spills &amp; getting refills.  I think they were all sharing the 2 pops they ordered too because they were always empty &amp; like immediately after getting them.
They'd said 2 more people were joining them but only 1 more showed up.  And I recognize her, I've Served her before at my other job, she always shows up late acts like a needy pretentious bitch then doesn't tip.  
So I take thier orders &amp; they won't order in order, just keep jumping around the table so that's getting annoying as I'm trying to write things down in order.  Then one grown ass man won't order for himself, his buddy orders then says he'll have the same thing.  
Me- ok.
Another woman at table- ""with 1000 Island dressing""
Me- yes
Woman- ""1000 Island""
Me- yes, same as this guy here, I have it marked down
Woman ""1000 ISLAND! 1000 ISLAND""
 Like seriously she said it like 6 times!  I'm not fucking stupid!
Then everyone whose already ordered &amp; said loaded baked potatoes start tweaking thier toppings so I'm going back &amp; adding notes.
Then 1000 Island lady orders chicken.  The other 4 had steaks.  I ring everything up &amp; a few mins later I thought I saw things starting to get plated &amp; I take a look at everything &amp; I had missed ringing in the steak for the guy who couldn't speak for himself.  So I do that &amp; I tell our trainer it goes with the rest but I guess the didn't understand &amp; thought that table only had 1 meal.  Not sure how they thought I accidently rang in 4 other meals???
And want to know who takes this steak that goes out?  1000 Island psychopath who ordered chicken.  At this point I'm fucking done, I don't care anymore because now I know when the other meals do come out someone is going to complain they didn't get thier meal because she just ate it.  
She complains about where the other meals are, I said there was a miscommunication &amp; they'd be out soon.  And they were, kitchen was walking out with them as I saw them get up &amp; walk out.

"I know it’s been discussed a little here but how are different restaurants dealing with Coronavirus?  What precautions are you taking?  

We stopped using metal silverware and dine in cups, it’s all single use to-go only.  We took condiments and chopsticks from our drink station and they’re all given out per request and condiments/lemons are pre-portioned.  

We’re supposed to wash our hands at least every 30 minutes or any time we change tasks and use hand sanitizer after washing (nurse friends have told me this is unnecessary) and send something to our boss’s boss twice a day verifying that no one is showing symptoms.

This team is a very tight-knit family, and this one woman, Maria, kinda took me under her wing, made me feel a part of the team. And she lead the coalition that pressured my boss into making me a waiter. She's sort of my work-mama.

"Not a terribly enraging story, more weird and baffling.  At my restaurant we serve our salads on chilled plates to help them stay crisp and keep them from getting gross and wilted.

"After 18 years in the serving and bar-tending industry I can safely say that this is a piece of advise formed over many sour faces, cruddy reviews, and incoherent complaints. 

To start off, if you've never been to a restaurant, visiting it for the first time during a major holiday will never give you an accurate representation of the quality of food, staff or atmosphere. From low-level corporate options (hey, tons of careers start in an Applebee's, don't knock it) to the highest end (a fine dining independent originally built in the late 1700's, with one of the most extensive wine cellars on this coast) this rule holds true. 

1) You will encounter a dining room rearranged to press as many guests into it as possible vs. create any nuance of comfortable atmosphere. On high traffic days, restaurants tend to add additional tables in order to take advantage of the additional business. The fact that your comfort and enjoyment aren't put to the forefront as a guest on these few days should be an automatic red flag.

2) Secondly, on many occasions, the menu you will receive will be drastically reduced and modified to exit the kitchen as quickly and as easily as possible in order for you to eat and be on your way. Many restaurants spend days ahead of time prepping for this day and it lowers the chance of truly fresh ingredients on these days as opposed to days that are in regular prep planning rotation. Simply put, you aren't going to get a fair estimation of the food or the menu.

3) Most notably the service is going to be a letdown. By design, it is going to be an incredibly busy day and the service staff has been drilled to turn tables as fast as possible and to take as many guests as they can. This comes into contrast with the majority of business days in these same restaurants where staff is encouraged to develop relationships with their guests. Holidays are filled with overworked staff, usually on little to no break, with their managers telling them to work faster. 

4) Finally the clientele on these days is completely different than on average days at a restaurant. Restaurant staff are familiar with what I call the ""Holiday Upgrade"" mentality of guests. For instance. People accustomed to going to a 2 star casual dining chain restaurant as their weekly night out, will decide to upgrade for something special on the holidays and visit a 3 star casual independent restaurant . Those who frequent the 3 star will travel to a destination 4 star fine dining establishment, etc. This means that the clientele you see on a holiday is actually, on average going to be a step down from normal clientele. This is also a problem for the service staff because the restaurant is filled with people very unaccustomed to the restaurant's practices and serving standards. This tends to cause a lot to be sent back, thus slowing the kitchen even more. 

If you're looking to get a good idea of just how good or bad a restaurant that's new to you can be, I'd highly recommend stopping in (in general) on a slow weekday evening. Don't feel embarrassed to ask staff to tell you about the restaurant, it's food, and what they like about it. These are times when staff wants to meet you, and will go out of their way to impress you, as the pressure is off, and they have the opportunity to do their best for you. This will lead to a much lower chance of disappointment.Don't visit a restaurant for the first time on a holiday. You will always leave disappointed.",TalesFromYourServer

He looked really surprised and confused and said “oh are you sure? I hate when I get that stuff on me I’d never do it on purpose!” I obviously didn’t take offence to it or anything but it was SO WEIRD. 

I wasn’t wearing eyeshadow or bronzer or anything so he was surely referring to my highlight which is aggressively sparkly and I do get comments on it often just not like this lmao. It reminded me of a couple weeks ago when a woman asked me if I had food in my teeth and I said no my tooth is chipped and she asked me why I hadn’t gone to the dentist. PEOPLE ARE SO WEIRD why are they so concerned about my face damn. That one honestly made me self conscious though and later that night an old man kept telling me to smile lol.A customer asked me what happened to my face",TalesFromYourServer
"Real strange one happened to me today. One of the stranger things in my 9 years in the industry. 

Very odd but nice regular comes in with 3 friends, we chat a lot, they order, have a fab time and pay. As they’re finishing their wine and I’m by my til the regular comes up to me (out of sight from his guests), slips me £10 and asks to pay for one more bottle of wine discreetly, and have me come to the table and tell everyone it’s on the house as he’s one of our favourite guests. 

I figured I’d do it as it’s no harm to me. So here I am explaining to the table that I had had a conversation with my manager and we’d agreed to offer them a free bottle of wine to show our appreciation. 

As I’m pouring the wine the regular comes back from the loo, and looks at me bewildered; “we didn’t order another bottle of wine”, I then turn to him and repeat to him how much of a fantastic guest he is and we wanted to do something special. He looked at me with genuine appreciation and gave me a hug. 

Such a nice, but strange man.It’s on the house!",TalesFromYourServer
"Mostly just posting this to blow off steam, sorry if posts from the other side of the counter aren’t meant here, I’ll delete if so.

There’s a bar that I go to semi regularly in town, and recently there’s a really cute bartender that’s started working there on weekends. I have a pretty specific type, and it seems like she’s it.

I don’t want to impose myself on her, because I know servers are earning their tips and that they’re not specifically flirting with you and don’t want people being pushy with them at work. I don’t want to impose any of that on to her. I don’t want to *flirt* with her per se, I’d really just like to chat with her when I’m there sometimes and if it seems like she’s cool with me, maybe ask her if she’d like to hang out sometime. I don’t know how she’d feel about that or how the average bartender would feel about that though.

It really sucks, because I have PTSD which makes it really hard for me to connect with people or be attracted to anyone. It’s been years since I’ve met anyone at all that I would even remotely be interested in talking to or dating or anything, and of course when it finally does happen it’s a service worker.Bartenders, is there any way for a customer who might be interested in you to tastefully get to know you somehow?",TalesFromYourServer

"This actually happened the other night during Fur Rondy here in Anchorage and it happened to another server where I work.

Guest: ""Excuse me. This tastes too much like chicken.""

Server: ""Its chicken Dijon ma'am.""

Guest: ""Just take it away.""

"I recently started working at a chain restaurant that prides itself on being a sports bar. We push surveys all the time and recently got a complaint saying ""I dont drink and the restaurant smelled like beer, I will not be coming back""... it's a sports bar what did you expect, please do not come back.What did they expect?",TalesFromYourServer
"To start off, the restaurant I work at is located in a small strip mall with some outside seating areas and public wifi set by the city. There are many strip malls where I live that are like this and are very cookie-cutter; during the winter time the city will install heaters so that people sitting outside can still be warm. Again these are the property of the city and not of any restaurants or other businesses located in the strip mall. 

We also had rain earlier today. 

One of my coworkers just told me that he got yelled at by some old fart passing by outside because, according to what my coworker quoted him as saying, ""you guys shouldn't be having the heaters on when there's no one sitting out here"" and when my coworker said that he can't do anything about the heaters outside because we're not responsible for them, the old man flipped him off. 🙄

(btw I got cut early because it was super slow and I wrote this after I got cut. I did not write this during work)we literally can't do anything about the heaters outside our restaurant you decrepit old man because THEY DON'T BELONG TO US",TalesFromYourServer
"Years ago, my first restaurant job back out of the military was at Longhorn.

Great job, it hadn’t been bought by Darden yet, so...that long ago.

Its a Friday night, we are working a 2 hour wait, the restaurant is full. (Which means the  grill is full etc).

I walk up to the booth I just got sat, a nice enough couple on a date.  They had waited 90 minutes to be sat.

As I’m schpieling, the gentleman interrupts me to tell me “I am deathly allergic to garlic, and onion and it cannot be anywhere near my plate.”

I go confused,  offer to get a manager since this is beyond my wheelhouse.

Go down to the line tell the GM and have to pull him off Expo. He goes “Ill talk to him”

I was off to the side.

GM goes. “Sir, I was told you are deathly allergic to garlic and onion?”

Guy on date: “Yeah, I can’t have it anywhere near my food.”

GM: “Well, I need to ask you to leave then as we cannot accomadate you, those spices are in everything we have except deserts, and I cannot guarantee the deserts haven’t had some contamination with the spices in the air. I’m really sorry but I have no food that is safe for you.”

Guy on date stammers and changes his story.

GM: “Sir you told me and my server you were deathly allergic, as in death, I’m sorry but please leave, we won’t serve you,”

and that’s how we rolled.

&amp;#x200B;

edited to add-

1-we later assumed he didn’t want bad breath on the date...carry a mint player!

2-It gets even better, to have even tried to accommodate him, we would have had to finish cooking the orders still on the grill, then clean the grill, then cook his food, then after it was out of the window now do the entire restaurants back logged orders that would crash the kitchen.

and we still couldn’t guarantee no contamination.When They say they have an allergy, GM goes all in.",TalesFromYourServer
"customer PSA: If your server has tattoos, don’t you ever DARE grab their arm to look at them. 

I have been a server with tattoos for four years now, and it never fails that once every couple of months someone will grab my arm, my wrist, and start asking questions about my tattoos 

no, my fucking GRIM REAPER tattoo doesn’t mean anything. fuck off“oh, do you tattoos mean anything?”",TalesFromYourServer
"Just a rant but I definitely feel bad about this somewhat, I could have been more mature but it just started off kind of bad today. At the start of my shift I had already gotten in trouble two times because I forgot to take my temperature before I started my shift thanks to corona virus and went through the wrong door. 

Anyways I snapped at a table today. I was giving coffee to a 4 top of older folks 2 were waving there menus up in the air and one was holding his coffee up in the air yelling “YO!!” They barely were sitting for less than a minute. Then one of the ladies started going off on me saying 

“wow you guys don’t wear gloves anymore when serving coffee. You guys really don’t care about your job and are so lazy we’re going to get sick because of you” 

I just walked away and put on gloves because I forgot since the new corporate policy is that we’re required to wear gloves at all times except when taking orders and every time we take an order or touch anything other than more than one plate we have to wash our hands. 

And at the same table I forgot to bring one of the ladies her drink and this guy starts going off on me too telling me 

“I can’t believe you forgot to take her drinks! She doesn’t matter at all to you gals! Just because we’re old we don’t matter at all to you! You don’t care about us! This is such horrible service!!” And slowly just got louder and louder almost yelling at me. 

So being upset I grabbed her drinks put it on table and was like “Look! She has her drinks! I’m very busy and I’m sorry I forgot but look right here she has her drinks! Can you see it!?” And I gave the table up to another server after that. But then he tried telling the other server he was “just joking”.Snapped finally and my shift barely started",TalesFromYourServer
"Not 15 years to the day you understand, that would be far too poetic and magical, but 15 years 'roughly'. I started working in a Chinese buffet place when I was 16, running dishes and scrubbing pots. I saw two grown women fight over a double-booked table, it came to blows, one pushed the other over, fried shrimp and cheap prosecco took flight, the husbands tried to intervene, they were unsuccessful. 

And on that day I became a man.

I would jump from services to retail, to hospitality then back to services. Hired, fired, re-hired, fired again, promoted, demoted, burned, scarred and have held ""almost"" every position in a restaurant outside of General Manager, to which I am very grateful for.

After 15 years I've finally bagged a non-services job, my last shift is Friday. Everyone at the place I currently work is sad, my manager is sad, the regular customers are sad, I am pretending to be sad. But the one thing I'll never forget is the stories, the tales of Karens clawing their way up through the pits of hell, at night they fill my dreams asking if the chicken is gluten-free and demanding to speak to the manager. I don't think I'll ever run out of stories, or stop enjoying the look of horror spread over people's faces as I recite them for those who have enjoyed the luxury of never working in our sector. 

So without further creative ramble, here are the top complaints I've received from customers. Organized in a list, in no specific order because that sounded like too much work.  

&amp;#x200B;

1)  ""WHAT' A' 'E'' MEAN ''U CAN' GI'B ME BEER? GIMMIE A DRINK Y'A \*\*\*\*\* OR I'LL HAVE A WORD WI' YO'R MANAGER AND GIT Y' FIRED\*smug look\*"" 

Context: Fast food restaurant thought it was a good idea to serve beer. We were open 24/7 and stopped serving beer at 10pm, every weekend (or around any major sporting event) as the bars closed and the drunk zombies stumbled home they passed our sign, beaming like a lighthouse in an otherwise empty and dark street, a small tiny part of their brain we call ""the Nugget center"" would light up and a voice would start screaming ""Nuggets!"" in their ear. They stumble in through the front door, see the massive POS advert for our new branded beer and immediately come to the conclusion they could continue drinking here.

This was particularly bad when large groups of track suit wearing sluggers would swarm the place trying to convince me to keep serving them often with the wonderful phrase ""Show me the rule where it says I can't drink here?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

2) My Sushi is Cold!

Context: or ""My fish is Raw!!"" or ""Where is the meat? Why is it all rice??!"" or ""Why is it so small?"" kind of complaints you get from people who have no idea what sushi is and just want to try it because it's the office trend. Pretty confident anyone who's worked in a sushi place has had to deal with these idiots.

&amp;#x200B;

3) My **DISABLED** child said the food I ordered for my **DISABLED** child was cold, do you know how hard it is for me to have a **DISABLED** child and how disappointed my **DISABLED** child was when my **DISABLED** child ordered your food. Did I mention my child is **DISABLED**? 

Context: Take-out place, not exact words but roughly this was the context of their argument. Their food was cold, their child was disabled. She genuinely shouted the word disabled louder every time she said it, and she said it as every opportunity. She also had no child with her.

The best part? The receipt for her food was dated 7 months prior. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) ""Excuse me, I booked! Why am I not allowed to sit down?""

Context: the building was on fire. No I'm not making that up. A large neon sign had overheated and flames started erupting from it. The restaurant had been evacuated, four fire engines were parked outside, the alarm was still going off and the place was filled with smoke. The fire had been put out by this point and the GM had returned to the building to turn off the alarm while the Fire dept examined the sign. Enter stage left, woman in early 50's, stands by the 'please wait here to be seated sign', FF noticed her, wanders over and tells her the place is 'obviously closed'. She huffs and leaves, walks outside and pulls out her phone. She downloads the Restaurant app, makes a reservation for that day, then walks *back* into the restaurant which is still full of smoke, demands to see the manager and proclaims loudly that she has a reservation and the law requires we serve her.

She was not alone. Over the course of the next few hours, while we were still around, several more people would attempt to walk into the smokey, dark restaurant. A few laughed it off ""Oh guess I need better glasses then, ha ha"" and another demanded to know why we were closed, dragged my GM outside and tried to point to the opening times posted on the door ""See it's not 10pm yet, you *should* be open"".

&amp;#x200B;

5) ""The Ice in my water has watered down my water, I demand a free replacement""

and

6) ""What do you mean Your staff won't go to McDonalds for us? We PAID to be here!""

Context:  explained here [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the\_night\_of\_the\_living\_vegans/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/c9cek4/the_night_of_the_living_vegans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

But for tldr; I'll just say this. Vegan Influencers.

&amp;#x200B;

7) The customer demanded to free replacement on her cappuccino because ""it was too wet""

Context: I mean how do you respond to that? After biting down my tongue to resist the temptation to point out that coffee is a liquid which, historically, has always been wet. I get her to clarify, after a bit of back and forth, and with a lot of tutting, it turns out what she actually wants is a Babyccino, some weird drink made-up by upper-middle-class people to give to children who want to sit in on the ""fun"" of having coffee with Sharon from jazzercise class.

It's all foam, with some chocolate powder sprinkled over the top.

&amp;#x200B;

8)  Guy comes in, orders two cheeseburgers, two coffees, and a cake, hands me $5 and looks genuinely offended that it didn't cover the full cost. 

Context: He wasn't old enough for it to be a generational thing. But the look he gave me when I told him the price made me think he'd misheard me say something rude about his mother. He pulled out a 20, threw it on the counter then yanked his phone out of his pocket and made a show of calling his friend to complain about the over-priced restaurant he was in.

&amp;#x200B;

9) How to order a coffee in &lt;popular student cafe&gt;:

1) Wander aimlessly around the store for 10 minutes  
2) Stare at the menu for a further 10 minutes ignoring the man behind the till asking if you need assistance.  
3) Wait till the vendor starts serving someone else then glare at them.  
4) Order a coffee that wasn't on the menu, ask for it to be topped off with Yoghurt and crushed Almonds  
5) Stare in disbelief at the menu for another 10 minutes when informed the cafe cannot fulfill your request.  
6) Order a cappuccino  
7) Leave the counter and await coffee by standing in the middle of the shop with your arms folded.  
8) Wait till Vendor has prepared coffee, brought it to you and started to walk away.  
9) Ask for extra sugar, wait till vendor returns with sugar.  
10) demand a Take-out cup.  
11) Leave requested additional sugar on the table as you walk out. 

Also includes this wonderful transaction at the same location:

Them: Tea Please  
Me: how do you like it?  
Them: medium, please  
Me:...OK, sugar?  
Them: Yes  
Me: how many?  
Them: with milk, please.  
Me: alright so no sugar?  
Them: uhhh.....just medium, please. 

Speaking of which I really wish people waiting in line wouldn't jangle change and stare at me while I'm serving someone, what are they expecting me to drop everything I'm doing and run over to them and say ""Oh I'm sorry sir I wasn't aware you had MONEY how foolish of me to serve that other person first just because they came in and ordered before you, how cass of me I do apologize"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway

10) ""How can it possibly take you longer than 5 minutes to cook a full meal? \*I\* can do it at home in less time!""

Context: They had a lecture at 10am (and made sure I was well aware of that), came in around 9:40, sat down ordered coffee, then and 9:50am asked for two full breakfast meals sit-in.  
I explained that it would take at least 10 mins to cook both breakfasts and the extra coffee and they wouldn't have enough time to get to the lecture hall at 10 but they ordered regardless, paid then 5 mins later complained I was being too slow and ""now had to run"". 

They came back later and demanded a full explanation as to how it was not possible to cook a full breakfast meal in under 5 minutes, line by line with 'exact' cooking times specified.

&amp;#x200B;

11) \*In an attempt to prize open the door\* ""You're still in there, I can see you! that means you're open! Stop trying to be lazy and serve me!"" 

Or words to that effect, this was so long ago I can't honestly remember what he said, I only remember that boiled ham face with its weird cheesy grin as he attempted to destroy me with Facts and Logic. 

Now I've seen enough stories on this subreddit to know I am not alone when it comes to customers trying to force their way into empty, closed restaurants so I won't bore you with the details only that our door was on a motor, you turn the little key and the shutter comes down. 

While closing one night two hands appear under the shutter just before it hits the ground and an effort is made to push the shutter back up. Thinking this might be an emergency or something I raise the shutter only to be confronted by a man who rushes the door, glares at me and starts pounding on the glass demanding to be let in because he'd 'caught' us trying to close early.

We'd closed on time, some half-hour ago, pulling the shutter down was the last thing we did at night.

&amp;#x200B;

12) ""What do you mean you will not honor this deal made by the previous business?""

Context: The restaurant sat on property previously owned by a large chain restaurant. That restaurant had closed down nearly 12 years ago after moving to a different part of town, yet people still came waddling in with vouchers and coupons for that company expecting us, a very clearly different restaurant, to honor them. Some arguments got very heated and if I could tell you the name of that restaurant you could go look at the *hundreds* of 1-star yelp reviews complaining that we don't honor other restaurants coupon deals.   

&amp;#x200B;

and finally

&amp;#x200B;

13) ""What do you mean you're open Sunday? That is the LORDS day""

Yes, this did happen. We received a very long, yet very polite letter from a local priest questioning our decision to open Sundays and requesting we close that day in order to give the staff time to rest and pray as our Lord (in one religion) did when he created the world and threatened to preach to his pulpit to people not to come to the restaurant on Sundays. He also questioned a lot of other things that I won't mention in polite company but let's just say if you dyed your hair blue you were getting nasty looks from Agnus and the Sunday Squad.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's all I can think of for now.

Go away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and remember if you do go into a stylish Asian restaurant, don't order the duck pancakes.After 15 years this Friday is my last shift in the Services Industry: So here's a list of all my favorite customer complaints.",TalesFromYourServer
"Not a story, so to speak, but I’ll explain. Whenever we hit our rush and everyone is moving, I feel like my head is a radio playing songs but the dial is constantly turning. I’ll be singing songs in my head or to myself and they’ll change depending on a sound I hear, someone talking, yelling, sometimes even smells or turning a corner can trigger songs. Anyone else like this during their rush or is it just me?Is anyone else’s head a radio?",TalesFromYourServer
Fuck no! Someday I'll say it.Can you take our picture?,TalesFromYourServer
"I’m not sure if this belong here but I don’t care I need to vent. I got told that I couldn’t go around saying words like that, tampon is a very inappropriate word, and he doesn’t go around taking about his male functions (which are what exactly??) happy international woman’s day!My manager yelled at me for asking if I could get a tampon from my car",TalesFromYourServer
"I work 12 hour shifts at a 'high end' sandwich place which also serves fresh juices and smoothies. This tale just happened and I'm kinda still dumbfounded. 

A little back story- I fell on my leg and hurt it pretty badly last week. The pain felt unbearable on this day. I couldn't find anyone to take my shift so I just had to keep working.

This is the 9th hour of my workday and I was at the cashier when these two Ladies walk in and order with the numbers listed on the menu instead of the names. I take their order normally and went to help my coworkers. Their food is served and after a few moments they come by and say, they got the wrong drinks. They ordered smoothies, not juices. And I realised because of my preoccupation with pain I forgot to ask them if they wanted the juice or smoothie. 

Okay fair enough. I apologise and explain to them what happened and ask my coworker to make them the right order, no charge, and I go back to work. My other coworker asked me what happened and I also explain the mistake to her.

After their correct order was done the lady just all of a sudden bursted out like a chest monster- 'This is not the right way to treat customers', 'I come here everyday and this is not the right color of the drink' and 'I work in the service industry too and I would never treat my paying customers like this.'

At this point the whole restaurant is looking at this yelling lady. I limp over to see what's happening and she unleashes another word vomit cloud on me. As we keep asking what's the problem and how we can fix it she just keeps shouting at the top of her lungs 'you can't treat customers like this'. So to finish this I apologise to her again and go back to work.

She storms off and a minute later the other lady walks in and starts talking to the shift manager. Apparently when I explained to them my mistake I was talking very 'rudely'. And then I turned around and 'talked shit' about them to my coworker. And apparently my other coworker made their drinks wrong to spite them for some reason.

I'm sorry lady that you're so unhappy in life that you have to yell at service people because they didn't behave like sunshine is coming out of your ass. I'm still super confused as to what triggered this person so much. This place gets busy and we make hundreds of orders per day. Mistakes are bound to happen from both sides. But we always correct them. Literally no one has ever acted like this. 

tl.dr.- Customer gets upset and yells at me because I was 'rude' to her when explaining a mistake I made.You made the wrong drink just to spite me!",TalesFromYourServer
more of a question but do they do this? sorry if i poorly wordeddo servers be relaxed and not charge for every little thing if a customer is exceptionally nice? or charge for every little thing if mean?,TalesFromYourServer
"Well at least she thought so

On mobile as always

So my latest story from my angry customer phone calls in carside 

Phone rings and I answer it as it always seems when someone is calling to validate their existence. 

Anyway, I’m not going to go through the convo but just give a recap

Lady says she wants to place an order but wanted to say that last time she got a delivery she “couldn’t” leave us a review because she wasn’t given enough of the free bread. Ok, whatever, it’s some frozen shit bread that people think is fresh made. Anyway, then she goes on to say that her to go portions last time weren’t as large as their dine in portions. Well now I know she’s bat shit crazy, because everything is portioned out by weight so yeah. 

I listen to her ramble on for a few minutes before telling her I can let her speak to a manger because I can’t do shit about portion sizes and tell her that if she wants extra bread all she has to do is ask for it. She just keeps repeating the same shit over and over and then drops the bomb “I’m an ELITE yelper”. Lol. I put her on hold to get a manager and our managers are very familiar with this lady so they just kept her on hold until she hung up since she’s always just looking for free shit. 

That’s all, lady thought she was hot shit since she was an elite yelper, no one gives a fuck.I finally met a celebrity!",TalesFromYourServer
"EDIT/UPDATE: They actually emailed my GM specifically to commend me! My GM encouraged them to make the post!

I’ve been serving for about 7 months now at a really busy brunch place in South Florida, and I’d definitely underestimated just how stressful and laborious it can be! The pace is lightning quick here and there’s a pretty steep learning curve. Couple that with the fact that I’m only doing this to make money on the side as I study for law school full-time, I was really happy to finally be able to *truly* pull my weight a couple months into the job.

Today, my manager sent me a 5-star Yelp review written by a lovely table I’d served yesterday (they were there for a birthday). They said the food was fantastic, but that it was my service that made the experience. Better yet, I didn’t even do anything that I’d consider out-of-the-ordinary for me. How I treated them was how I (try to) treat every table because it’s how I’d hope a server would treat me.

That made it all the more personal, so this made my week!Earned my restaurant a 5-star Yelp review that mentioned me by name!",TalesFromYourServer
"
So there I was on an unassuming Sunday afternoon, mind full of hope and a naive attitude. I was only a smidge hungover from the night before but nothing was going to stop me from getting that bread today. I walked into work dick swinging in the breeze and tossed my jacket on a chair like the fucking Fonz. I decided to walk through the back of house with my sunglasses on so I could stunt of these cooks and server hoes. I relieved the morning bartender with a high five and began to get that sourdough. 

An hour or so into the shift things are going great, I’m working my tables and rocking my bar top like I’m Kanye at friends wedding. Needless to say I’m crushing it. Before I could even polish my pimp cup for my post shift buss down, in walks hell in a bad haircut. This woman looked like Peggy Bundy and Peggy Hill has a sister who was a total asshole. An Omega-level Karen. Like, if Magneto or fuckin Thanos just wanted to go in on a bartender this was the one.  I’m used to dealing wit these hoes so I go in like Drake at a high school prom. 

I wait what I call a required four minutes to go greet her and her dumb looking husband and she says, hey.....my dude....we ready. I’m like bet, this bout to be easy as hell. It wasn’t. 

*a bar ticket prints

Not only was this bitch not ready but she was so lost in the entire idea of people ordering food from a person in a place where people order food from a person. Mind you, I wasn’t super busy at the time but I would end up in so deep in the weeds I’d need a machete to find my way out. The following convo went like this:

*a bar ticket prints

Me: are we ready to order?
Custy: yes. And we are in a rush to get home to our dogs sooooooooo......
Me: no prob. What are we drinking?
C: I’d like a beer what do you have on tap?
Me 😑 standing in front of her while we are both literally 11inches away from the taps listing them all off. 

*a bar ticket prints

C: ya know what I’ll have a martini
M: what sorta vodka would you like?
C: I’d like a blackberry sangria

*a bar ticket prints

At this point two of my tables are giving me the ‘i would like my check’ wave

Me: ok the sangr-
C (while holding the drink menu in her hand) : actually what do you have for bottled beer?

*a bar ticket prints

I list off the beer list. 
The couple two seats down ask for refills 
The couple behind me ask for ketchup
The guy at the end of the bar points at his empty glass

*another fucking bar ticket prints

Me: so what are we thinking?
C: I’ll have a tall bud light
Me: ok. And for the husband?
H: a margarita

*another ticket prints how have we not run out of fucking paper yet!!!!!!!!

C: I’ll also have a margarita
Me: okely dokely you fucking terrorist

This took 6.38 minutes 

So I get their stupid drinks and food in and then I realize I have four checks to drop off and eventually cash out, what feels like 90 tickets and 137 drinks to make in the printer, 5 drinks to make on the bar top, one side of ketchup, two diet cokes I definently have to go out back for because this gun fucking sucks or whatever, this hoe over here needs ranch, dummy at 103 asks to change to some baseball game, I just got sat again and the bud light keg just kicked. Fml 

*another ticket prints

And then she sat there for two hours yelling at her husband and left mediocre tip. The end

So I’ve been working at the same restaurant for the past 3 yrs I have put in about 4-5 vacation forms and they have all been denied due to this I have had missed family trips in April I turn 4 years there and I feel like I deserve vacation time especially since I’ve been working there full time instead of half time (which I Had applied for) due to being understaffed I want to put one in for July and I’m making sure that I put enough months in advanced but I’m scared I might get rejected againVacation denial",TalesFromYourServer
"Last night I worked a 14 top. They were all terrible people, douchiest people I have ever come in contact with. The royal family of Douchland. One guy sits down and orders a beer. He says, “Every time you come to the table I want you to have a beer for me.” I thought he was probably just joking, so I leave and come back and he says, “Where is my beer? Did you really forget what I told you like 2 minutes ago? Wow.” So I said, “OH! I am so sorry it won’t happen again.” So, for the next 2 hours, no matter what. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I approached the table I left a beer. After about
45 minutes the  beer began to pile up. A friend of King Doucherbottom tried to take one that I put down, but I grabbed it and said, “Sorry sir, this is your friends beer I would be happy to get one for you if you like.” Long story short he ended up buying 25 beers at 8 dollars a pop with a 20% mandatory auto-grat on the table. He maybe drank 4. I have never felt so good in my life. It doesn’t pay to be an arrogant ass folks!

EDIT: Man, thanks everyone! This was a crowning achievement in my 7 years of serving. I work at a place where some people come in and treat me like a piece of stew meat, and I have learned to play the game in order to make money. I love my job and the people I meet, but I get stepped on a lot. Its nice to win one and have you guys appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: This is incredibly humbling. I knew it was a good Server Tale, but thank you guys! I don’t post much on anything ever, so this means so much that you guys liked what I did. 

To answer some questions: They split the bill seven ways. They did not even look at the charges. I put down the bill and the cards went on top. Their total bill was about 1200 everything included, beer, food, and all. This not common at a 14 top where I work, but not surprising. I came out making around 240 before tip out. 

I work at an independent fine dining italian restaurant outside of Chicago. 

Every time I put a beer down he said nothing. If he would have acknowledged my presence and told me to stop I would have. He said nothing. I started to feel bad, for a couple minutes,  and then he yelled at me like a dog to get the food out faster.  THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED. I just want to reiterate that. HE ASKED FOR IT. Also, I was watching him drink. If at any point his behavior/ consumption increased I would have stopped. He walked out the exact same way he walked in. Like a doucher. 

The beer was SURROUNDING HIS SEATING AREA. Just bottles and bottles and bottles. It was incredible. 

I make my own drinks where I work, as we don’t have a typical bar, just a large server station. No bar tender was involved.

I cannot deny the illegality of it, but I do not regret it!

The BOH and bussers enjoyed the undisturbed beers. I felt so good bringing them back in a bus tub of ice. It was like seeing the excitement of children on Christmas morning. 

My manager saw the bill and was pissed, but no reports of anything we would be liable for as of yet!Jerk gets exactly what he asked for.",TalesFromYourServer

"A recent story in here reminded me of an asshole I had at one of my very first customer service jobs... 

I was working my first shift as a manager at a very famous sandwich shop that used to have a pedophile as their mascot. That's not an import detail, but I hated that guy from the day his mug showed up on our cups... 

My store was in a tiny little town about an hour south of Pittsburgh. The biggest event of the summer was taking place - the carnival - and it was happening right outside our back door. Our evenings were full of drunk people, annoying kids and bags of forgotten goldfish.

Yet, it was Friday morning when we got our worst customer.

What walked in our door could be described as 'human' but only in the loosest possible terms. He shambled. He didn't make eye contact. He was dirty. He was very clearly still on the drunk side of hungover... he was a traveling carney man.

I don't mean to insult carnies as a whole. My childhood best friend is a carney and one of the hardest working people I've ever met... the guy in my sandwich shop was quite clearly the genesis if the carnie stereotype.

I was standing behind the glass with a co-worker when the carnie stumbled up to the glass and said that he wanted a sub.

""What kind of sub sir?""
""I don't care.""
""Well would you like an Italian or stea...""
""I don't fucking care!!!""

We decided on a steak sub, double meat, double cheese.

""OK sir, how about veggies?""
""What?""
""What veggies would you like on your sub?""
""All of them!""

Lettuce, onions, tomato, black olives, yellow peppers, jalapeños (we carried them), green peppers, cucumbers, pickles...

""What would you like for a dressing?""
""What?!""
""Italian? Mayon...""
""Can't you fuckin hear? Put it all on there!!! Fuck!!!""

Italian, oil &amp; vinegar, mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup (don't ask), salt &amp; pepper, Italian seasoning... oh and (I remembered we had seasonal item sauces in the walk-in) gyro sauce and tartar sauce from lent, the year before.

""For here or to go?""

""Here!""
""That'll be $12.73"" (or whatever a double meat/cheese 11 inch sub costs) 

It was the largest, sloppiest, nastiest sub we had ever created. By the time he got it unwrapped the bread had turned to mush and the fillings slopped out on the wrapper. He proceeded to eat it fistfull by fistfull. 

We watched in horror and awe. 

He finished it, and just as I was starting to feel guilt over being part of ruining this guy's day, he stands up, cleans up his table and thanks us for the best damn sub he has ever had.

I guess the customer is right on on occasion.I want a sub with everything...",TalesFromYourServer
"Two days ago around the beginning of the dinner rush, the hostess was trying to seat a four top in my section. They totally ignored her then went to a table that still had dirty dishes and trash all over it.

Three of them remained standing as we were trying to clear the dishes since they insisted on sitting there. However, one woman I nicknamed **Large Marge** sat her fat behind down then started pushing all of the dishes over to one side and declaring this table “needs to be cleaned.”

The hostess and I got rid of the dishes as quickly as possible. On our way to the kitchen, we lamented on how classless she was behaving. I felt bad for Large Marge's husband. He must be a glutton for punishment or lost a bet. Either way, he put a ring on it and is stuck with her.
 
I then disappeared to go get a wet and a dry towel so I could wipe/dry the table. Lord knows, if Large Marge would have complained about the table being damp, I would have told her: “God gave you a tongue. You know what to do.” In the process of trying to wipe the table, she snatched the dry towel from me then started wiping and trying to clean the dirty sticky spots. The husband told her to let me do my job. Large Marge said she was just trying to help. He said you always get this way. She yelled bullshit. I seriously thought they were going to have a spat in the middle of the dining room.

The rest of their dining experience proved to be just as I expected. Acted like they were the only patrons there. Super picky. Separate checks. To go boxes. A poor excuse for a tip on the table. I hope I never see them again.The self-seaters",TalesFromYourServer
"There are 2 booths beside each other in the middle of my restaurant that are fucking identical. They have the same view of the TV. They have the same arrangement of booths and tables immeadiately around them. They're the same distance from the doors and windows. Ones not randomly under a vent that makes it freezing cold or a speaker that makes it especially loud. They're identical. This is also a seat yourself sort of establishment, and at certain times of day I am the only server or foh employee on the floor,  so sometimes I fall a little behind on bussing/resetting tables. 



Yesterday I had a family walk in just as a rush was nearly cleared up. One booth had some dirty plates on it, the other I had literally just cleaned, so it was visibly damp. The family looks at these two IDENTICAL tables, and naturally chooses to sit at the dirty one covered in plates rather than the literally sparklingly clean one directly to their right. I get over as fast as I can to get the plates off, trying to give them  an abbreviated welcome spiel,  let them know I'll be right back with menus, i just need to quickly clean their table yadayadayada. I come back with a rag and as I am wiping it down the mother thanks me for clearing this table for them, they didnt want to sit at the wet one!

The ""wet"" table? Now bone dry. Her table? Now wetter than the offending one was when she chose this one. She seemed to realize that contradiction and was a little awkward and off balance with me for their whole meal LOL. They were fine to serve though once we got past their poor table choosing skills.A tale of two booths",TalesFromYourServer
"I work at a family owned Italian place. Theres a customer who always orders take out. I wanna say he calls in an order at least once a week. a while back a cook made a small mistake on one of the items and after that this guy would sit down after he was finished paying,open up the takeout boxes and inspect the items before taking off. Anyways in the last couple of months he has ordered,he has stopped inspecting the food and for the first time in the two and a half years ive been there he actually tipped.

"I’ve always felt anxious about the small amount of people working a shift. Sometimes 3 people is fine, sometimes I wish there was more. 

Lately, it’s been me, alone... or with 1 more person. 

Two people have left. We are even more understaffed, and there’s no plans to replace them. 

My problem is that when we are understaffed, I get an acceptable amount of shifts, but I’m alone or struggling. If we have more staff on the rota, I’m lucky to get 2 shifts. 

I just wish they weren’t so frugal and could have a healthy amount of staff members.

"I had a 6 to brunch table today. The 2 grown daughters were vegan and they were celebrating one of their birthdays. My daughter is vegan so I know our menu well. Everyone enjoyed their lunch,  but we have no vegan desserts. I ran over to the gas station next door and bought a small pack of oreos and made her a plate of oreos and oranges. I brought it out at the end of the meal. She teared up. It was such a small thing to give someone a wonderful birthday.Vegan Table",TalesFromYourServer
"I recognized this middle aged couple tonight because I waited on them months ago and the lady seemed so miserable with life. Complained about everything or made comments like she was Debbie Downer from SNL. 

It was painful for her to acknowledge me and order her glass of plain water, no ice. She ordered her sirloin well done, she doesn’t want to see any blood! Food runner takes it out, she cuts into it, sends it back, food runner says she screamed she saw blood. Manager and I are looking at this sad gray piece of meat as he says this. I go apologize while her steak is getting grilled into shoe leather. She says her potato will get cold while she waits. I assure her we’ll send out a new potato with her steak. Meanwhile her husband is just quietly grubbing down. Manager takes out her rubber steak, all good. 

She now says her husband is finished and she just can’t eat if he’s already done, bring a to go box and the check. I did that too fast. I dropped the check before my manager comped her steak. I take the new check with discounts, and she starts crying. Then proceeds to tell me how her husband is always gone for work and they only get to eat out 8 or 9 times a month together. No place has gotten her order right in months. It’s not my fault, she knows logically I wasn’t back there cooking. I repeated her order back, but now I must think she’s crazy. She’s not crazy! I must know she’s not crazy! She just wants to have a nice meal out with her husband! 

On rare occasions, a customer might get to me. But I wasn’t upset or angry, just kinda dumbstruck. Some people have way more problems than their meal tonight. Save your “only 8-9 meals out” money for therapy. Spare the rest of us.

"Hi all, I'm new to this sub but I've been waiting/bartending on and off (mostly on) for almost 30 years.  

I believe I have achieved burn out.

I can't stand it anymore.  I'm making stupid mistakes when I'm ringing in orders, and I know I'm better than that.  I think my brain is like ""cut this shit out!""  And it's not customers, most of them are just fine.  It's not my managers or my co-workers or the place I work.  I've worked with enough good and bad managers and co-workers that most of what happens I don't even notice anymore.  I've worked in enough good and bad places to know that where I work now is okay. It's not them, it's me.

I recently got a second job hosting part-time at a place down the street.  Why don't I just take more serving shifts?  Because I can't bring myself to do it. So I told my training manager at my present job that I had gotten a second job hosting, and that I might need to tweak my schedule just a little.  He was cool about it, but was like, you know we need hosts here, right?  No, I didn't know that. So he told me I could host 10-15 hours a week there, and serve three days a week if I want.  At my new second job, I could get more hours with that, plus tips on top of my wage.

Here's my idea:  keep both hosting jobs, and have my manager take me off serving completely.  

I know I'd have to work more both places, possibly 40-50 between the two, but...I kind of see this as my way out of serving, without having to job-hop and hit that weird spot with a new job where you don't have any money coming in for 2 to 3 weeks.

I'm almost afraid to bring this idea up to management, but I think now would be the time to do it, as they have hired a few more servers for the upcoming season, including hosts that they are also training to serve. 

Thanks for letting me vent.  Anybody else in a similar situation or tried something like it?Burnt the fuck Out",TalesFromYourServer
"I will try my absolute best to describe what happened with this three top, please bear with me.

When I was about to say my greet, they immediately cut me off and ask, ""I've never been here before, what's good?"" I recommended one dish then suddenly all three of them started to flood me with questions at the same time about everything on the menu. ""How is this? How's that? Hows it cooked? We'll get this, that, this that."" I didn't mind helping them, but I haven't even gotten their drinks yet! I was so lucky I did not have any other tables during this entire encounter. I'm looking at my notepad and it was filled and they were still going.

I pointed out our most popular beef dish and they go, ""nononono, we are vegans. STRICTLY VEGAN. Yes STRICTLYYYYYYYY VEGAN"" Shit. We literally only have two apps and 1 dish that are vegan (steamed shit) and everything I wrote down was not vegan because our sauces contain oyster sauce, chicken broth, etc. I told them this and they gave me the dirtiest look and attitude ""What?? Haha what are we even supposed to eat?! \*hand gestures at the menu\* you cant make any of these dishes vegan? You can't just make it without sauce?""

They also did not like tofu. I double checked with two managers about any other vegan options and they said exactly what I said. There I was, standing for what feels like an eternity telling them the same thing over and over while they try to mod literally EVERYTHING on the menu and getting mad at me because they didn't want the three things I told them. I wasn't getting anywhere so I sent out my manager and she stood there also for what felt like an eternity trying to handle the situation. She came back defeated, I was defeated, she put in their order, yada yada. 

20 minutes later, a girl from the table goes ""I want the sushi roll, yeah I know it has raw fish, that's okay.""

"TW for what seems to be alcoholism



Definitely one of those days I'm gonna look back on as just being disappointed with humanity, but yeah. I worked the entire day, was going into the tenth hour of my shift, when I got sat with this table. They were already an issue in the lobby, when the mom screamed at her child for touching her dress, and the dad threw a fit over a ten minute wait bc he ""had children to feed"". 

Couldn't give them our starting appetizer bc they hadn't put in their entree orders, and later when they complained about me that turned into me ""pre-judging them by their appearance"". 

One child's meal came out five minutes after the rest. I assured them that I had put a 911 on it, it was on its way, I was so sorry abt that. That turned into me being ""dismissive and having a poor attitude"". 

Reminded the mother of a check that she got after the regular meal, one for three desserts that she never had any intention to pay for. She cut me off, refused to look at me and threw her hand up, telling me she would get to it. I said ""Okay. Sorry."" Backed off. That turned into me being ""in her ear"". (I was a foot away, but at this point she was too far gone to care). 

They complained that I was ""mean-mugging"" them while they complained. I wasn't ever looking at them- the closest I got was existing nearby for a couple moments, but I very firmly did not want to look at them. Honestly, I can't say the same for every other server there- it was me looking away and five of my coworkers just staring them down. I assume they were too drunk to care that it wasn't me. 


All throughout this, I kept wondering why they were getting worse when I kept going back. The dad  only had two drinks, and a ton of pasta. The mom was drinking tea. Couldn't figure out why they were getting so aggressive and loud about how much they didn't like me when I was getting everything I could for them. Found out later from the hosts that the mom had been wandering outside a couple times while they were there to drink out of a flask. 

They wrote me a letter basically telling me I wasnt charming or smiling enough while they berated me and made fun of me to all of my coworkers, and that I wasn't going to get the $100 bill they brought in for me (???). Claimed to be servers,  but a lot of how they acted about things like wait time or appetizers implies otherwise.

For instance, some tables would order 1 thing then say, “we need more time can you start out with that?” Then they receive the food, and then I ask them what else they would like. And they say”can we wait until we finish this first?” Like -.- bruh. R u serious. It takes the kitchen TIME hun. Okay. Fine. So they finish and I ask them if they’re ready to order. They order a few more dishes this time. These are still appetizers btw. So Im having to put in multiple tickets for these kinds of tables. The point of me approaching in advance is so that they don’t wait too long after each dish. Because sometIMES I see people getting a little annoyed at how long its taking. And in my head I’m like. Well if you ordered everything at once, the timing would be mUCH better. 
I understand that people are hungry and want to order 1 of the appetizers first, but like its annoying when it’s a talkative table and I haven’t put in much orders yet and the kitchen is mad at me wondering where the ticket for their entrees are at. OR when it’s getting close to closing time and they say they still need to look at the menu (bc Theyre busy chatting)

"I work at a hibachi restaurant and people like to bring their families in for the fun. Almost every Friday and Saturday night, without a doubt, someone will bring in a baby or infant and the initial fire on the grill scares the shit out of them. The chefs do their best to accommodate young children and try not to scare them, but there are other people sat around the grill who are paying for a show. I overheard the chef ask one customer ""are we okay with fire?"" and the parents go ""I don't know. Guess we'll find out."" Low and behold, we're not okay with fire and now we have a loudly crying baby to placate. I even had one guest ask that we just not do fire at all and my manager talked to them and said no, other people are sat around the grill and if they want a fire, we're going to have a fire.

I guess I just don't understand why it's so hard to just remove yourself and your baby from the grill for the 30 seconds or so that there is fire so everyone-including the baby-can have a good time.

I look at the table set for 10 but only 5 a child and a baby are seated before me? Apparently they told the host there were 8 so they could get more room to themselves. 

So start off with drinks aside from the bar being backed up everything goes well. Then they start to order. Dad knows what he wants right away and I like him he’s a chill mother fucker. And it’s so nice he wants to pay for everyone. 

I get to the son (adult son) who has a medical condition so we try to find what he can eat within his means. Finally get to the daughters (also adults one with a baby). Firstly they’re throwing Cheerios at the baby making this huge mess. Secondly one had a really bad dye job with her hair and trust me, that’s a huge red flag in my area for how people will treat you.

“Sorry I was trying to help him find something he can eat”

Man stays quiet.

“Well I have questions” okay get through all that bring out their appetizers “we want more chips!” Literally as Im putting the plate of chips and dip on the table. Okay? Sure it’s not that busy and it’s not like the kitchen will know. 

I go check on my other tables because somehow I end up with seven other tables on top of this “party.” I come back and immediately the girl with the bad dye job “drinks!” Her little girl looks at mom and says “please” thank you little girl teach those manners. 

Come back with my hands full of drinks “where are the chips!?”

“I’m sorry there were no more trays so I was going to bring these and come straight back”

Food comes out and there’s a ton of problems. “This is cold!” Manger stuck his finger in it, it wasn’t we made a new order. “My steak is rare” dye job complains, it says on the menu it comes rare unless otherwise specified, she did not specify. “There’s tomatoes on my food!” They’re peppers they’re very obviously peppers...

“I think they’re peppers” 

“They’re tomatoes take it back!”

I take it back the cook tells me they’re peppers I tell the manager about the idiot girls. I go back and tell them I’m about to have a manager come up and girls get excited “oh good! That’s great news!” Their dad on the other hand sits there like wtf? 

As I’m leaving he tells them to “leave that poor server alone” god bless him... for now. 

Manger takes care of everything I come to do a follow up “where’s the chips!” GOD WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO AND FUCKING CHIPS! I nod say I wasn’t told anything about chips but I’ll get them out right now. Come back with the chips ask about dessert thank god they’re full aside from the goddamn chips. Bring some boxes and the check. Dad pays in cash I give him his change he counts out a tip and leaves it on the table.

I usually wait until the table leaves because it’s rude just to grab it, unless of course they hand it to me. I should have grabbed it because when they were leaving I was looking around the table for the tip and it was gone. Dye job and the sister were laughing and still in hearing range “she’s looking for a tip” I’m pretty sure they took it...

I just about started crying and went to go check on my tables. I did have a couple tears run down at one table and I made those poor people feel so awkward but they couldn’t stand that party of white trash either.

"This is starting to ware me down a bit.  I suppose I’m here to rant and seek support, I’m a 22 y/o waitress. About every third shift I get somebody who makes a comment or multiple comments about my weight. I am healthy but I’ve been awkwardly thin all my life (genetic and anxiety related) and for some reason it seems to be an appropriate topic for so many customers to bring up. It’s usually as a sort of weird joke as if I’m supposedly laugh along like “I should buy you a meal because I think you should eat more” followed by “do you have a boyfriend” (I respond no) “oh well maybe that’s why (looks me up and down. or after making a recommendation“oh but you don’t eat this do you, look at you” (but with a dirty look) “does she eat??” I’ve burst into tears a few times because I feel so self conscious. My boss laughs my concern off as though it’s not serious whatsoever and my co workers tell my not to say anything back to customers to defend myself. I work so hard and I just don’t think being judged on my body is part of my job description. I like my work because being a hard worker is the way I keep a level of self esteem that stops me from feeling depressed, so it’s hard coming to work and having my insecurities brought to light and then just putting up with it every day.

The two regulars bring YA to our place, quietly chatting and complimenting us. YA acted like he had something to prove to the entire restaurant so of course not only does he get our biggest drink order, he gets two. 

Two hours go by and they've all lost their budget on the slot machines so they just sit and chat while sipping. YA had to beg his friends to help him drink and even then they still had about half a bowl left.

At this point, YA asks for a container to take his drink to go. Now I know some other local places allow this but we're not licensed to do takeouts nor will we ever take that risk. We politely decline and tell him that we don't mind him taking his time to finish his drink.

YA gets belligerent. Launches into a spiel about how he's owed a certain service and that he paid good money on slots so he should be given a container. We still refuse because at this point he's slurring his words and that's already a red flag. 

I turn my back and this guy had the audacity to sneak into our employee work area and take one of our empty tip jars and pour his drink in there after dumping the coins out onto the floor.

At this point we're tired of him and firmly tell him and his friends to leave. The two regulars look non-plussed like this is normal and pay for their share and leave. YA is still holding our tip jar full of cocktail and we're not letting him leave with it. He decides this means he doesn't have to pay this bill and when we threaten to call the cops, he throws the container at my manager. 

At this point my coworker reacts and puts him on the ground in an arm bar. He's crying and screaming the whole time it takes the cops to arrive and take him off our hands. 

We haven't seen him or the two regulars since.Had to call the cops",TalesFromYourServer
"So let me reiterate, your server isn’t allowed to call out sick unless it’s puking or diarrhea. Coughing all over your food is totally okay. 

So if you go out to eat and you’re sick, guess what. You’re spreading germs. How? Well you’re talking coughing on the table the plates the condiments, you’re wiping your mouth and nose on napkins and tissues that you inevitably leave for your server to pick up later (guys at least put them on the plates), you’re using silverware that is going to have to be cleaned up. There’s so many ways you’re spreading germs. And then the server has to clean up after you. Now they have contracted those germs. 

Well the server is sick now and if they call out they’re in trouble and could lose their job so guess what, they’re not going to call out now they’re coughing all over your food and all over the kitchen not only spreading germs to the customers it to the coworkers too. Now you have a si k cook making your food. 

Going out to eat is the fastest way to spread germs if you’re sick.

Learned my lesson last night. Had a two top order two drinks and walk on them. Assholes.  But worse I had a mom and dad with three young girls 8-10 try to do the same thing. I caught her at the door and was like “ma’am I need you to pay your tab”

She goes “well I didn’t see you....”
I said “I’ve walked by your table 12 times in the last 30 minutes and made eye contact with you.....  (and in my head also saying) and who the fuck walks a tab because they didn’t see their server the minute they wanted to leave and the worst part ...WITH THREE LITTLE GIRLS WATCHING YOU!”

"Hey guys! This isn't a specific story, but I just need to vent.

I work in a bakery that specializes in allergy friendly baked goods. Gluten free donuts, cake, bread, you name it. However, we do also have ""regular"" baked goods which we primarily use for making sandwiches for people. Of course then we do have gluten free alternatives for those, which are in high demand. Here's the problem, though. We have so many customers who come in claiming to have SEVERE celiac disease, but will then get mad at us for ""spending so much time"" preparing the gluten free food because ""we could've just used the ingredients that was already prepared for the regular sandwiches"" cue us then trying to say that there's definitely traces of gluten in them, and then they suddenly don't have SEVERE celiac disease anymore, ""lots of it just makes them gassy"". 

And sure, if that's the case, great, we'll happily serve you and prepare gluten free for you, but now you've held up a long line of customers unnecessarily because we had to go the 100% gluten free route with your order when you didn't even need that. 

Another annoying thing is when customers come up buying a lot of our gluten free stock because, and I quote ""I've heard gluten is supposed to be like so bad for you so I've gone completely gluten free to rinse my body. Like, I read it on Instagram"" okay, but do you need to buy half our stock of it so that people with ACTUAL celiac disease who travel an hour just to get to the only gluten free bakery in the district won't get any?  Our grocery stores have lots of gluten free alternatives these days. Don't ruin it for the people who can't just go anywhere to have a treatAccomedating to Celiac Disease",TalesFromYourServer

I then, as part of my opening speech, ask if they would like a cheese dip. Her response is “well shit how much is it?” And in my head I’m thinking “what the hell does it matter, you just ordered a $8 dollar drink?” And I tell her the price of our $3 cheese dip that the kids obviously all want, but she refuses.

 Anyhow, they had come in not even 5 minutes before closing. The kitchen closes 15min early, but still decided to make them their food. 
 I take it out to them, and not even a minute later,  they ask for more.  Of course, I go to the kitchen to ask if it's okay. They sighed and gave me the okay. 
 I take them their second round of food and they decide they  were gonna stay  for a hella long time.

They didnt leave until 730. We close at 7.

"I work at a hotel bar. A group of three came in early-ish in the evening and I got a vibe that they weren’t the going to tip well right from the start. I’ve served folks that carried themselves in similar fashions who didn’t, but, I’m open to being surprised! 

One of the guys is celebrating his birthday! They’re chatty and kind of fun so I think okay, I can snag a coupon from the front desk and let him have a mixed drink on the house for his special night. His girlfriend orders a holy water and we joke about being basic bitches, we’re having a good time so far! 

They order a few shots and more mixed drinks and beer, eventually the bill is just shy of $110. The third fella, who seems to be third-wheeling it for his buddy’s birthday, asks what the bill is and brings out his wallet. Puts $120 in cash down, I grab him his change, and his pals get up and leave. One fella at the bar asks, “Did they leave you anything?” 
I still have a smile on my face. “No, and I could’ve made a lot of money had I bet on it too.”

Half a hour later they come back down for a smoke and birthday boy orders some drinks for the room. We get talking while I’m whipping them up and turns out he’s from my neck of the woods on the other side of the country! We reminisce about the mountains and the mild winters, smiles all around. He pays for his bill in cash, takes the change I got him and puts it in his pocket and once again walks away. I’m still smiling. The guy at the bar is shocked that I am not fuming. Eh, the hourly pays my rent, but the night is not off the a very great start, mentally I have already thrown in the towel. 

Some time goes by and a bunch of friends come by the bar. Whiskey and ginger ale are flowing, 3 rounds of tequila, caesars and beer galore. I’m happy to be busy, I wasn’t expecting it on a Saturday (they’re quite hit or miss), but I’m getting into the groove and doing my best to chat and entertain while making drink after shot after drink. They all pay up and tip accordingly, some $1/drink, others just hit 15% on the machine, but I don’t think the night can really be salvaged despite the slight change in mood. 

Most file out apart from two from the busy group, they’re enjoying my caesars and my company. We talk about life and vacations and music and even politics, they invite me to their nearby cabin this summer and insist they buy me a shot tonight. It’s getting late and I’m tired but these folks truly are splendid, they settle up and add an extra 20% to the total, she leaves and few coins in exchange for limes for the tequila they have in their room, and then the husband asks for one more drink to bring upstairs. 

One more ounce of whiskey and I give him a can of ginger ale for the road. Credit machine in hand, he types in the gratuity, shows the wife and she nods with a quick thumbs up, and presses “OK”. A receipt with a $50 tip, for one drink, prints in front of my eyes almost as if it were in slow motion. The tears are welling, and I barely manage a thank you before he says “this is one of the best experiences I’ve had at a bar, and you’re the bartender that made that possible.”

"This happened to my youngest daughter a few years ago now. She had a very brief period in between jobs when she was about nineteen and the Job Centre had a “ work for benefits “ regime that forced people into doing quite crappy jobs in order to get their benefit money. My daughter was sent to work at Pizza Hut in the next town over from us. No extra money for fares or to cover the cost of the uniform she had to purchase.                                            She did, however, quite like the job          One day they had a big party of people in to celebrate the birthday of a seven year old boy. Everything went well, pizzas were served and eaten, ice creams enjoyed and then it came time for the cake. Daughter was to take it after the candles had been lit, happy birthday sung etc, cut it up for the Mum and wrap it in the serviettes provided by the Mum. Daughter joined in singing happy birthday, the kid blew out the candles and daughter picked up the cake and pile of tissue serviettes. She had the serviettes balanced on the cake. Halfway back to the counter area the candles relit ( yes they were those annoying ones that keep relighting) and the serviettes caught fire. Daughter, trying to balance this flaming plateful,  carefully walked back to the kitchen area muttering “Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!” Dumped the whole mess into the sink and tried to save as much of the cake as she could.        The mother had forgotten to tell anyone she had used relightable candles. Daughter took what was left of the cake to the table and was apologising . The little boy looked at her solemnly and just said accusingly  “You made my cake go on fire.”  Daughter felt bad but it was not really her fault. Anyway when the benefits for work period expired the manager took her on full time and over the next three years even gave her management training so he must have forgiven daughter for the incident.

"3 things about my work:

1) 18% auto-grat on parties of 8+

2) hand-held card machines offers yes or no, then % or $ tip options and % lists 20, 18, 15, other in that order.

3) It doesn't automatically skip the tip option if there's an auto-grat (cuz you know nice people might add a percentage or 2 on top)

The practical upshot is that assholes who completely ignore me and treat me like shit all night frequently end up tipping me 20% over the auto-grat. They ignore me telling them multiple times there's an auto-grat (at the beginning, at the end, as they take the machine, it's on the menu too, and in the reservation policy if it's a reservation) and then fail to even look at the screen assuming the top is the lowest amount.

"Tldr at the end. 

I was out of the industry for about 10 years while working in the bike industry. Got out of that at the end of a season because big corporations ruined it for me.

So it was November and I needed a job to cover bills until I figured out what I wanted to do. Applied at a locally-owned pizza joint. Either BOH or FOH. I just needed a job. They had a great reputation for excellent staff treatment. Their online application had photos of staff trips and parties. Specifically closing up for several days to take the entire staff on outings. The website also said that if you were called for an interview then you pretty much guaranteed a position. 

 They called me in for an interview I was psyched. But when I arrived they informed me that it was a group interview. Jammed six prospects into a semicircle booth and two hippy type women pinned us in with their chairs. 

They started by saying that there ""weren't any positions open"" but if they found one of us a perfect fit they'd find a position. The rest would receive letters saying letting us know that a position would be opening if we were still available. But all of us were predetermined to be on the hire list or we wouldn't be here today. We all had great references and some had even worked there before. I get wanting to get to know potential staff before you offer them a job but then the questions begin. 

At first it was just industry related stuff addressed to separate individuals. Like asking me what I'd do about a complaint, then asking the next person a different how would they handle food allergies. 

But then... 

They asked us all why manhole covers were round and asked each of us the same question. Not that it's relevant but there's only one answer. Why are school busses yellow? After someone says it's to increase visibility what other answer is there? Because they taste like bananas? 

Then the start asking each of us what would we do if the lettuce was spoiled and the kitchen didn't have anymore? So one person answers that they'd change the special board to reflect that we were out of lettuce, the next would say call the produce supplier and request a delivery, and maybe the next answer was to run to the grocery store, but how many answers can you expect to a list of judement based questions? Then they'd ""grade"" the answers and berate you if they didn't like the answer IN FRONT OF OTHER POTENTIAL HIRES. 

""Amy that was an excellent answer but it was the same as Frankie's, we are expecting you to have original solutions, and Dani that wasn't an acceptable solution. We couldn't spare the staff in the middle of lunch to do what you suggested. Have you never worked in a busy restaurant?""

By the time 5 people had answered the 6th was just grasping at straws. I could see one young girl was on the verge of tears. I can still remember the downcast look on her face after not knowing about a fucking manhole cover. I was fed up. I told the interviewers to let me out. 

""The interview isn't over and we expect each of you to complete the process.""

I said this interview and process was over for me. To pit me against other potential coworkers, to embarrass people who were the last picked to answer questions that the first person had already answered perfectly. No fucking way am I going to work for you. 

I left and one other person followed me. We talked a minute in the parking lot and she said she was about to walk too when I spoke up. 

Several weeks later I received a handwritten letter that was OVERNIGHTED to me. All sweet talk of how after much consideration it was determined that I wasn't right for the team. Blah blah blah. 

But I shit you not, this letter was overnighted to arrive on Christmas Eve! They paid $17 to try and ruin my Christmas. 

 Fuckers. 

I had a friend that worked there between semesters that the fantastic owner had basically retired and left these two in charge. The business had faltered and the owner sold it instead of coming back. 

He said everyone was promised retainment, but the two interviewing managers had caused them so much grief that they were both let go within months. 

Tldr: I applied at a cool place only to find the owners had split and left new age idiots to run the place into the ground by pitting workers against each other before they were hired.

"... which are both illegal where I live! 

I have been working at this job almost a month, there’s one POS terminal and at the end of the night a few nights ago I forgot to clock out because my coworker was counting the register and I just left. When I came in today, I went to clock in and it said I had to clock out— my manager looks me dead in the eyes and says to me, “if you forget to clock out again, you won’t get paid.”

Excuse me?? I’m a pre-law student married to a lawyer and so I did a little research just to make sure, but you can imagine that doing this would be totally illegal. Even if it’s not, I don’t take kindly to threats about my fucking money.

My coworker forgot to ring in a couple of glasses of soda, nothing that is coming out of budget (I personally ring in drinks immediately before serving them), and the manager makes him pay out of pocket for them... which is illegal, because you need written consent without threat of wages (deducting hours, removing from schedule, termination, etc.) to deduct wages for things like this in my state, it’s stated on the page regarding labor laws/worker’s rights/licensing and regulatory affairs.

To conclude, I learned my training was over today and at the end of the shift, got tipped out. For 5 hours I worked and made $7.40/hr., which is super below my state minimum wage and I had no idea I was done training. 

The manager has an enormous stick in their ass and scolded me for not preparing something on the floor (is this normal because gross), but with the cumulation of these things, you can only imagine what will happen if I stick around. I’m already quitting and not even about to see the shady things going on. I really was hoping this was the right spot to hone my skills, but I don’t need people threatening me and I will not stick with shady business practices.

EDIT: I don’t know what’s up with some folks being upset because I’m personally not taking action against this place with only my word of mouth to take them down. Please unclench your assholes, you’d think there’d be more outrage that there are people running business like this in the first place.

Serious allegations with things like sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace have a specific burden of proof, and I’d imagine that accusing someone of threatening my wages would be the same deal. I don’t have any evidence. There’s other factors as to why I’d rather not mix myself up in some kind of situation with these people but I don’t need to justify that. 

I did what was best for me and refused to return to this establishment, I have no regrets, and I’m moving on with my life.Employer threatened to not pay me, saw another server paying out of pocket for mistakes...",TalesFromYourServer

"So I work in a franchise in the UK where tipping isn’t mandatory but we do sometimes get tipped by customers and usually only around a £1. I was working today and a customer handed me something and I said the usual ‘thank you’ because they didn’t have to do that and it was nice of them to do so. Then I looked down and realised I’d been given an old £1 coin. For anyone not in the UK these are no longer legal tender so it’s basically just a hunk of metal that I can do nothing with. So yup thanks for that random customer I would have been better off with nothing at all.  Sorry for the rant- I know it’s something small but it is just so annoying.

"a vent about dietary restrictions... and my manager/cook

I work at a Korean restaurant, meaning that most of the dishes are like,,, dangerously infused with non vegan-vegetarian friendly ingredients. Thus, we have options for people who would like them, such as bibimbop that has a little leaf next to them!! great!! please order these!!!! But they always ask me if several dishes, *clearly not labeled as vegan-vegetarian*, can be made as such. I'm sorry, but not only do I have like 10 other tables to serve, but I'm pretty sure my manager/cook hates me because I always ask if they can make it vegan-vegetarian friendly and I'm always going to him for problems with food from The Outside. The answer is always no.

As per example. I'm Korean and my mother makes [ddukguk](https://www.google.com/search?q=ddukguk&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS881US881&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02WOgDSDarR09Wjbr54AIXKBuv3IQ:1583598496188&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw0dOO5IjoAhUHT6wKHZDEAjUQ_AUoAXoECA4QAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=578) with an anchovy-based soup (toppings are usually optional). Other people make it differently: apparently our restaurant makes it with a beef base. Someone asked if I could take the eggs and other things out to make it a vegan-vegetarian dish and I asked my manager/cook and he told me no, and that I should know this. Perhaps I should have.

"First of, if this sounds kinda weird it's because the conversation wasn't in English and I don't know if I got the totally right translation for everything. 

So I work in the service area of a theater. There are a couple of stories I could tell but this particular one happened just a couple days ago and was really weird. I never had this in the year and a half I'm working here.

Yesterday I was at one of the bars. Right next to each other we have 3 sort of booths where each of us has their own set amount of drinks, snacks and their own till. I was at the very end of the bar, right next to the doors of the auditorium.

Shortly before the break started, a man sauntered out of the auditorium, went to my booth, slapped the counter and demanded an employee beer. At first I didn't even get what he wanted and said that we only have normal beer. He insisted on an employee beer. After looking at him more closely, my inner alarm went off and I asked for an ID that confirmed he worked with our company. 

For context, we do have special prices for employees, usually about half of what guests pay. But you usually recognize employees. If they are part of the cast and crew of the production we are hosting, they usually wear a badge that tells us they are cast and crew. Other people we recognize by their uniform and colleagues we recognize by face because we work directly with them. Not only did this man not tick any of those boxes, he also reeked of alcohol.

Back to the story: After I asked him for his ID he told me he didn't need to show one because after all he helped build the stage set. When I doubled down because I didn't know him and needed to see that ID he got condescending, proceeded to mock search his pockets all the while saying he didn't need to show me and to just sell me that beer. I didn't back down and the discussion ended with him wanting to speak my boss.

My shift supervisor was just a couple meters away because she was waiting for the doors to open so she could turn the music back on. She had followed the whole conversation and immediately announced her presence. The man went to her and started the same discussion with her. She only told him the same thing that I did. He even mentioned working for a company I never heard of before and got further angry when she told him that this wasn't the correct company.

At that moment the doors opened and a lot of people came into our area. The man sort of waved her off angrily and vanished into the crowd.

Later I heard that he told another coworker at the same bar just two booths down the same thing. And he got away with it because the coworker was new and didn't think anything weird about it. He just asked another coworker which price employees pay and off that man went. The nerve! 

It wasn't a huge financial loss and I get that our normal prices are quite high but still! I also feel bad because I thought for a second that I should warn the others at my bar about him but then I got overrun by customers and forgot.I don't need an ID!",TalesFromYourServer
"This happened a couple weeks ago.
I was serving at a carnival event and I was having one of those off days where I just wasn’t good at my job. The day started with me oversleeping and arriving late to work. Luckily there wasn’t much to do during the time I wasn’t there, so my boss wasn’t mad at me, shit happens and I’m usually a reliable employee.

The first customer I served, I managed to drop a beer all over the table. Great, now I can reset the table while all the guests are arriving at once and want their drinks. Shortly after, I expertly spilled about 10 beers all over myself. This day just keeps getting better. After cleaning myself and everything else up, I go into the break room to take a couple of deep breaths. I accept this just isn’t my day and my aim for the day was to just get through it without any more major mishaps.

However, I am still slightly rattled and a couple of minor mishaps do happen. Fortunately the guests were all drunk, having a good time and weren’t being dicks towards me, even though I was being far from a good server. They did banter me though, as drunk people do. I enjoy banter, even on my worst day, so I appreciated it. Much preferred to an annoyed Karen.

One guest decided to take the banter to the next level. While clearing the tables, one of the bottles fell over on my tray. The guest took the tray off me and wanted to “show me how it’s done “. He managed roughly 5 steps before most of the glasses and bottles on the tray fell over. His buddies laughed at him, I laughed at him and I think they all realised my job isn’t as easy as it looks.Serving isn’t as easy as it looks",TalesFromYourServer

"Foreign travelers are always a great source of hilarity and a nice opportunity to show off how friendly Americans can be, and boy do I get a lot of them. In my experience they‘re often some of the happiest customers because they’re excited by the bright lights of a new city destination and enjoying their overseas vacation. The hilarity comes from trying to cross language and cultural barriers that when combined make the whole interaction a little like two babies playing together. I don’t get you, you don’t get me, we’re still having a good time.

For example, twice last night I had the exchange of “How are we doing tonight?”

“Um...Pepsi?”

Cool, I’m doing pretty Pepsi myself.

The main thing these interactions involve is a LOT of pointing. I ask “Would you like another beer?” and point to the empty pint. They only order things with pictures so they can just point to the picture. They want to order a soda and I flip them to the right page and point to the list of brand names they’ll recognize. Barely any English? No big deal, we’re doing this whole thing pre-k style.

I keep my questions VERY simple to avoid confusion. When “Would everyone like water?” gets blank stares I just say “Water? Yes?” and they get me. When I know that’s the level I stick to pointing and “Good?” or “More?” or “Finished?” They give me a big smile and declare “Yes! Finished!” and we’ve understood each other. I always start with the assumption that they speak fluent English and dial it back until communication is achieved.

A lot of times the kids are better than the parents and we have a little translation moment. Out of respect I always make eye contact with the parent and speak directly to them, but when their teenager steps up like a pro it makes my job easy. Love those kids, little bilingual rockstars.

Then at the end of the meal they have to try and figure out tipping. Some of them are experienced at it and have no issues. Some of them will just hand over their card say a number like “80” and I have to run their card for the actual check amount and then show them the tip line. Some of them get that part but can’t read that they need to sign it. It’s a little adventure, but I like getting to show them so now they can eat at American restaurants and know exactly how to do it like the cosmopolitan world travelers they are. 

At the end of the day I know it’s scary to try and go out in a country where you don’t really know the language. It can be embarrassing to have to speak in very simple terms because that’s all you know. My job as a server to guests from around the globe is to make the experience as fun and easy as possible, and I know I’ve succeeded when it’s all smiles when the check comes. Don’t worry, we’re in this together!

"Honestly, this is more of a rant/vent than anything. It got kind of long lol but if you read the whole thing, please let me know if you think I’m being unreasonable or if I should just find somewhere else to work. 

I work at a local chain restaurant. If I was getting more hours it would be an okay job, however after Christmas they slashed my hours from around 20 a week to 8-10. And they keep sending me home early, so I’m actually getting even less than that. At first I obviously thought I was doing something wrong, but I’ve heard other servers complaining about hours and managers talking about how they have to cut labor costs (in my state servers make the state minimum wage + tips). 

Most managers will tell me I’m cut, sometimes a little early but never more than an hour, and let me finish out my last tables. One of my managers starts telling me I’m done sometimes more than two hours before my shift is supposed to end. This is especially ridiculous now that I’m only getting scheduled 4-5 hour shifts twice a week. It feels pointless to even go to work for two hours and walk out with $20. He makes me transfer my last table or two to someone else, regardless of what stage the table is at in their meal. I’ve expressed mild irritation at this before, but haven’t wanted to push it since I’m the “new girl” -I’ve been here 6ish months in comparison to everyone else’s 2+ years. 

Last week I finally just refused to leave until my last table was done. My manager cut me two hours early, when another server showed up. He told me to transfer the table I just started to the new server. Okay, whatever. All I had done was order their drinks. Fine. But then he started bugging me about my only other table. It was a four top whose bill was over $100, so it was probably going to be a $10-20 tip. They were halfway through eating their meal and had already mentioned wanting dessert and coffee afterwards. I was just like... no, I’m not transferring them. I’ve done all the work. He kept telling me it was ridiculous to stand around for one table (even though I was cleaning, doing dishes, etc. staying busy). Finally I ended up having to kind of rush my table to finish and pay out so I could leave and still get their tip, which I think was a little lower than it would have been if I hadn’t done that and I don’t blame them. 

I think it looks tacky to switch servers halfway through without a legit reason. I’m also frustrated that I’m barely working, barely scraping by, and now I’m having to fight to keep tables that I did all the work for. Is this normal?? I moved here from a state where I only made $4/hour (but I was making a *lot* more in tips) so no one really cared if you hung out for a bit to wait for your last customers to leave. In fact you got in trouble if you left without cleaning and bussing your entire section. Am I wrong for thinking this is bullshit? It’s only one or two tables a night and wouldn’t be that big of a deal, but with my hours being cut on top of this I’m seriously not making any money anymore.

TLDR; my manager keeps sending me home early and making me transfer my last tables to another server, forcing me to miss out on tips. I’m wondering if this is normal or if I’m right to be annoyed.My manager makes me transfer my tables to another server to send me home early.",TalesFromYourServer

"I’m not looking forward into going to work tonight because I know a certain coworker is also scheduled. I initially liked her a lot when I was first hired, she seemed to take the job seriously. She seems to think of herself as “head server” and often touts about having seniority over everyone. The restaurant we work at hasn’t even been open a full year yet. None of us has seniority. That’s a little annoying, but I can brush it off. 


Things started coming to a head about a month ago. Another coworker and I were cut, so it was time to roll silverware. There were guests sitting at the table servers are “allowed” to roll at, and the table in BOH that we sometimes use to roll was being used for food prep. So we set up camp at a server station, another popular area to do side work at. This station also has a POS computer. The restaurant has two other computers, as well as 3 smart devices that can be used to input guests orders and run credit cards. It’s the end of the shift and it’s slow, so running with one less computer is really no big deal. And setting up a rolling area does not completely block the computer, it just gets pushed back about 6 inches. 


Well micromanaging coworker absolutely cannot handle this 6 inches. She complains that her back hurts and she can’t reach the computer (even though there are other computers) and says that she needs to use this one specifically. Why specifically this one, I don’t know, and she’s the only server on at this point so it’s not as though the other computers are in use. So anytime she needs the computer we have to move all our rolling stuff out of the way. This is annoying, not a huge deal, probably added 15 minutes to our task, whatever. 


So other coworker and I are done with silverware, have rolled collectively about 300 sets, the marking trays are filled (but not over filled.) The restaurant is closed now, and we have been cut for about an hour. We get micromanaging coworker so we can show her our roll ups, an unspoken nicety for the closing server. She then somehow makes up this rule that we need to wait for all the tables to leave so we can roll that silverware. I thought she was joking, so I laugh and say no. She then undoes our beautifully laid out marking trays and tells us to roll those. This does not sit well with my rolling partner, and he blows up at her. They are having a moderately loud back and forth disagreement with angry emotions. I walk away and grab my manager because I do not get paid to deal with this. The solution for that night was we had rolled enough, and were allowed to go home. 


Cut to two weeks ago, a weeknight shift, two servers. It’s moderately slow, but busy enough for two servers. I get cut around 830, but I still have a table who is enjoying drinks until close at 10pm. My table leaves at about 10:15pm. I grab some freshly washed silverware from dish, and see micromanaging coworker doing her closing duties (sweeping, cleaning up coffee machine, etc.) Those tasks don’t take too long. 10:40pm comes along and I’m still rolling, and the closer is supposed to help finish silverware and dismiss the cut server, if there is that much silverware.  The dishwasher then comes out with another load of silverware, easily another hundred sets. I have already rolled at least 200 sets by this point. I look for my micromanaging coworker so she can help me with the last of the silverware, but nope she’s gone and left. I was really tired(I had been at school all day) so tired I didn’t even have to energy to be angry, but smart enough to know to know this is unfair. Brought it up to the manager on shift, he lets me go home. 

The following Saturday there’s a discussion about silverware at the shift meeting. It’s agreed upon that a cut person should roll 100-150 silverware, but does not need to wait around for more silverware to be washed. The last of the silverware is the responsibility of the closer. 


Cut to this past Wednesday. Again, two servers, me and micromanaging coworker. I get cut around 8. My tables don’t stick around, I rolled 150 silverware, and it’s about 9pm. There have been a decent amount of new tables for the new server, and the bar rail is also full with guests. Bus tubs are full, and in the dish room I can hear the dishwasher running through silverware. The busser comes up to me and tells me micromanaging coworker is talking crazy crap about me, how I’m lazy and didn’t do enough silverware. I decide to not talk to her, show my roll ups to my manager and inform them of the shit talking going on. He cashes me out and says I’m free to go. 


I just don’t want to deal with her today. At the age of 50 you should be mature enough to be able to handle a job and not do things only on your terms. She always has something passive aggressive to say. Once the Spotify list playing was a rockabilly station, she asked my opinion, I said it was ok but I’m not much of a music person. She then responded “Oh yeah that makes sense you don’t have much style.” I dress very basic(jeans, black nikes, sorel boots, plain target shirts )wear basic makeup, have normal colored hair and no tattoos or piercings. She has fun  hair and makeup, a nose ring, lots of visible tattoos, wears fun skirts and leggings. 


She’ll try to train the new people to not like a certain manager. That’s just being insubordinate. 


And she touches her shoulder length hair all the time. That’s just gross. 


I just don’t want to deal with her tonight.


Update- tonight she was the first cut server, there were 4 of us. Before she started rolling she asked the closing server if she really had to roll 100 silverware, because she only had X amount of covers. She always tries to change the rules to suit what benefits her. The closer told her no, to roll 100. We were a bit busy so the closer wasn’t able to follow up if she had actually rolled that many. Before awful coworker left, she came up to me and told me she “left a bunch of silverware in the back so you have enough to roll.” Sick of it.Dreading my shift today with an uncooperative, micromanaging coworker",TalesFromYourServer

"Hello everybody,

I am wondering if anyone might have any advice for my predicament. 

About a week ago, I had a bit of an accident, and partially severed the tendon in my right (dominant hand 😑) thumb. I ended up having to have a splint wrapped in an ace bandage put on my hand for three and a half weeks. I have about a week and a half longer in the splint, and things are really not going super great. I have about eight more shifts to do with my hand like this before I am able to really use my hand again. I just started this job fairly recently, and absolutely can't lose it. The easiest problem to deal with is keeping it dry. I've tried a few different gigantic rubber gloves, and seem to be doing an okay job at avoiding getting moisture on my bandage. The biggest problem is obviously that I am rather ineffective at using my right hand. My thumb is entirely immobilized, so I am not really able to grasp much with my right hand. Aside from learning how to bartend left-handed, would any of you have any tips or pieces of advice on what to do in this situation? I'm super frustrated and really need to keep this job!

"I recently started as an assistant in the dining room of a boarding house.


1. If someone has put their serviette on top of their plate or inside of their dessert bowl, is it okay to assume they have finished? Should I ask them “Excuse me, do you mind if I take your plate/bowl?” or is it okay for me to just take it? (especially if they are in conversation, I don’t want to disturb them but I've also been told that asking shows respect for them.)



2. When I give someone their dessert, what should I say? When I give people their main meal, I usually say “enjoy your meal” but that sounds kinda strange for dessert and previously I’ve just said “enjoy” up until now but that also sounds kinda strange to me. I’ve also had other times where I’ve not said anything, just waited for them to say thankyou and then replied “you’re welcome”. Is the last way the best way? (again, assuming they are in conversation, I want to interrupt as little as possible). Do I need to say ""you're welcome"" even or can I just give it and walk away?



3. Should I  say thankyou when taking someone’s plate/bowl away? Or can I just take it without saying anything else?



4. I’ve been told to serve from the left with my left hand where possible. However, at rectangle tables this isn’t always possible where I can’t get between two people and have to serve from the right. The same goes for clearing plates/taking them away, I’ve been told to do this from the right with my right hand, which I try to do, but it isn’t always possible and often I have to clear from the left.

"I work at a small local pizza/Italian place. A few hours during the days we offer a lunch buffet with pizza, pasta, salads etc. It's immensely popular and we're usually packed to capacity every lunch period. And honestly the food is really good and has a good reputation in town.

I showed them the salad bar, pasta salad, cheese pizza, broccoli bites, cheese ravioli, spaghetti etc. The mean sister yells at me ""did you not hear me? I said we're VEGETARIANS and this spaghetti sauce CLEARLY HAS MEAT IN IT!!!"" I said no, actually it's just a marinara tomato sauce, no meat at all.

After all that hateful deliberation they decided to eat the buffet. Ok, cool, finally we came to a decision.

A little bit after, I start bussing tables in between customers. Mean sister starts yelling again, shouting for me across the dining room, snapping her fingers at me, ""hey, MISS! EXCUSE ME!"" I quickly walk over to their table. I ask if everything is ok.

Mean sister tells me ""not at all, this food is absolutely DISGUSTING and INEDIBLE."" I notice there's at least 4-5 empty plates on their table from where they've eaten, and she shoves them at me and I had to reach over to prevent them from falling to the floor. I was about ready to snap at them but somehow managed to say ""I'm sorry to hear that -"" and she cuts me off and rudely demands a refund. I didn't even respond and walked away to find my manager.

My manager has no patience for complaining customers and usually avoids refunds whenever possible. He refused to refund them since they finished off a few plates each before saying they didn't like it. Eventually they left in a huff.

We have several vegetarian regulars who come in and usually get a lot of compliments on our options. Some people just have a ""I'm going to start shit"" vibe and can't be pleased.""your food is DISGUSTING""",TalesFromYourServer
"We were at dinner with a large party, which I dislike,  for reasons.
At least one couple were ordering drink after drink.  Came time to order. I asked the waiter for separate checks. He said no. Okay. 
  Come time to pay. We added up what we ate, then added a decent tip, only 15%, this was the 80s. The
"" host"" collected all the money. He came up short, insert shock and surprise face here. I'm quite sure that drinky couple did not consider how much they actually drank. I for one, will not subsidize alcoholism.
  We left. Not sure if there was autograt. If there wasn't, I'm sure the waitstaff got screwed. As customers we did our best.

"So I’m a culinary student and I’ve been working for a hotel-restaurant in the heart of Budapest for half a year now.
Usual morning - bussing tables for the breakfast buffet. Today we had tons of amazing guests and I loved listening to their stories and giving them directions and ideas on what to do/visit in the city. 

Lunch rolls around. We had our quarter yearly staff birthday(s) first. This is basically how we celebrate the staff’s birthdays from the last three months four times a year on one day with a 3 course meal - the dessert being a slice of birthday cake. After we served that a few remained and our coworker in charge let us have one.

Then the À la cartes start coming in and I got a table of 7 - These Irish Gentlemen knew what they wanted from the start - knew how they’d be paying and we’re genuinely amazing about what I’m about to describe next.
As they came in they ordered 7 rums - so I bring those in first - orange slices and brown sugar in tow. 

They politely ask me to bring them 7 colas - separately and apologize for not specifying that they wanted rum&amp;coke from the start. So I get the 7 glass bottles of coke on my metal tray. You know the ones.

After putting down the first four I trip, hard - dropping the tray and basically headbutting the floor and dousing myself in ice-cold coca-cola on an already cold day. 

Now you need to know that I can’t handle messing up due to aspergers. Any mistake puts a ball &amp; chain on me emotionally and affects my mental health because I put myself down by replaying it on loop unconsciously.

My coworkers imediatelly jumped in to help by mopping up, picking up the bottles (thankfully none broke), serving the customers and by providing me with a new shirt and apron. 
Even the capital B Boss acted like a true leader and instead of the hellfire I thought he’d unleash said that it happens to the best of us and that everything is and will be okay. 

After putting on the new clothes I went to offer my sincere apologies the folks at the table simply said “Just have a shot rum on us, it’ll straighten you out for the next table, seriously though, no problem”

My coworkers, boss (briefly turned good leader) and these customers saved my day from being ruined due to my own head and I owe them my deepest grattitude. Thanks for reading!FOH and customer compassion.",TalesFromYourServer
"I’m a food server at a fairly prominent Midwest Casino, so I deal with entitled people on the daily. However, as I’m closing up our fine dining restaurant tonight, I just experienced the epitome of entitled.

The restaurant I work at stays open an hour later on Fridays and Saturday’s, but these particular folks are VIP’s of the casino, they are here every single day, so they know our hours. On top of that, they’ve come here for so long and so often that the Casino comps 100% of the food they eat.

So the story:

It’s about 20 minutes after we close. I still have a table celebrating their anniversary, so they are taking their time. No big deal, but due to this we are not allowed to close the doors separating the restaurant from the casino. As I’m tending to my table, I look up and see EL (entitled lady) and her husband NSED (not so entitled dude).

EL: Walks past the host stand and starts frantically waving at me.

Me: *arms full of dishes, so I give a slight nod to acknowledge them, and turn to the kitchen to drop off the dishes. I tell my supervisor we have someone up front

S: (supervisor) Hows it going, EL?

EL: Great! We would like a table for two, or we can sit at the bar since it’s so late.

S: erm, you know we close early on weekdays. I can see if (another restaurant that’s still OPEN) has any available seating.

EL: whips out her players card for the casino I’m an (upgraded member of the casino). I’d like a table for two please.

S: EL, we’ve already send the kitchen staff home. There’s nobody who can make your food.

EL: points at the only guests in the room But they’re eating!!!!!

S: They had a reservation for (an hour and a half before we closed). And they politely let us know they would not be ordering dessert, when we checked on their food. So we sent the kitchen staff home.

EL: brain begins to melt but....

NSED: Babe, we knew it was a long shot. Let’s just go to the other restaurant before they close.

EL: But we spend so much money heeeeere. They really can’t open up just for us?!

As I previously mentioned, the casino comps all of their food. They have never spent a dollar in the restaurant, aside from tipping (which they are typically fair at).

My supervisor just laughs and takes the players card from her, so she can get the comp transferred to the other restaurant.Open up just for me and my husband &gt;:( (x-post from r/EntitledPeople)",TalesFromYourServer
"So this happened around early September I’m a busboy at a sea food restaurant a 2 towns away from my town. We get up to 2 hour waits over the summer into late December, it gets crazy especially when the band plays (which is every night) and people start dancing. 

So I’m not sure if other restaurants use trays for bussing, I’ve only seen them used in fine dining places, which is what we’re considered except we seems right below that title if you ask me because of how hectic it gets. 

Anyways, I’m clearing plates, stacking trays and bring them to the kitchen. This is constant until closing and then some if we still have tables. 

It’s around 6pm when this elderly couple calls me over while I’m cleaning a table and I’m thinking, “cool they’re gonna want some extra tartar sauce”. But, the wife surprises me with complementing my work ethic. I was having a shitty night and this sparked a flame in my heart. The husband continues off his wife and also compliments me while referring to my name tag which is also a nice boost. 

I thank them and get back to work. After an hour or so it looks like the couples finishing up, they call me over again and the husband slides me a $20. I’ve never received a side tip higher than $5 so I was shocked, I tried to hand it back but he insisted. I went mach 5 the rest of the night. 

2 weeks later I’m clearing off this 4 top when this lady surprisingly says my name. I shift my gaze to see the couple from before and of course treat them like good friends, I greet them and shake the husbands hand. A few minutes later, I walk passed the husband and he slips me another $20 and at this point I’m like what the actual freak. 
I firstly accepted it this time and he told me how he appreciates a job well done. I thanked him before I got back to work. Just a story I thought I’d share since it was such an anomaly to me.

"Since this is one of the biggest restaurant-related subs, I'm posting this notification we got from our accountant:

**Coronavirus and Its Impact on Restaurants**

I just wanted to reach out and give you all a heads up on what’s going on out there right now with the coronavirus issues and restaurants in particular. We are hearing that various cities are preparing a protocol if a restaurant is named as a location where the virus has spread from – it’s pretty brutal – closure for up to 14 days minimum, and all employees will need to be tested before returning to work. Two bad issues there – insurance doesn’t cover the closure (it is excluded on business interruption coverage), and if employees get the virus at work, it is probably a work comp claim.

So, with that environment pending, it is crucial that restaurants put in place some protocols immediately while we work our way through this issue. At a minimum, I would suggest the following:

A notification to all employees regarding:

* Hand washing, with hot soapy water, should be done at a minimum every fifteen (15) minutes or any time they have come in contact with food or beverages.
* Employees should avoid touching their face or hair at all times.
* Tables/bar tops should be “hot wiped” in between each customer's use – again with hot soapy water and sanitized with a clean towel.
* Bathrooms, assuming they were properly cleaned, should be cleaned again every hour, including all surfaces hot wiped and sanitized with a clean towel.
* All surfaces, menus, door hardware, or areas where employees and guests touch should be wiped down and sanitized on an ongoing intra-daily schedule.
* Avoid handshaking with other employees and guests.
* Gloves should be worn by all employees producing/prepping any food. Also, gloves should be worn when sorting or handling silverware.

If an employee calls out sick with flu-like symptoms, they should be required to be cleared by a doctor before returning to work. While California law generally restricts an employer from requiring a doctor’s note unless the employee has been absent for more than three days or is without protected State sick leave, you also have to balance the ongoing protection of co-workers and the guests that could come in contact with the employee given the pandemic. Indeed, just today, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a local health emergency declaration for the County. Please discuss this with your labor attorney resource to decide what your policy will be, but you should certainly get notification out to your employees, so they know what to expect.

If an employee is at the restaurant and is showing signs of illness, they should be sent home immediately and can use accrued sick pay for their absence.

There was a false rumor regarding a flight attendant that had contracted the coronavirus and eaten at a Koreatown restaurant last week. Needless to say, all the restaurants in Koreatown were severely affected this past weekend.

"If this doesn’t fit, let me know. 

So a guy posted on Facebook complaining the local restaurant was out of these two sandwiches, how he was treated poorly, and how he will never go back.  

However, myself (and a few others) were there to witness the whole thing go down. 

He ordered a sandwich, and when that was sold out, he ordered another sandwich that was the same thing, just made differently (a hot roast beef sandwich and a triple which was rb, ham, and turkey). The roast beef is very popular and he went later in the day. 

He flipped out on the server, a 17 year old. I mean calling her all kinds of names, threatening to get her fired, etc. Cops ended up having to escort him out.

"Last night I was working my side gig when I had a table of 5. (I also bartend full time at another spot, but money, right?) Not super needy but definitely some dietary restrictions and preferences. Two of the group left prior to the rest closing out, so one guy went ahead and paid the whole tab, which came out to just shy of $100. As I'm bussing their table I see the slip has only been signed. No tip, but dude left his keys. I take the keys to my bar manager and finish resetting the table. Guy comes back in a few minutes later, and I had showed my manager the receipt when I gave her the keys, so I knew she wanted to talk to him. I direct him to her and keep working on closing stuff. She asked him about my service, seeing as there was no tip. He stumbled over his words but basically tried to blame his group saying they didnt leave him enough to cover the bill and the tip. She told him they were welcome back, but her staff works very hard and to please keep that in mind next time and tip appropriately. 

A few minutes later I'm closing out my last table, and the 21 year old who had one beer on special and a bowl of fries, left me $5 on $11. 

Honestly that $5 from a young kid that was obviously on a budget meant more to me than if the other table had actually tipped appropriately.

"This was a while back, but I’ll never forget it. I was working as a lunch server for a new (at the time) restaurant at an amusement park. This story revolves around a lady, probably in her 50’s who was dining with her family and very not happy about the cook of her pita bread. 

Her family was one of my first tables of the day, so I was at the top of my customer service game. They ordered and everything went normally. The lady ordered pita bread and hummus as an appetizer. No problem, I send their order to the kitchen and I’m told I have two new tables. I take my time greeting my new tables knowing that our food runner would deliver the appetizers to my table. 

I head back to send in my new orders and my busser is looking for me. He tells me that my table would like to speak to me. As I begin my walk over to their table, I see the lady standing by the food runner, and she does not look happy. I walk up to them, and she turns to look at me. I noticed she’s holding a piece of pita bread. 

Lady: I can not believe you expect me to eat this. 

Me (not knowing what she is talking about): I’m sorry, was their a problem with your food? 

Lady: A problem?! This is inedible!  

As she says this, she holds out the pita bread to me. I assume she is handing it to me, and reach to take it. She grabs my hand.. and slaps my hand with the pita bread! 

After the third slap, she says: Can you feel how hard this is?? This is unacceptable! 

Me, still dumbfounded: I will get you fresh pita bread right away, and you will not be charged for your appetizer. 

She just grunted and walked back to her table. 

I just stood there for a bit, before the food runner busts out laughing. After a second, I join in, I could not believe what happened. 

After telling my manager what happened, he just laughed, comped their appetizer and finished serving their table. I asked my manager at the end of the shift, and to no surprise, no tip. 

The funny thing is.. why me? All I did was take the order; the chef cooked it, and then the food runner dropped it off. Her slapping me with the pita bread was the first time I had even seen it. 

Good times.Have you ever been slapped by Pita bread?",TalesFromYourServer
"This happened a couple of years ago, but it was the most unsafe I had ever felt in a restaurant. I worked as a server assistant in a family steakhouse. The original owner retired and sold his restaurant to some millionaire CEO who changed everything. It was a place of memories for a lot of the locals, and it was affordable since you could order steak by the ounce, but the management changed it to an overpriced steakhouse for the CEO to brag about to his friends and clientele. When they renovated the place they split it into a bar section and family section. In the bar side they only hired pretty young girls, no guys on that side except for the bartenders. Later, they enforced a uniform that was a short black wrap dress that showed their cleavage. For some of the girls you could practically see their underwear. Everyone thought the dress was ridiculous, but only one girl refused to wear it. The bar side also had less tips as most people didn't order a full meal. The only plus to working on that side was if you got to serve the owner he would leave $100-$200 for the tip. Those girls would try to get promoted so they could serve in the family section. 

Since I was an SA i didn't really see much that was going on in the bar side, just that there was a high turn around for those waitresses. one day a server in the family section abruptly stopped showing to work. While it was common for people to quit, I was surprised because she had really good work ethic and didn't give her 2 weeks notice. Likewise a lot of servers started quitting and the business slowed down.

During one of the holiday rushes, a girl who was promoted from bar side to the family side was complaining because she got really shitty tables. then a lot of the male servers were laughing at her. i didn't hear exactly what they said, but it seemed like they were slut shaming her. 

It wasn't until later that I found out why. I bumped into the coworker who quit suddenly at a store. We started to catch up when she talked about a ""horrible incident"". i had no idea what she was talking about, and she said ""you don't know?"". she told me that the upper management asked the bar waitresses to join them for a drink. then they said ""you're going to climb onto this bar and strip naked for us."" of course they said no. basically, the management got them drunk until they did. i want to mention that the type of girl that was hired in the bar positions were usually the same: nice, ditzy kind of girls who had a hard time saying no, and for some reason they were almost always brunette. anyways, one of the girl's boyfriends called worried about where she was. the management told her she was not going to answer her phone. she did anyway, but they ended the call. another girl's friends were worried about her since she wasn't answering her calls. they enter the restaurant and see what's happening. they tell the management that they're taking their friend with them, and the management actually tells them no. they eventually get her back. one of the girls was 18, and their parents wanted to sue for her, but she didn't want to and since she was a legal adult they couldn't without her permission. 

i didn't have any doubt that it happened. the managers would often ask the girls if they wanted a drink. sometimes they'd ask me as well, but i would always laugh and so no thx cuz i was a lightweight. even shortly before i heard about this, one of the managers that wasn't present at that incident made a rule there was to be no drinking during or after work at the bar. but of course the owner's brother still offered me and the other waitresses drinks. 

i got the f\*ck out of there. I called my friend who also worked there, and also told her to get out of there. 

I had worked there for months without knowing what had happened. my friend and i were the only ones who didn't know, both girls. the guys never told us, some of which we were friends with. instead they just slut shamed the girls it happened to. 

although they were really slow around the time they left, the restaurant is still open.

unfortunately, the next workplace i was employed at had it's own share of sexual harassment. the owner and the owner's son would grope the waitresses. when the head chef found out his own daughter had been groped, he didn't do anything. his sons, daughter, and brother were employed there.Management Getting the Female Staff Drunk and Made Them Strip",TalesFromYourServer

"So, I work for a place that’s a cafe during the day and a nightclub at night. It’s an adventure, and I love every minute of it. 

Sunday’s are insane. Usually the Saturday night close is rough, but I’ve learned to expect that, and I won’t speak badly about those that served until 3am and just were too tired to restock some napkins. I get it dude. 

Sunday is also walk-in 10-16 top day. It never fails. We get large groups back to back. We had a 15 person table come in, and my coworker, Sam (name changed) had it put in his section, and it took up every table he was assigned. 

Sam is a great server. He’s been in the industry for years and knows his stuff. He was attentive, constantly giving refills, making them laugh, etc. 

As things come to an end, people began leaving, so Sam asked if the check was all on one. Everyone at his table just looked around at each other and it was obvious that they had not planned out whether one person was footing the bill or if everyone was going separate. Half the table had left at this point, so one of the older gentlemen said “I guess it’s on one”. 

Sam took him the bill, and after they cashed out, they quickly left. This table left him $7 on a $240 check. 

Sam was devastated. They had been there through the entire lunch rush, so he missed out on a lot of turn around that made the rest of us some really good money. He told me that he was counting on today so that he could make his rent, and now he wasn’t sure what to do. He was going to ask to work a double after already working a double the day prior. 

Side note: I get that people should manage money accordingly, but I don’t know his personal life, and some of us to live day-by-day. I was there recently, I get it. Zero judgement. 

I felt so bad for him that I printed off another copy of the check and put $40 into a book with it and stacked it into some books by the register. I pretended that I had lost a signed receipt and was going through them next to him. I casually opened the one with his name in it and said “Sam, you left money in here. You idiot.” And handed it to him. I pretended to find mine and casually walked away. 

He came up to me and said that he was super confused because he had only had one book at the table, but now there was this one. I just looked at him and said “some things aren’t worth investigating”. 

I’m telling this story because I want everyone to know that there are good people in the world. We all will get that shitty table or Karen’s or a bad night, but I’m always looking out for my coworkers. I’m a strong believer in treat the way that you want to be treated, and I’m hoping my message will inspire others to offer to do a little extra side work or bring in some snacks to share during the rush.

"It was right at the end of a nice, smooth, easy shift. I took some dishes to the dish station, and slipped on a wet spot as I was walking away.

"For background, I served for two years in my hometown. Small country town, big church crowd and I never received no tip... except one time. To be fair, he was the groundskeeper at my neighborhoods golf course and I told him how I used to sled on the golf course on snow days as a kid. Groundskeepers don’t enjoy that. Otherwise tips at this mom and pop restaurant were steady 20-25%.

Then, I moved to downtown Charleston. I was a server assistant for fine dining and the tips were NICE. A majority of customers were businessmen paying with a company card who weren’t technically paying for the meal. So, I did great there.

Flash forward to now, I’m on my third shift at a new place and can’t believe how awful I am being tipped. My first ever table here left me nothing! My service was completely fine. I didn’t mess up their order, they never needed a refill, I was attentive to them. Then later that night, I got left nothing on a $157 bill. It was my training day, so I didn’t expect much. It stings though when your expected tip is on the receipt doesn’t match what you get, when you did nothing wrong. My next shift, 20% of my item sales would have been around $80, yet I only made $27. Today, same thing happened.

The area I live in now is low income OR college students. No matter how broke I am, I won’t go to a restaurant if I can’t tip. Another thing is, because I am new, I am not working busy weekends.

Started with the usual crap of “why don’t you have a phone charger?” “Can I have your lighter?” (Also known as the game of ‘how many of my possessions do you think you’re entitled to‘) and lucky me, “I know you’re understaffed but I had to wait 10 seconds for a drink this service is awful “

"My first problem is that I’m not allowed to take time off, I have to have someone cover my shift no matter how many weeks or months in advance I ask off for. We have only 5 bussers. Only two work on Friday’s and Saturday’s and 1 on weekdays and Sunday. I get paid 1.5% of the servers tips split with the hosts and other bussers. one server will pull in $400 sometimes on a single day including the tip out already taken out.

Sorry formating, phone, 10 hour shift, 4 beers happily digested and english second language.

Worked 8 years in restaurant UP North in Europe, and usually new People are first trained server, then 'graduate' either bartender or host .

And both positions I find more taxing than server, strictly speaking competance and skill level.

But from Reading alot of stories I get the impression most start with hosting.
Why is that? 

While writing I think maybe, coming from a very sosialist society where all tips is Split equally depending on work hours among all, in other cultures the servers have an more important role?

"I work at a small volunteer run coffee shop and bookstore.

Today a lady came up to the till and said ""Make me a coffee with milk and sweetener.""

I said ""Alright. That's $2.50.""

This lady completely ignores me and walked away from the till and started to browse books across the store.

My co-worker and I are like ""Um..miss? You have to pay?"" But she ignores us. A few moments later she comes back and asked rudely ""Where is my coffee?""

I said ""You have to pay for your coffee first, miss.""

She got so offended that I told her that. She dug into her purse and tossed the coins at me. I put them in while my co-worker made her coffee.

"I literally just got hired at this place. I am relatively new to the serving world so I didn't think to ask the question about what a normal night in sales is like. I showed up Tuesday for my first day of training and, to me, it was slow. I am used to 14 table sections and this restaurant had 8 tables total. I figured since I would be taking orders and running my own food, that this would be a decent sized section.

Well, they were so overwhelmed they sent me home because they couldn't ""train me properly"" with how busy it was. The dishwasher said he has never seen the restaurant so busy before in all the years he has been there. THERE WERE ONLY 6 OF THE 8 TABLES FULL. So basically, it's dead all the time. I'm supposed to come back this evening to train but I need to call and let them know it just isn't happening. I should have done some research and asked better questions during the interview.

They are a really sweet family owned business but I have to be able to pay my bills and no way in hell will I be walking away with more than 40 or 50 bucks a night on top of the 7 bucks an hour base rate that they pay.

I thought this was going to be a great fit as I was trying to get out of the corporate world but it just isn't. I'm really scared of making them upset and I am awful at having tough conversations (but I need to grow up and start doing that instead of just not showing up). Even worse is that an older lady in my AA group is neighbors with the owners and she told me when I got hired that they have a really tough time keeping employees. That they've tried to retire and no one wants to work there. So now I know that little tidbit and it makes me feel even worse. I am feeling like a massive C word right now. I had a weird feeling in my gut so I continued interviewing which leads me to my second question....

&amp;#x200B;

Q: I had a first interview at a bar in downtown. The AGM was really excited because the last few people she has interviewed have had no experience. She said she definitely wants to get me in for a second interview with the GM who will make the final call but said they were trying to get someone hired ASAP for March Madness and all the events coming up soon in Denver. This was on Tuesday afternoon, and it's Thursday now. Do I call at some point? Or do I just keep waiting? I would really like to work there as they do 1000-2000 in sales a night and are only open on the days I am available coincidentally.

"I worked BOH for years, even ran a few kitchens.

But I worked as a server for a year in a very busy breakfast and lunch joint in Jackson WY.
We opened at 6 and closed at 3. At closing we'd put a sandwich board in front of the entrance door and send last customers out through the patio.

The manager was a full on hard ass but she supported staff versus bitchy customers. The owners loved her and wanted to know nothing. If customers asked for the owner she was allowed to say she was the owner.

One day at 315 we were cashing out when a 30 something couple move the sandwich board and come in the entrance. They stand there looking hopeful.

Manager: Can I help you?

Couple : we'd like a table for 2.

Manager: I'm sorry we're closed.

Couple: Closed! We just want a sandwich, can't we just get something to go?

M: No as I explained were closed.

C: I can't believe that! What time you close?

M: (who's had it) We close at 3 and if you'd bothered to read the sign you moved you would know that.

C: (and I remember it was the woman who said it) I'VE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN TO SO RUDELY IN MY LIFE.

M smiling: Well if you come back again tomorrow at 3:15 I gladly take it up a notch and really give you a story to tell!

At this point I could not hold it in and just cracked the fuck up. The manager gives me a look but then she loses it too. Couple storms out.

Of course a few minutes later the phone rings. M answers and says yes you are speaking to her,  yes I'm the owner, what can I do for you?

"So it's my day off. I had some shopping to do and decided to take my nana to lunch.

We went to a renown house of pancakes for their new cereal pancakes. 

So we get sat.....I had to use the restroom and nana chooses a booth...I prefer a table as I'm large and booths tend to be uncomfortable but I dont want to make a fuss as I know how it feels when I'm bothered with these requests.

So we order and about 10 minutes in she sits a couple who are already arguing about going Dutch, behind us. The woman proceeds to drape her jacket over the back of the booth, right in my space  

They immediately ask to have the table cleaned...when the poor server already clearly did it in front of them. She has to go back in the kitchen get another rag. They complain about the wait. The whole time they're looking at the menu they're loudly complaining about prices "" 6 dollars for pancakes, eggs, sausage and hash browns, that's ridiculous""

 so they finally settle on what they want. She orders a sea food platter with a ton of modifications....no lemon, no salt on anything, extra shrimp instead of hush puppies. Instead of her salad she asks for toast....butter on the side. Her companion chimes in to get the salad that he'll eat it and they get into a spat about him giving her some money for it. 

He gets all mad when the server tells him that the lettuce for blts is iceberg.  ""Eww why not romaine? You guys are just cheap"" he finally settles on something else.

We were just finishing up when their starters were brought and he demanded 3 extra cups of dressing and the server told him each pack would be 50 cents and he flipped shit ""but I need it I cant eat this without it"" the womans toast apparently wasn't hot enough and the butter not cold enough.

"*I’m a bartender*

I work in a hotel bar. Most nights it’s just myself working, and I generally enjoy the work. I’ve definitely had a few guests have a few too many and hit on me, but non have ever invited me up to their room for any reason. Last night a guy was by himself, and he ordered a few of my specialty cocktails. He closed out once and decided to have one more charged to his room. So he filled out the receipt and left me 2 $1 bills, one with “if you’re bored later and feel like hanging out with an old guy, *room number*”. I was definitely a little shocked, but just brushed it off and set it aside. Turns out, later in the night, I accidentally used that bill for someone else’s change and said something about it when my manager was walking through the area. My manager was definitely concerned and said he was going to have a conversation with the guy and security about it. 

I know it’s not right to take that kind of shit from customers, but I honestly feel bad for the guy who left it. He didn’t pester me, was the easiest customer I had that night, and just took a chance.Wrote his room number on a dollar bill",TalesFromYourServer
"Probably a bad way to put that, but eh. Blah blah blah on mobile.

I typically come in around 15-30 minutes early for work. It gives me time to use the restroom, make sure my hair / makeup / clothes are alright, and prepare myself for jumping into the chaos. 

Here lately, I've taken to hanging on in another place up the street before work, to minimize how early I come in.

Why? Because I have a manager that if I come in early, no matter how early, she'll inform me that's she's sat me with 3-4 tables. It's not a lot, and I can handle it, but I'm certainly not expecting it when I accidentally show up 45 minutes for a shift. I'd just hang around outside, but she'd honestly probably come find me to do something, on shift or not.

Admittedly, I'm willing to hop in if we're busy. Very busy, and at the request of other servers, especially if dinner rush came early. 

But having people out in my section when I'm not even on shift yet is immensely irritating.

"I've made a post here before and I've got several more stories to add. This is by far one of my favorites.

In my last post I mentioned working at a well known seafood restaurant. Well prior to that I worked at their sister restaurant, but this one was Italian.

We had a bartender I'll refer to as Brenda. Sometimes Brenda will pick up serving shifts to make extra cash. Well on this one particular lunch shift, Brenda had a two top in which only one of the two women would speak to her. When the other woman was ordering, she would look at her friend and say ""tell our server that I want blah blah blah."" 

Brenda isn't shy, so she says ""I'm right here. You can just tell me.""

Lady: (Looking at her friend) Tell our server that I don't look at people who serve me. They're beneath me.

Brenda just rolled her eyes and was like fuck this. She didn't have any fucks to get into it with this lady. Turn and burn. The lady never looked at Brenda or spoke to her directly the entire time. 

Brenda took it all in stride and didn't let it affect the rest of her day. But she didn't forget that woman. Her face was burned into Brenda's mind. 

A few weeks had passed and Brenda came to me with a story of poetic justice.

Apparently, while on her lunch break, Brenda had visited a department store at the mall just up the street from the restaurant. And guess who she ran into? The lady who was too good to look at Brenda was an employee there hanging up cloths.

Without hesitation, Brenda walked up to the lady and said ""Hi! Remember me?! No, you wouldn't. Because you don't look at people when they're serving you. Well, I'm a 24 year old in medical school who works to pay her tuition. You on the other hand are a middle aged woman hanging up cloths for a living."" 

She then grabs as many cloths as she can and throws them on the floor and says ""Have fun picking those up. But I won't be looking at you as you do because I don't look at people who pick up cloths off the floor."" 

She walks away. I asked her what the lady's facial expression was, but Brenda said she didn't bother to turn around and look. She got her justice and kept walking. 

I really really really want to believe that Brenda's actions kicked that lady into being more respectful to others.

Edit: Forgot to add that about 80% of employment in my hometown is blue collar. So for anyone to be uppity to another person is just stupid. We were all on the same playing field. So, not surprising to find that woman working retail. And we have a decent amount of people in our city, but not enough to be lost in it.

"My beautiful servers of Reddit,

We've had a bit of an uproar in our restaurant. One of our servers had a large party of early twenties boys on vacation in our town from New York. Our server is a lovely, bubbly, caring, adorable, little button that I adore with all my heart. The boys all saw what I see in her and decided to leave their phone numbers on their chit sheets. Every. Single. One of them left their number. She felt objectified. 

So one of the other girls on the team took a pic of the sheets and sent them in the work group WhatsApp essentially making a joke of the blatant sexual inappropriateness. Well our manager commented asking if it was joke. We said it wasn't. Well he decided to send message essentially saying that this server must've done something inappropriate with the table to elicit such a reaction. 

As you can guess, all hell has broken loose. Every single female employee has sent him a message essentially saying what the fuck how are you blaming your server for this? We as women deal with shit like this on the regular and you're blaming us for it? What the fucking fuck!? 

Well I realized, how the hell is our manager supposed to know these things if we never tell him? If we suffer with this in silence how is he supposed to help? It also became very clear that alot of our female team members don't know how to rebuke these advances with out submitting or just being silent. They don't have the tools to cordially let someone know that was inappropriate without escalating the situation and having a guest become angry with them. 

So ladies of Reddit, what are some ways you've found to deal with these situations in a professional and cordial way? If a guy asks if you have a bf or for your number what do you say? If they touch inappropriately what do you do? What are things management has done to back you?

"Evening chaps,

So I've been working in the liquor industry for about six months now, but today is my first day at a different store in my area. 

So as far as first days go, this one was nothing exceptional. A decent crowd came in for a Wednesday, and one older gentleman was flabbergasted he found a fellow lord of the rings fan. But that was all about to change. (Insert music for effect)

So earlier in the day this one guy came in. You could immediately tell he was a few eggs short of a dozen mentally, but nothing flagrant or obnoxious in his behavior. He bought a beer and went on his merry way. About an hour goes by and the property manager comes down and warns of this guy whose high as a kite drinking beer in the bathroom, causing a ruckus.

It was our guy.

He came back a second time and bought a six pack and a shot of 99. This time he goes and irks the rest of the management who unbeknownst to us have filed trespassing papers because he is becoming a public nuisance. 

But like the quote states, third times the charm. 

He comes back and gets a pack of cigarettes, and as he does the local security woman comes in and tells him he can't be here (remember, trespassing). He replies in some manner of buzz off, I couldn't quite make out what he said because I was with a different customer. 

It's at this point they both walk outside, and loud voices can be heard. The inflection in them denotes a less then pleasant conversation. Me and my manager hear this and move to the door to see what's going on. 

The scene we are witness too is absolutely incredible. He Is standing in front of an SUV screaming at the guy to ""hit him"" and that ""this is my lot."" No sooner does he say that a patrol car pulls up. Then a second one.

As the one officer goes after the guy to try and talk to her, he flips her the finger, calls her a bitch, then books it down the road. 

At this point I'm totally blown, because while not the most incredible thing to ever happen, never have I had the cops called on someone before.

"I don't know if this counts since I wasn't on my shift but it still happened where I work so here we go, I wanted to share:

Yesterday night I was walking the dog when I decided I wanted to get a coffee at the bar I work at and I noticed a police car was parked too nearby to be good news. Surely when I enter, there's this guy inside, totally wasted, banging his hands on the counter screaming for ""liquor! Two! And it's free! I won't pay!""

Needless to say my coworker, a petite girl, was scared as hell while cops were watching the scene from outside. The screaming and banging scared my dog so much she wanted to run away from the bar so I went out but kept an eye on the situation from afar in case I was needed, even though another coworker (off shift) and the boss were inside.

I took my eyes off of the door for *two seconds* to readjust the leash that got tangled when I hear screaming and turn just in time to see the drunk guy come out, throw liquor in the face of one cop and smashing the glass in his face. The cop pepper sprayed him and the guy ran away. Of course I catched a good whiff of the pepper spray and my throat and nose started burning like hell.

Droplets of blood decorated the sidewalk as I could notice as I walked in back again to get a glass of milk to stop the itching, while the guy was getting handcuffed meters away and the cop was drying his blood with towels.

My coworker was okay, her boyfriend arrived shortly after and she told me it all began because the drunk guy asked for a cigarette, a man gave it to him and he took it and slapped him in the face for no reason. Then he got in the face of another girl and started screaming at her, again, for no reason, so cops were called when he started demanding alcohol and banging on the counted scaring all customers.

I was told from another bartender from another bar that this is not his first time being violent. Let's hope this guy will stay home for a while. 

By the way my dog is fine, bit scared, but she got hella cuddles throughout and after the situation!

Edit: the guy was taken to his home after being to the police, where they discovered he was under the influence of something he recently injected and alcohol and put in house arrest (I'm not sure that's how you say it, basically he had to stay home for a period of time, as per the law).

"Forever ago I worked at a dive bar on Friday nights. Now this particular bar is a bit odd, an old biker bar that attracts a typically middle-aged blue collar crowd, but also frequently rents out the backroom for parties ranging from quincenaras to rockbands.

Anyways, it is slow near closing with one semi-regular and two other customers I've never seen before, some rough looking middle age white lady in baggy sweats, and this guy who has big fake teeth (I named him Gary-Busey-Teeth) whom I can't understand a word out of his mouth. I'm the only employee.

After a couple beers, the lady orders a shot of Johnny Walker Red.  When I inform her we don't carry red, but Johnny Walker Black she says, ""I don't want no [N-bomb] shot!""
Now if my description above didn't paint an accurate picture of the bar, this place has the look of one that you could get away with such things. Even if it were (which it isn't on my shifts anyways), the semi-regular sitting with just one empty stool between them was black!

I stare at her in disbelief for a second...""Are you #@!#ing kidding me?"" I ask (as the consummate professional I am). At this point she just happens to notice the other patron and proceeds to apologize profusely saying she was just trying to be funny and didn't realize he was there. My regular, Aaron let's say, was more patient and understanding than he needed to be, and was like ""whatever, it's fine.""
I cut her off, and let Gary-Busey-teeth finish his beer before they have to leave*, and think that's the end of it.

Wrong.

Well, she and Gary-Busey-Teeth start arguing, which I can't really follow because I can't really understand him, but escalates real fast and she stands up and punches GBT in the head!
GBT jumps up and finally chooses this sentence to articulate clearly: ""why are you hitting me on accord of this [n-bomb]?!""

I tell them to GTFO, but Aaron is understandably beyond his limit, and he and GBT start yelling at each other.

Rough looking white lady doesn't appreciate not being the center of attention. So she pushes up her sleeve, whips out a razor blade and, like Slash doing a guitar solo, windmill buries it into her own forearm. Like a cheap horror film I see the skin separate and for a beat it is just a gaping purple gash. Then the blood comes.

I immediately call the police say ""I work at [bar well known by police] and this lady slashed her self with a razor. She cut herself; the black guy did not do it!"" (Grew up in Jersey during widespread racial profiling)

At this point Aaron and GBT are face to face and don't see this, and she is screaming at their backs, blood running down her arm and onto the floor.  I'm worried she might slash at Aaron with the blade still in her hand, and grab her by the wrists from behind to restrain her while we await the police. They get there like 45 seconds later and the rest is a bit of a blur as I see this nutjob's blood all over my bar and me and what just happened catches up to me.

At this point i should mention that when she shoved up her sleeve i did notice there were dozens of scars, and she was well known to the police (and the triage nurse i talked to at the hospital after i closed up.

So I just recently started working at this salad bar and got put on many morning shifts. I've probably done 3 shifts myself with no proper training (I guess they assume I'd automatically know with common sense). Work is alright and the owners are actually really nice. But I'm terrified of the manager. Today I accidentally burnt a whole bucket of broccoli and coudnt wash up any dishes as I as serving a difficult and fussy customer. Then I got told off real bad when my manager came in. Told her my situation but she said that I should've finished my job before serving the customer (I served her a little earlier before the scheduled opening time). 

Mistakes started to pile up as Im a really anxious person and kept making mistakes after mistakes. I have a shift tomorrow and the manager is coming in to show me how to open to store properly. I'm screwed cause I opened up a new batch of soup instead of using the old one (I was told by the boss that we were supposed to rotate the soups we use...but eek what do I know?) totally terrified of getting told off for tomorrow and potentially even wasting MORE food.... Then got a call just now from the owner's daughter, she was really nice and diplomatic about it but regardless I feel like shit making so many goddamn mistakes today. I'm having exams currently and my mom being sick has gave me a mountain of anxiety that's affecting my work severely.

How do you recharge / stop making mistakes after feeling like shit after the first one??

Following mistakes : putting dirty measuring cup with the clean ones, giving a regular customer a smaller serving size (he used his own container and I wasn't used to it), putting sauce on the side of the salad instead of putting it in a separate small container (communication error), misreading an order and making an extra order instead.

God how do I recharge and go in work tomorrow morning with a fresh mind 😭

"Sorry for formatting. I’m on mobile and just remembered this sub. This happened a couple of years back when I was working two jobs. A little bit of background. I used to work at a family owned pizza and pub joint that was directly adjacent to a rather corporate and Boujee breakfast place. A lot of the back of the house staff worked at both the pizza and the breakfast place and I knew them well from being the bartender at the pizza place. I was really cool with most of them because when I would bartend I would always hook up an extra shift drink (out of my tips) and would always look the other way when the back of the house would bring their own alcohol in. Our head chef at the pizza place, let’s call him “C,” was also the head chef at the breakfast place. So C had a little pull around both spots. 

So some personal shit happens and all of a sudden I need to find a second job. Here’s where my relationship with the kitchen is important. It was extremely difficult to get hired at the Boujee breakfast place. They had almost no turnover and I knew this first hand as some of the servers from Boujee breakfast would stop by my bar after their shifts and get apps and drinks. For the most part they were pretty cool and I went to high school with one of them. 

Anyway I’m talking to the servers from Boujee Breakfast and ask if they’re hiring as I needed a second job. They said they just had a server move away and they got excited at the idea of me working with them. The excitement dissipated when the girl I knew from high school, let’s call her “A,” said “yeah but Linda (Boujee breakfast GM) doesn’t really hire male servers. And your beard will be a huge issue.”  I say that’s ok and figure I’ll try and use C as a reference and see what happens. Can’t hurt to apply. 

C gets me an interview. I shave my beard. A part of my soul dies with it. And I nail the interview and get the job. I’m certain I wouldn’t have been hired without C’s recommendation, so you better believe I had a case of beer hidden for him that night at the pizza place. 

Now I’m working doubles every day but it really wasn’t that bad. The Boujee breakfast place was very corporate and that took some adjusting but I was a professional and it wasn’t anything I couldn’t handle. I make my way through training and quickly adapt to the culture. The serving staff there was all very kind as even the servers I didn’t know accepted me, mostly cause I needed money and would take any shift available. This included hosting shifts. I’m not above working any job. 

Linda, the GM, however was not too fond of me. I have a big personality and I like to have fun and Linda was obviously wary of how warmly the front and back of the house warmed up to me. Linda didn’t like me from the start. Like she wrote me up in my first week for having facial hair when I had shaved that morning and had a little 1 pm shadow. I grow a damn good beard. But no big deal. I started shaving in the back bathroom mid shift to try and keep a good first impression. 

So one day I’m covering for one of the hostesses. Now every morning we’d have a team meeting where we would review the specials with the kitchen and go over any items that may be limited or 86ed that day. Our morning meeting goes about the day and we’re told we have everything. 

My only restaurant experience was from the pizza place so I had no fuckin clue what a secret shopper was, nor did I really care. Also no one bothered to tell me that was a thing. Had they told me, it honestly would not have made any difference. But I guess at the Boujee breakfast you wanted to get a secret shopper as if you got a 100 on your report, the owners gave you a $50 bonus. Super cool of them. 

So I’m hosting and I take a to go order for some dish with steak and eggs. I send it through just fine the customer pays over the phone. Less than 30 seconds later C sends someone from the kitchen up front to let me know that they don’t have steak that day and they can substitute another meat or the customer can order something else. Honest mistake. Whatever. I try calling the customer and it goes to voicemail. Try a couple more times and was not able to get ahold of him. Left a message 

We were super busy and the kitchen is backed up. I’m still New and very nervous that I’m going to get written up again for this. 

So the customer arrives and I told him I’m very sorry that we don’t have steak and he sees that I tried to call him. He’s very chill and says that’s ok can you bring me the same thing with sausage and bacon? A wave of relief comes over me as double meat prices out the same as one premium meat. So I can adjust the original ticket to the kitchen without needing a new payment. I run to the kitchen to tell C about it and he said it’ll be on the fly. 

The customer is so cool about the whole thing that I wanted to do something nice for him. So I ask if he’d like anything complimentary to drink and he said a cup of coffee would be great. 

So I ring up a cup of coffee and I don’t have cash on me (hosting that day) so I just pay with my credit card. Yes I paid out of my own pocket for the coffee. With my credit card which has my name on it. I rang the coffee up as a split ticket under the customers name. Obviously I tendered it separately. 

I give him the coffee and say “This is on Boujee Breakfast. We really appreciate your understanding and patience”

Customer gets his food in record time and he leaves with a smile. I had no idea he was a shopper until I came into work one day and everyone is whispering about me. Now A comes up to me and it goes something like this:

A: do you remember when we didn’t have steak last week and you took a carry out? 

Me: yeah I do. Why what’s up?

A: well the customer was a secret shopper. 

Me: ok...

A: did you give him a free cup of coffee?

Me: yeah 

A: Linda read the report and she is pisssssed. She’s going to call you in her office and you’re probably fired for stealing. 

So I start to laugh and A thinks I’m not taking her seriously. I let her know that I paid out of pocket for the coffee and she gets why I’m laughing now. 

Linda calls me in her office shortly after and makes me read the report. Specifically she makes me read the part where the customer indicates that I said the coffee was on Boujee Breakfast. She asked if I had anything to say for myself and why she shouldn’t fire me right then and there. I ask Linda if she checked the ticket. 

Linda makes a weird face and asks why she should check the ticket. I let her know that I didn’t steal anything. I paid for the coffee myself and if she pulls the ticket she can see my name with the time stamp. 

Linda pulls the ticket and I’ve never seen someone so disappointed that their employee was telling them the truth. She offered no apology and I replied with a shit eating grin. 

She didn’t talk to me much after that and I got poached into an office job by a regular shortly after. 

TLDR: I pay for a coffee out of my own pocket to try and amend a mistake on a to go order. Customer was a secret shopper. GM accuses me of stealing the coffee. I had a receipt that shows I paid for it.When you assume. You make an ass out of you and me. (Long)",TalesFromYourServer
"When I eat out alone, I usually prefer sitting at a 4-person table because I like having more space and my bag next to me. Of course, I *only* do this when the restaurant is mostly empty.

Yesterday though, I went to a café and it was literally just me, so I took a 4-person table. I didn’t really think anything of it, but one of the servers came right up and asked me to move to a two-seater.

"Let me set the scene. A busy Sunday morning at my low end sit down dining place of enslavement... Uh employment. It's the after church crowd. We're packed like always, busy and rushing around. In walks four people in their Sunday best. Two adults, and two teens. Turns out, junior here was on his first date with the lovely young lady next to him. Church and then lunch, like a good yeehaw Christian boy in the south. Mama and Daddy were proud.


It would not last long.


We put the two lovebirds at their own table and sit the parents a few sections over. All was going well... Until it wasn't. The two teens sneak off into the foyer, which is enclosed in ceiling to floor glass. Their server notices their absence and gets an eye full of them feeling each other up. Right in front of the host stand. And right in front of three families sitting by the door. She hustles over to the parents and as politely as she can, let's them know they need to rangle the kids NOW.


All three of them make a beeline for the door, the dad red in the face and the mom on the verge of exploding. As they get closer, they notice a look of sheer horror on all the customers faces. One mother is covering the eyes of a toddler. They round the corner only to be met with an image none of them will ever unsee.


This girl is on her knees, in her yellow church dress, fully felating Junior. In full view. On a Sunday morning.

"Hello all. Let me preface this by giving a little bit of background. I'm a young female who is currently still in school (well, it's online school, but that's how I'm getting my education.) This is the first job I've ever had, and since day 1 I feared I wasn't cut out for it, since I'm really introverted and have trouble/not much experience socializing.

I took this job because it was one of the only jobs I was qualified for, and I really needed the extra funds. All I did was apply online, and when I came to the restaurant to check on the status of my application, I was hired on the spot. I had about three days of training, and after that, I was put on the floor (which was a very busy night.) I did way better than I expected, but the whole night I was there, I was very anxious and only had two tables, but I survived the first night just fine, even though I made some mistakes.

Fast forward a month later, and I'm still working here. But here's the catch--I worked mostly only days where it wasn't very busy, and I only work part time. When dinner rush hits and our place is packed, I really get stressed out. I'm not a fast worker, however I'm good at operating the PoS, but I have to really take my time. I still make lots of mistakes, and I constantly ask questions, even after a month of being with the company. I don't even know how to properly carry trays, and I can hardly stomach taking phone-in orders due to my anxiety. We're also very understaffed and it can get hectic, with our busiest night only being three servers, two cooks and the assistant manager. I'm still not used to constantly socializing and working in this extremely fast paced environment, and the other day, my GM yelled at me and that really triggered my anxiety, to the point where I started experiencing tremors in my body from being stressed out. When I get anxiety attacks, I can experience long-term physical symptoms.

I'm starting to feel like I'm not cut out for this type of work. Even though I only work at night, I'm really starting to have doubts about staying here due to being very anxious and sensitive. I'm not exactly on the best terms with my GM, and I get so stressed out on nights when I have to work with him. I just don't see myself staying here long term, but I feel so guilty about already having thoughts of quitting, even though this is my first job and my family and friends are proud of me. I don't want to let anyone down, but my mental health has been taking a hit. Even on my off days and before I go to work, I get anxiety just from thinking about going back to work. Also, I've been trying to get my weekends off because I need that time to focus on finishing school, but my request for off days have been getting ignored. I'm just not sure if this is good for me anymore.

NW: New Waiter DC: ¨Deaf¨ Cook FC: Funny Cook

We had a new waiter and is was middle of the week no clients at all. We´ve decided to have some fun with him. 

Right behind the bar there were 2 windows to the kitchen. First where main dishes came out and the second where salads &amp; Entrée where made but also the dishwasher was nearby.

We told the new waiter to go up to the second window and ask the cook who was washing dishes to ask him for a pot we needed for something.

The guy goes up to the window and shouts.

NW: Hey the guys in the kitchen need the pot clean.

No reaction from DC.

FC: You got to speak louder he is almost deaf.

NW: Listen DC they really need the pot (spanish olla)

NW: Not onion. Pot!

"Not a tale, and sorry this doesn't fit the light-hearted nature of this sub, but I wasn't sure where else to post this. I'm an FOH jack of all trades (management, bar, catering, occasional serving) at a busy local restaurant and bar in southern Minnesota. Over this last weekend I've become increasingly concerned with how easily coronavirus is spreading and how long the incubation period is and how that affects our jobs. In my case, it's college town and the place is also in a hotel-heavy area that gets a lot of business travelers. The more I think about it, the more I realize how much common contact I have with people and how much I unconsciously touch my face or hair at work. Obviously not much, but sometimes you just get an itch on your chin or a hair falls in your face etc. It's obviously vital that I avoid any contact with this because much like many of you I'm sure, I don't currently have health insurance or paid time off. I have enough stowed away that I can float easily for awhile if I get mildly sick and have to miss a couple weeks of work, and I can afford plenty of preventative stuff, but I can't do a hospital stay. 

I close every Monday night and it was slow tonight so I just went wild on sanitizing our common shelves, condiment caddies, our office's surfaces/commonly used books and manuals and bags, and all electronic creens, and we got a few large bottles of sanitizer to leave by the entrances. I figure at the very least the sight of the bottles will encourage people to use them. At the end of the day, I think most people will certainly be fine but I can't escape this idea that it's our job to amp up hygiene awareness in our buildings while it's happening. Better safe than sorry. I feel like the midwest isn't taking this really seriously, and again, it's likely that smaller towns like mine might be just fine, but there are too many unknowns about it for me to rest easy.

"I got a two top yesterday during a very busy time. No problem, I worked just as hard with their table. They were rude to me and treated me like i was beneath them. The woman wouldn't even look me in the eye. I'd come to the table to check or just glance while going to my other tables and she wouldn't even glance my way. She'd speak to me rudely, harshly, and demand things from me. When I came to the table with her food she decided she wanted another soup and just kinda bit out ""get me another soup."". I did. The man at the table kept looking at me wrong, then he'd barely speak and instead just rudely use a hand gesture. When he did speak it was harsh and wrong.

They had SEVERAL rounds of food, I provided them with excellent care. I made sure they got everything they needed. After I boxed all of their excess, gave them their treats and more, these fuckers tipped me a grand total of $2. I have never been so mad with a table in my life.

So this happened after the summer fesitvities in my city and my boss gave me free from monday to thursday as I was busting my ass off for the last 2 weeks non stop making every shift during those weeks and they were trying out 2 new guys cause one of my coworkers left after the summer.

Friday night I have to come at 9pm and I arrived 15 min earlier. I ordered a coke and sat at one of the tables before the rush to smoke and relax before my shift. I notice the 2 new guys standing at the door talking to eachother.

Guy 1: You heard the head waiter will come today?

Guy 2: Yeah. The guys from the kitchen said he is an asshole. I hope I don´t have to work with him outside on the tables

Few notes. We had a terrace area which was split into 2 and required 2 waiters and it was always my area as I work the outside plus the waiting list. Also the guys from the kitchen like to tease with the new guys and fuck with them around.

While I listened to them talking shit about me I said nothing. 8:55pm came round so I stood up, left the empty coke bottle at the bar and pretend to go to the bathroom while I went to the backroom to change into my uniform. Once I finished fully dressed I opened the door to the terrace and stood behind them.

Looking between the gap of their head and with my hands behind my back I spoke out.

Me: Ok so which of you poor souls will work with me today?

They both turned around and see me all dressed up when I was sitting at a table 5 min before.

Guy 2: Are you the.. headwaiter?

Me: Yep. Now go inside and ask the manager who of the two of you is assigned with me.

Ohh the Karma when Guy 2 came out white on his face saying he will have to be working with me. He did quite well and I only mentioned a thing or 2 to him during the whole night pointing out minor details. We all went out drinking that night, kitchen staff included and they were pissing themself of laughter as I told this.

Guy 1 left after a month or so cause he moved to another city while the other guy stayed there until I left and is now the new Headwaiter. I pop up once or twice a month to have a beer and a few laughs with himServers have to mind their toungue when talking with eachother",TalesFromYourServer

"So we had these two kids about 16 it’s the boy’s very first date. He’s on one side of the restaurant his parents are on the other side giving them space watching to make sure nothing funny happens.

I already have a feeling about them tbh and lemme tell you my feelings are never wrong I knew something was gonna happen.

Well first they order nachos and mom comes and takes them because they were only supposed to order off the value menu but that’s not the bad thing we’re getting there.

So they eat his parents pay for their date I’m wondering where they are maybe the bathroom.

I have never been more wrong.

Nope they’re getting handsy in the doorway. So here the door is a separate room from the lobby. Anyway the host comes back and she’s going on about these people grabbing each other and being gross in the doorway I go to see because she over exaggerates and I’m curious. Low and behold I found the kids. At first I thought it was just first base touching so I offer to go tell their parents before they get kicked out. 

I go up to them explain the situation dad starts to go and as I’m going to the kitchen I see the girl on her knees... dear god no. I run, literally run to the first table in front of the scene and tell them to block their child grandma gets up and goes to the doorway, the open window glass doorway and yells at them right as dad is coming up to see his son being sucked off. He stands there shaking his head just not knowing what to do. Manager comes up and talks to dad the kid doesn’t care, manager really wants to beat the shit out of this kid but because his dad is there he doesn’t, also, lawsuits. 

I go check on all my tables and as they’re leaving son sits in the front with dad mom sits in the back with girl, I don’t think they’ll be seeing each other anymore....I Can’t Believe this Happened",TalesFromYourServer
"At the restaurant I work at, there are no doors to the kitchen. There are just a couple wide openings. One of the openings is several feet from the host stand, which is several feet from the door. When we're really busy, people completely fill up this area. 
It is just irritating when you're carrying a heavy tray of food and people are standing right in front of the entry to the kitchen and are oblivious to employees carrying drinks, food, and whatever the fuck else. Then they awkwardly take a couple steps to the side, realizing they're in everyone's way. 
One time, I was carrying a small tray with empty glasses and a family didn't see me or hear me say ""excuse me, right behind."" One guy turned and walked right into me and knocked all the glasses off the tray. And of course, right around a bunch of people.

"I'm typing this on mobile, so I apologize for any typos or format issues. 

Let's start with a little background:

I work in an upscale restaurant in a very nice part of town. We never really have any disruptive issues with our guests, even if a server totally botches an order. The only complaints we ever receive is the amount of time it takes for orders to hit the table or that the food is too spicy. It's a really chill and sweet gig. 

About a month ago our sister store on the not so pleasant side was closed down for good. Many of their customers migrated to our restaurant. Servers usually make around $140-200. However, since the closure of the sister store, the tips have been plummeting while the complaints are ridiculous and at all time high. 

THE STORY:

Last night 6 people arrived requesting a table for 10. The hostess immediately sat them and there was an attempt to greet them. When the server approached, before she could even say hello, the guests began order entrees in a very condescending manner. Keep in mind they are still waiting on 4 other people to arrive. After the order was taken the server asked for drinks and was ignored. As she was leaving to put appetizers in and grab them waters things started escalating. You could hear everything that was happening with this table from the kitchen which was just a few feet away. 

Guest 1: WHERE is she going??

Guest 2: I think she's getting appetizers

Guest 1: But she didn't even ask us for drinks!!

*server approaches with tray of waters*

Guest 1: I didn't ask for that

Server: I brought water for everyone. Can I get y'all something else?

Guest 1: *shoves water glass back at server, spilling most on her*  

Guest 3: You didn't even bring lemons? *scoff* Bring me a pepsi.

As the server gets their drinks, she's asking around if anyone else would like the table. She somehow managed to keep her cool after the series of events unfolding. Of course no one would voluntarily take care of that nightmare table. When she brought out the appetizer it was game over for everyone. Guest 5 claims they were given dirty silverware. The odds of this happening are very slim, unless there was a lazy server that didn't care about what they were rolling. I didn't get to see the silverware so I can neither confirm nor deny it. 

In unison, the six of them get up and start heading towards the door, tabs not paid yet. The manager was at the host stand and guest 1 begins to go off in his face.

""Our server was RUDE and our silverware was GROSS. Are you the MANAGER?""

""Yes sir. Please lower your voice and tell me what happened so that we can fix it"" 

""WHAT IS YOUR NAME""

""My name is ___""

""I NEED YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR ME. I'M CALLING CORPORATE""

""I just told you my name. It's ___.  I don't feel comfortable writing it down for you, sir.""

""YOU ARE A FUCKING PRICK!""

""If you don't calm down I will call the police""

""FUCKING CALL THEM. I DON'T CARE""


At this point the manager gets his phone and dials 911 seeing that this guest was going full Karen and there was no calming him down. It looked like it was going to get physical. 

They almost immediately left, and the police arrived shortly afterwards. After they were told what happened, they told us to call them again if we see them in the restaurant so that we can officially ban them. After that incident the restaurant was damn near silent. I hope we never have to see them again.

"\*obligatory mention that I don't use Reddit often

I am 21 and I've worked at this family-owned restaurant for like 3 years. I started out as a hostess and bumped my way up to server. I'm moving to another town, and I really like serving, so I'd be interested in doing it there as well.

I love my job, but the way this place handles things is questionable. I've seen so many servers come in sick and not be able to leave. Today I woke up with a fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and this terrible chest pain. I opened, so I knew I wouldn't find anybody to work for me on such short notice. I asked in our messenger app, but nobody answered. If we don't find somebody to cover our shift it counts as a no call/no show and we get fired. I came in, couldn't even lift up a plate because I was so weak. I had to have another server run all of my food. It hurt terribly to walk because my joints were so sore. A few months ago we had to fill out a contract after a health department inspection. It said if we were sick, we had to call off. Yet, all of us have to come in when we're sick. It was Sunday morning, an hour before my shift, how could I get a doctor's note? I recall last year a year a girl had scarlet fever with a horrible rash and she couldn't leave until our rush was over. I feel awful because our restaurant is very popular with the elderly crowd. I know we are all pretty hygienic and wash our hands, but I feel so guilty.

I understand not wanting to be understaffed - trust me, I know the feeling. We only have maybe 30 tables in the place, and only have up to 4 or 5 servers on at once. Sunday mornings we have 3 servers and one bartender.

I really love all of my coworkers, I enjoy the money, and I love my customers. There's nothing better than pleasing a table. If most places are like this, I think I need to find a new area to work in. What is your guys' experiences with being sick in a restaurant?Are all restaurants like this?

"Eight hungover college students. One didn't like her food, so she got a remake. Sorry that a medium-well burger ordered AFTER the rest of your party already had their food didn't come out instantaneously. We boxed it for her and of course didn't charge for the original uneaten dish. Nothing wrong with it.

They all ordered coffee and soda at different times. You know, everytime I brought a soda back, someone else wanted one. I was very good about refills. I forgot one person's soda one time, and she got it as soon as she reminded me (she had water in front of her, she was not parched lol).

One told me she could only have Heinz ketchup (we recently switched to off-brand), so I actually took the time to go back into dry storage and look for (and find!) a bottle of Heinz for her. Only because they were a party. I knew I was getting my automatic 18%.

After all that? They asked for each one to have a separate check. No dude. Managers have told us repeatedly that when it's busy, we are allowed to refuse to split more than 4 ways. I have no problem splitting a party individually if I'm told at the beginning. But these ""ladies"" all wanted to shout their food and drink orders and order out of turn. It would have been a mess.

"I'll try to keep this short. I'm the only host at a very busy breakfast restaurant. I had a lady ask to add her name to the waitlist for a party of 12. I told her it would likely be 45 minutes to an hour for a party that size. She tried the whole ""but what if we were 2 parties of 6?"" thing. I told her that I would not be able to guarantee that both parties would be sat at the same time, but it was up to her. She rolled her eyes and said nevermind, It'll just be my family, party of 4. Great - 10-minute wait. I seat them eventually, and about 20 minutes later she comes up to me and tells me her friends are here. I tell her I'm happy to add them to the waitlist, and if she's still around, I'll try to seat them near her. For some reason in her mind, me seating her party of 4 meant I would be reserving a table for the rest of her party, and they would skip the waitlist. (We have a large sign that says we do not take reservations on weekends). She starts yelling, arguing, the whole bit. I kept my cool, reiterated what I had said previsouly, and that unfortunately we don't do reservations on weekends, and repeated what I had said about not being able to guarantee seating her party and her friends at the same time. Keep in mind that she told me they weren't coming anymore and just to seat her party of 4. I was polite, but firm. Not really fazed, I'm pretty good at dealing with difficult customers. 

  
A group approached me after this interaction, and I braced myself for another complaint. The two women in the group very kindly and sincerely told me they were very impressed with how I handled that woman and her complaints. They also told me I was doing great, and for the number of people waiting, they were amazed at how well a tiny little 5-foot girl could organize and command the area. I said thank you and told them how kind it was for them to verbalize that to me, and said it wouldn't be long for their table. They told me it was fine, do what you need to do, we are happy to wait. For some reason I almost teared up - I was very tired and it felt so nice to be appreciated and recognized. I truly work my ass off at this place, and deal with a lot (as I'm sure all staff do lol).

"So I recently got a job at a local brewery. For the most part this job was...lets say, *decent*. They were basically a 2-star restaurant posing as a 3.5-star; they wanted the waiters to memorize the ingredients of all the food off-duty, memorize the beermaking process despite literally nobody asking about that, they had tests you had to take after a while or they'd withhold your tips...

Despite all that, 95% of the staff were decent human beings. Except for one. *Jeff.*

First, a little context. They claimed that they'd give you 4 days of training before putting you on the floor. Theoretically, you'd be paid a decent wage during that time, except for the fact that once you started actually working the floor they just combined your untipped wages with your tipped wages, so you're basically working for four days at 3$ an hour without tips. 

Still, you need to train, I get it. 

* Day 1: The restaurant is swamped with customers and they have only one server in the front. I spend the whole day running dishes.

* Day 2&amp;3: Actual training.

* Day 4(really day 3?): They get swamped again, and they decide enough is enough, and give me tables.

* Day 5: Introducing **Jeff!** Note that at this point I should only be on my first day actually being a server, with 2 extra days of training under my belt. He introduces himself by asking me if I'd been telling the truth about being a waiter before, as it certainly didn't look like it.

Talk about an introduction. I was busy, so I didn't have time to respond, but this sets the tone for our subsequent meetings.

Now we're going into the holiday season, so things are *very* busy, and I'm working full time. And while everyone else is supportive and encouraging, Jeff finds it utterly impossible to say anything in a positive way. I'd forget a soup spoon and he'd make it out to be the literal work of satan; meanwhile the kitchen is consistently sending the soup out at 70 degrees and the dishwashing staff are leaving 8 or 9 tubs of dishes in a line, forcing the waiters to basically do everything but throw the dishes into the dishwasher for them.

This culminates in probably the worst day of my life. I'm extremely sick, to the point where talking or moving makes me miserable, but I don't want to leave them shortstaffed, so I mention in passing to a different manager that if someone else wanted my shift, I'd be happy to let them have it, if they wanted some extra cash. Mid-shift, I have a rare 3 minutes where we're caught up, and one of the other servers checks our respective takes, and finds that mine is a full *50%* higher than either of theirs, so I offer one of my tables (that I'd already seated and taken their order) to the waiter with the lowest take, which he happily accepts.

About an hour later, this phenominal *douche* has the gall to come up to me and tell me that I wasn't pulling my weight. Because he heard I was asking to 'take it easy' and have less tables. 

He follows this up by saying that, since I wasn't pulling my weight(remember, +50%!!!) He was going to have me switched to being a busser after the holiday crunch was done. And he still didn't believe I was telling the truth about being a waiter previously.

*Seriously!?*

I very nearly blew up right then and there, but I was tired and sick and didn't have the energy to deal with his *bullshit*. So I kept on going, hit the end of my shift, folded every bit of silverware I knew to find, and asked a different shift manager if I could leave, and he said yes.

I clock out, and this absolute assclown comes up to me and says he didn't give me permission to leave. He sends me back to start folding more silverware, off the shift, using the crappy stuff they keep for the waitstaff. Not only that, but he said that I was going to have a test on the ingredients *the next day*, despite having barely worked there for two weeks, and the official policy being you were tested after a *month*.

I was raised not to be rude. But that night was the angriest, the darkest, I've ever felt in my life. I wrote some very dark things when I finally got home.

I knew I couldn't hurt him in any meaningful way. Nobody would take the word of a new employee over an established manager. And I didn't want to overly burden my actually good coworkers. 

But at this point, I have nothing left to lose. If I'm going to lose my job anyway, I'll do it on my terms.

So the next day I went to the office, told them I was going to work **one** more day, told them everything about the shitty manager, that my leaving was 100% his fault and everyone else was good.

That last day I worked my *ass* off. I worked harder than any two other employees combined. I gave one of my most helpful coworkers a chunk of my tip from the previous day, as thanks. And I left with my head held high.

I dunno, maybe it didn't hurt him at all. But even little things can stack up. And I hope that, someday, when his career comes crashing down, it was my straw that broke the camel's back.Chronically understaffed? Want to harass me every day?

"Sorry this got so long. I'm really awful at keeping things brief.

I've been a server for ten years in December, with my current company for three as of April. I'm also the only server who is cross-trained as a host and a cook (to give you an idea, I was in line for management before I figured out it wasn't worth the pay). So I've seen and dealt with a lot and have learned to just take the tables as they come and not sweat whether or not you think a table is gonna tip when they get sat. Treat them the same, get them in, get them out. The good and bad tips even themselves out.

Today we had a party of twenty people walk in, and the hosts ask me where we should seat them. Out of habit, from my host training, I ask, ""Would you prefer a table with chairs? Or a few half-table/half-booths? We have a party sitting at one we could use, so it could be about twenty-five to thirty minutes before we could seat you there, but if you want all chairs, I have tables right here."" I showed them the tables in my section where they could clearly already see them. The host of the party asked everyone what they wanted and they said they would prefer to wait, as most of them found chairs uncomfortable.

My manager saw the open tables in my section, saw the party, and asked why we were ""making"" them wait. I told him what they'd told me about wanting to wait for booths to be pushed together, and he told me, ""No, if we have space, we tell them where we're putting them and that's where they'll sit."" This directly conflicted with my ""guest-focused"" training, where you clarify all seating preferences with the party before arranging tables (booth or table, dining room or bar, need high chairs, etc). You ask every table, every time. That's how I was trained.

Eventually the party gets sat, and people are asking me why they're not in my section, even though the hosts and I BOTH explained that we offered them immediate seating at the tables in the front and they wanted the booths in the back. They didn't believe that people were willing to wait for preferred seating (reminder: none of these people have ever done exclusively hosting shifts, not even the managers, so they don't quite get how passionate people can get about a booth seat at a restaurant), and claimed that I wanted to pass them off to another server just because they were black. Yes, they actually said this. When I (unlike other servers) have never turned down a table or seated out of rotation. One of the servers who said this (claiming afterwards that she was kidding, of course), later told me the manager in question agreed with what she'd said about me not wanting a large party because they were black.

I feel like people should know me better than that by now with how long I've worked there. I've posted about this place before and I've felt it getting more toxic, but I've never had it directed at me, so it was really upsetting. Servers feel free to say awful things about guests on the expo line in front of other managers, calling them all sorts of horrible names, and refusing to take tables because of ethnicity and management does nothing about it.

I wish I didn't need the weekend money as much as I do, so I could just get out of there.Servers and apparently a manager think I'm racist for doing what I was trained to do.",TalesFromYourServer
"My tables for the evening were a 6 top, 2 top, and two 4 tops in that order. Midway through shift, in walks an elderly couple. My 6 top has four adults, a sleeping baby, and a relatively quiet child; my first four top was dirty leaving my two and last four top. My manager is hosting cause we were busy, on a wait, and the other hosts were either seating or grabbing seats for children.  


I can see that she was attempting to sit them at my open and clean two top, but they were making (and by they, I mean she) this uppity, privileged, I get what I want face while pointing at my open four top. I know my manager and she is not great at hiding her RBF when she gets annoyed. I brace for impact when manager seats them and approaches me...  


Manager: ""The lady rudely told me that they wanted to sit at that table because they ""CaNt SiT NeXt To KiDs.""

Me: ""Oh joy. Maybe I can turn and burn em quick.""

Manager: ""Oh don't worry, i'm gonna clean off the other four top and FILL it with children.""

Me: ""Yeah, hahaha...wait what???""

Normally I am also a big fan of malicious compliance and giving what tables give to me. But there is one important thing I must mention; I also don't like children...here. Most of the time they are sweet and have some forced politeness; unfortunately since its a richer neighborhood, the kids are sometimes hyper and very privileged. Like, two 8 year olds each with Airpods and tablets, screaming they want a Mac and Cheese before I have even finished my greeting. That day alone I got both ends of my no-no danger zones repeatedly wacked by children and was not looking forward to more fuckery.

I go to greet the elderly couple and am hit with, ""Look, we both just want some water and if you can just keep it full all evening that would be greeeeeat."" Dripping with condescension and finished with that weird, squinty, fake smile smile you give when you are telling someone and not asking. 

I grab the waters, walk up to the manager. She see's the fire and brimstone in my eyes.  


Me: ""I'm going to scorch the earth, you salt the wound.""

Manager: ""Heard.""  


They took a sip, I appeared with a pitcher of water. Every few moments I step in with a ""can I take your glass?"" In the meantime, a table of four appears with two very hyper children, manager steps in a seats them right at my recently cleaned four top; coincidentally next to my elderly couple who are looking very annoyed by the new arrivals.

""I am sorry about the noise in here today, soccer kickoff and we are just packed to the brim. Nothing we can do. Doing good on water? Greeeeeat.""

In the end, they tipped me 30% for my ""attentiveness"" and left without a fuss. I told the manager and was pretty pleased with the situation for a moment.

Manager: ""Glad it ended better than it started. BTW one of the children at that four top is finger painting on the table with the mustard.""

"I’ve been a host for two months and everyone I work with agrees that I pretty much have it down. Most of the servers I work with are amazing and I couldn’t ask for better coworkers. However just like with any workplace I have a few bitchy or whiny servers. I’ve only ever got yelled at twice. The first time was my second week and a server was stressed and yelled at me for no reason (he admitted that he was being a bitch). I personally think it’s because I was new and quiet, however I did tell him that the next time he has a problem he needed to speak to me with respect. We apologized and he has never disrespected me again.

The second time was today and a server was stressed out but we keep seating her because we didn’t know. She said we should’ve used our intuition and known to put her on hold. She only had 3 tables and we sat her with a 4th (all were 6 tops or less) though and she’s been working there for 15 years. Almost all of our servers even the new ones can handle at least 4 tables some up to 9 at once. I understand that serving is hard and stressful but I don’t think this gives them the right to take all their frustrations out on host (unless the host really fucks up ofc). She came up and yelled at me because we couldn’t read her mind and I bit my tongue. Then she came back up to yell at my other host and I told her to calm down and that I felt she was talking to us in a disrespectful tone which I wasn’t going to stand for. My other host tried to explain to her that she needed to tell us next time but the server ignored her and basically said we were dumb. The other host then just started kissing her ass and apologizing. After a while I went to talk to her again and apologize and we made up. However the other host was upset because I stood up for us and we get paid part of their tips. I honestly didn’t think about the tips thing so I promised never to do it again when other host were on the tip-share with me.

However the most we make is 10/hr on a busy day. I feel like it is not worth it to be constantly getting disrespected and kissing up to people, especially because that isn’t a livable wage. I also feel that money will never be as important as my self worth. I was bullied all through school and went into a deep depression in 10th grade which caused me to lose my will to live literally. After that I didn’t let anybody treat me however they wanted to. I will never be a push over again. I always stood my ground, so maybe this has to do with my feelings. I don’t have the energy to get in a full blown fight with them though. I have never gone past asking for respect. After that I just stop talking if they continue to yell.

"I serve tables in a cafe, breakfast and lunch, typically, with mostly older clientele. A lot of older people, sometimes with their grown up kids, and their grandchildren. We're doing a Friday night fish fry for Lent, and I have been selected by my boss (thanks) to serve those nights.

I had a regular come in, and older gentleman with his wife, who is now in an elderly care facility. She doesn't come out much, but they would both come the restaurant regularly with all their kids, grandkids, etc, especially for the fish fry.

They come with their eldest son, we'll call him Keith, and say that there's going to be 6 more joining. So I get a table ready, and take their drink orders for just the three of them. Normally, I would set out waters for everyone waiting, but it was slow that night, so I didn't have to rush-rush things as I normally would, so I took things naturally slow and casually.

Ten minutes go by, and the others still haven't shown up. I go tell them that if they would like to order while they wait for the others, or just wait, whatever. I'm in no big hurry. They just order a couple of appetizers and say they'll order full meals when the rest arrive. 

I bring out the appetizers and let them enjoy it. Shrimp cocktails with a spicy twist. They love it.

Twenty minutes go by, still no family. I ask if they are ready to order, or still want to wait? They say they can wait. I have no problem with that, and go to serve my other tables. My mom comes in. I smile and sit her and serve her food. Not really part of the story, but that's what happened while I was still waiting for the family.

Another ten minutes. The family still isn't here. It's been 45? minutes so far, so I ask again if they are hungry. They are pretty fed up with the rest, since they live right around the corner, according to them. They order their plates (the plates are actually named after them,  Keith's BBQ Shrimp, his recipe) and the potatoes we serve in the morning are named after the last name of the parents.  I bring them their food, and they sit and eat for a while longer. I bring out their complimentary desserts, they pay, and eventually leave.

Then five minutes later, FIVE MINUTES, the family shows up. I've already cleaned up the table and reset everything when they come in. I turn around, recognizing them, and tell them that Keith and their parents already left. 

The son of the parents looks at me, and says... ""I KNOW. WE WERE WAITING FOR THEM TO LEAVE.""

They were tracking them with the apps on their phone, waiting for them to leave, so they didn't have to spend a meal with them.

I was aghast. My mother thought it was a joke. I assured her, the tone of his voice told me it wasn't a joke. He was dead serious.

Please spend time with your family, especially the elders. You don't know how much time you have left.A Most Horrible Family",TalesFromYourServer
"The other day I had a gentleman come in with whom I assume is his mother. I ask them if they want a table or booth, they say table so I start to take them to our smallest available table (a 4 top). They stop and sit down at an 8 top saying “we always sit here”. Fine whatever. 

They order and the mom gets a turkey melt, and the son gets the entree buffalo chicken Mac and cheese, and two double bacon cheese burgers one with normal fries and the other with loaded cheese fries.

As they’re sitting at this huge table eating their food we start getting busy, and a large table walks in, and it’s my turn in rotation, only I can’t take them as I don’t have a table large enough to seat them, since these two are at the 8 top.

They finish their dinner and I ask if they want any dessert. The gentlemen (if I can even call him that) orders our largest dessert that I can share with my boyfriend and we’ll both be stuffed. And he eats all of it. 

So finally the time comes where I bring their bill, it was $64.90 or something like that. He gives me $65 and says “keep the change”. So I start getting Alittle upset but I remain calm and hopeful as this man and his mom proceed to sit at the table for another hour plus just chit chatting. I go over and refill their drinks and make sure their alright hoping they’ll leave cash when they get up.

Sure enough, when they get up to leave they leave no extra money. So not only did they tip me 10 cents, they occupied a table meant for a party much larger than theirs for 3 turntimes, making me miss out on big bills who apparently all tipped 18% or more I found this out in speaking to their servers)

"Got two recent negative reviews today complaining about ""rude servers"" and how we were ""unhelpful"" because the server who helped them told them that they cannot switch our ramen broth from pork to anything else like beef or chicken...because we LITERALLY don't have any other type of broth besides pork! We literally don't have beef broth or chicken broth ANYWHERE in the restaurant. We specialize in hakata-style ramen (called such because this ramen style originated from the city of Hakata in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, the defining characteristic of hakata-style ramen is that it uses thin, straight noodles instead of the curly type so that it soaks up the soup via capillary action--hence why if you've ever had hakata-style ramen and you don't eat it fast enough, you often end up with more noodles and less or no soup, because all the soup has been sucked up into the noodles) which is traditionally a tonkotsu ramen! 

I stopped by once to ask if they had any questions and the girl asked me if she didn't want pork could she get beef instead and I told her that yeah, but it wouldn't be a straight substitution, we would still have to upcharge her for the beef because it costs more than the chashu that we put in our ramen, and that while she can substitute the meat the broth would remain pork--they were actually in my section but the other server was adamant on helping them since his section was pretty dead, which I was fine with and plus it was almost time for me to clock out anyway since I had only 10 minutes left before my shift was supposed to end. 


And in their 1 star Yelp review they mentioned getting udon instead but how the broth was pork...except our udon broth is fish-based! It even says so right there in the menu that our udon broth is fish-based! The reason the server who helped you two never said the udon broth was pork broth is because it wasn't even pork broth to begin with! Gah! And if they didn't like the server who took their orders why pluralize servers? They also complain that ""servers pressure you to order when you have a lot of questions""...excuse me, I never pressure anyone to order if they have a lot of questions, and when I answered the question from the girl, I never pressured her to order either, since after she said ""hmm ok"" in response to my answer, I walked away to let her peruse the menu a bit longer.I'm sorry but us telling you that we only have pork broth and not any other type of broth for our ramen does not mean we are ""rude"" and ""unhelpful""",TalesFromYourServer

"Setting: Saturday morning brunch, about 11 am, so we're in the thick of it. We're down a server so everyone has large sections. 

Characters: grumpy me, husband and wife.

Disclaimer: on Mobile

As I was passing by a table of mine and the husband points at his mostly empty cup of coffee.

I'm immediately put off by the lack of words used to communicate and pipe up with, ""Oh, would you like some more coffee? I'll be right back with that!"" Using my signature server's smile to feign my lack of enthusiasm. 

I grab a carafe, notice it feels pretty light, and go to fill it up. As its filling I vent (read: complain) to the nearest sympathetic ears about this table who couldn't even manage to speak.
After filling the carafe up, I head out to fill his cup! 

His wife is making constant eye-contact while I fill her husband's coffee. I wait for her to finish chewing and lean in to hear her better as she was quiet soft spoken when I took her order.

In a faint voice she tells me, ""You have a wonderful personality. Don't EVER change who you are."" And she smiles at me.

Y'all. I just melted. Like, just, ugh.

"Not many things shock me in this business anymore but this was a new one to me.  Last minute party of 18 with no reservation calls in and tells us they are going to be there in 20 minutes.  Not a problem it was around 3:00 and we can have them in and out before the dinner rush. We get a table ready for them and they come in and sit. 
Bunch of kids with them who are not well behaved for a place like mine, but it's pretty dead so I'm not fighting it. 
They aren't bad, but they don't sit in one spot at all when we are trying to get orders and we have no idea who's kid belongs to who. This table REALLY isn't helping us in that department, the 40 year old women are more interested in the wine list and 50 year old men more interested in telling stupid off colour stories to each other and laughing too loud.  All of a sudden a lady was yelling at one of my servers so I go to intercept.  She turns on me like a mongoose seeing a bbq sauce marinated snake.  I don't even know what she said but it was loud and screechy.  I tell her right away that I am not going to have a conversation with her if she is screaming at me.  Her reply to that?  (W)erid woman (40ish hetro white woman with no visible disabilities) ""ARE YOU DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ME?""  (M)e ""What?... what are you talking about?"" 
(W) ""I HAVE A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION THAT MAKES ME YELL WHEN I AM UPSET!  HOW DARE YOU DISCRIMINATE ME!""


How do you answer that?  I was not prepared.  The best I came back with is ""I need to know what the issue is so that we can fix what is upsetting you"" (or something very similar to that effect)  (W) ""WE NEED MORE WAITRESSES!  THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG TO ORDER""  (M) ""Ma'am you have only been in the restaurant for 10 minutes and clearly there are some of your party who are not ready to order yet"" (none of the men have even opened a menu yet, but they all have drinks) (W) ""WE'RE READY TO ORDER!!!"" and she is now spitting in my face she is so angry.  The entire party and kids running around have stopped everything and are staring at us.  The lady is close to tears and murder is in her eyes.  (M) ""I'm happy to take your order, if we get the kids to sit down we can take it right away, I'm really sorry there has been a delay"".  Now she looks pissed that I'm not fighting her.  (W) now in a growl whisper ""You will be hearing more about this... you can't treat people this way!""  I kind of shrug apologetically and gesture to her seat and the server standing right there waiting to take her order.  She sits down and another lady puts a hand on her and says quietly like ""It's ok Marcy, what's bothering you?"" one of the guys from across the table gives me a look and some hand gestures like ""we know buddy, it's alright, you did nothing wrong"".   It was a full 20 more minutes before anyone was ready to order.  She paid 5 cents below what her bill was... the other families tipped great.""Are you DISCRIMINATING against ME FOR YELLING!""",TalesFromYourServer
"I recently was promoted to bartender... but this was after 6-7 months of them telling me I was moving up and me getting pissed at them for not moving me up and very back and forth. Anyways  I moved up finally. 

Except I’m not scheduled any shifts next week. Just server shifts. They told me it was going to take a while for me to get real shifts and I was mostly just pick up and a back up bartender. Well I tried picking up a shift and it still hasn’t been approved. 

Recently I got some news from a manager that he’s moving to a different place as a GM and I would always have a spot there (as a server). The place he is going to is seasonal but I would be making $$$ during the season. 

I’m super conflicted because if I go there I cannot be hired back at my current place. I also worked really hard to be moved up but now it seems like I just got moved up because they fucked up and couldn’t keep their promise to me  and they just want me to shut up.

Also... a mass amount of people are about to leave so there is a chance I could take some bar shifts but there’s also a chance they’ll need me as a server. Also we’re gonna get fucked and be unstaffed with the worst managers ever.

There’s just so many factors and I’m scared to make a decision. Opinions?A Clusterfuck of a Situation",TalesFromYourServer
"   Just a shitty night. When I came in there was a table taking up both the 4 tops in my section and a 2 top, so I only had two 2 tops and one four top in my section. The bartender had them and said they were an awful party, and about 39 minutes after I got there they closed out their four beers and said they were going to wait for the rest of their party before they order. The bartender offered them to me, but since she had just told me how awful they were I said no it's fine. 
   They stayed the entire night, they were there at least until I left. None of the other servers let me have a four top in their section, so I got four tables the entire day and made $35. This is in addition to me going to college almost full time (I'm one class short), having a project due tomorrow, an exam I need to study for with my textbook that still hasn't arrived, and a shit show of a family life.

Her sweetness and bombardment of questions only a 4 year old asks picked me up out of my mood.

"I work – sorry, *worked* – at a casual upscale restaurant in British Columbia. I was there for a year. I mention BC because employees get great support from the provincial Employment Standards Act (ESA). An employee must be written up three times before there can be a serious threat of termination. The write-up has to be co-signed for it to count. In December, for example, I showed up to work 30 minutes late. It was completely unlike me, and after the shift I signed a write-up. No problem. It was my only documented transgression while working there.

I feel like now is the right time to tell you guys that 2019 was not kind to me. I was attacked and robbed mid-year (court case ongoing) and have been attending two kinds of therapy for my PTSD, and my beloved mother passed near the end of the year from terminal cancer. Her diagnosis came about a month after I was attacked. I tell you this for context, not for sympathy – nobody at my work even remotely knew about what I was going through. I kept everything completely compartmentalized. What I’m trying to say is, my professionalism was not affected.

Anyway, with the arrival of 2020, management decided to really tighten the reins. They were cracking down on everything. With all that going on, my GM and I decided I should take January off (mom’s birthday would have been mid-January). Upon my return, I was inexplicably held to an extremely intensive standard. Turns out giving me that time off put the restaurant through a little strain… ok, not my fault, I was told it was totally fine and even preferable for me to take the vacation. 

My first Monday back was the first snow day in Vancouver where transit was actually running. I arrived at work 4 minutes late, but was the second person in the building after the bartender. My first and second days back, I performed well enough to get decent tips, but management “could tell I was stressed,” so they put me on probation – a conversation for which there was NO record and no co-signage. Furthermore, according to the ESA I mentioned earlier… you can’t just randomly put an employee with only one write-up on probation. At the end of the meeting my GM said “See you Saturday” because that was my usual schedule – Monday, Tuesday, Saturday. Unfortunately, a new manager had been hired in to do scheduling and gave me shift outside my availability, which I missed.

A head office manager calls me on Friday, and when he realizes I didn’t know I was scheduled (again, outside my usual schedule) he says “Don’t worry about it my friend, if your boss needs you she’ll call you in.” 

Here’s where shit goes down. GM calls. I say, “I was called off by an HO manager.” She hangs up on me. I figure out a ride to work and text her that I can be there in 15. She tells me no, just come in for a meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow comes, and I tell her I am having severe anxiety and wish she would call or text so I understood what I was walking into in order to help manage my anxiety and… I get this text.

“Your final paycheck is in the mail. No severance.”

No explanation, no legal justification, and apparently, no severance pay.

I ask to be contacted so the terms of my firing can be properly explained to me. One of the top dogs, a man we’ll call Kevin, calls me a few days later. He says:

“You are an employee, not our emotional responsibility. We don’t care if you signed the warning – if the GM says she spoke to you and there’s no record, it still goes on your file. If we terminate another employee for missing shifts 7 times in 2 months, that has nothing to do with you because that’s our discretion. Speaking about it is actually a breach of the other person’s ‘employee confidentiality’. Look, I’m sorry your mom died and you were assaulted, etc., but that’s not our problem. Take a look in the mirror and take responsibility for your trauma. Our only duty to you is to pay you, if you show.”

As you can tell, Kevin is lovely. I’ve filed with the government and will be demanding severance for wrongful termination. I’ll keep you guys updated.

EDIT: I realized I forgot to address Kevin's statement about my coworker missing 7 shifts, and the unclear wording of that portion of my tale. Allow me to explain. My coworker missed 7 shifts in 2 months with the weak excuse ""my dog is sick."" She was given pass after pass after pass, until they finally started writing her up for her inability to show up to work. 6 days before I was put on ""probation"", this other girl was finally fired. The ESA says that employees must be held to the same standard. Obviously, this is so that everyone understands the terms of employment and what behaviours are acceptable and which ones are grounds for termination. The fact that she was allowed to completely just NOT show up for work 6 times and not be terminated is a completely different standard than the one I was held to. When Kevin mentioned this in his statement to mesh used the excuse ""employee confidentiality"" as a way to cover his ass for inconsistent and unfair treatment of employees. Sorry that I didn't include this originally, I hope this clarifies things. 

If anyone is interested, find information on BC's ESA here. https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/terminationFired with no severance? Ok, but don't be surprised when I come get what's mine.",TalesFromYourServer

We usually have 7 severs on the weekends and 1 busser on sundays. If there is no busser then the dirty tables will go untouched for AT LEAST 15 min. We're a small/med sized restaurant with only 40 tables so it shouldn't be that hard to clean? I really like the servers that work here but some of them are extremly rude and entitled. i'll be cleaning a table from their section and they'll walk up to be and grab the check/tip and leave... i feel like they look down on me because i'm one of the few highschoolers working there. It gets so out of hand that i have to start cleaning them just to seat the customers because there are no open tables available. While taking care of the customers walking in i'm cleaning the tables for the whole restaurant, taking Grubhub, UberEats, and takeout orders, running barista made drinks (the host stand is in the bar), and bagging up to-go orders.

i also work as a busser in the summertime because we get a lot of vacationers where i live. I get so discouraged when i get my tip-out... i did not work NONSTOP cleaning all the tables with no help for $35!

"This bitch ordered a dirty martini but it wasn't to her liking so I got her another one. Still wasn't to her taste so the bartender made another. Her friend looks at another table and asks me ""what drink is that over there?"" and I tell her what it is and if she'd like to order one herself. She says yes and I have the bartender make her the mix drink. Then, after drinking it a little, she claims that it has coconut in it and that she's allergic to it. I apologize (even tho it wasn't my fault) and go check the drink menu. The drink she ordered DOESN'T HAVE ANY COCONUT IN IT AT ALL. Only one drink has coconut in it and it wasn't hers. So I go back and show them the menu to say that their drink shouldn't actually have coconut in it but they both wildly exclaim that they can ""Definitely taste the coconut"" in it. So I give up. I ask my manager to take the drink off their tab, which he does. 

Next, I come to give them their tab and to my surprise, their drink cup is empty and there's a bunch of liquid on the ground. She gives me this attitude, points at the ground, says ""I spilled it"" and looks away from me like she's the fucking queen of whateverthefuckland. I dont say anything cuz I'm shocked. I've been a server for 3 years and whenever customers spill something, they're almost always apologetic and slightly embarrassed. But she wasn't. And after I didn't say anything, she points at the empty glass and says ""Look, you can see the coconut on the glass."" I'm *always* nice to customers, even when I shouldn't be (my coworkers tell me all the time) but since today was my last day and she's the worst customer I've ever gotten, I straight up calmly asked her ""Did you spell it on purpose?""

She spilled ALL her drink onto the floor next to a hot grill where me or the chef could slip next to. Plus, how could she completely spill ALL the liquid out onto the floor? And yes, it's possible she just had a BIG ACCIDENT with the drink she didn't want anymore, but judging from her attitude when she told me she spilled it, she definitely did it on purpose and wanted to give us a hard time.

For the love of all things holy, why did you give your son a crumbly chocolate chip cookie thing to eat? Why did you break it up and serve it to him directly on the table, even when I offered you a plate? You let him throw those crumbly cookie pieces onto the floor, then stepped on then so much that they got ground into the carpet.

There was food all over the floor within in a four foot radius of your large table, Some were giant chunks of cookie that wouldn’t have been hard for you to quickly pick up.

"So I worked a second job at a restaurant this past summer—one made famous by Tina Fey—to gain some extra cash and fill in days I normally would have been in school. We all know that servers can tend to have miserable jobs and miserable customers, but it’s the regulars that can make or break you. 

So I’ve got this one Karen (with the haircut and all) who calls every morning to figure out the soup de jour. Now the hostess swears that she keeps track of who had her last and rotates to give us as few encounters as possible, but I’m in 4 days a week and I see her 4 days a week. Nobody wanted her table, but I’d try and challenge myself to be extra nice to her and see if anything could be made of it. I always greeted her by name as she entered the building, had her coke, no ice made and ready by the time the hostess had her seated, and I knew her order by heart.

So every day I ask her how she’s doing and she replies, “hi, I’m here on my lunch break so you’ll have to make this quick, I’m ready to order now,” this could go one of two ways, she liked the soup, though it wasn’t the one she wanted (she kept holding out for a fall special that came once every October and would get quite annoyed when we didn’t supply it the rest of the year) so she’d get a soup/salad combo, aka, the cheapest item on our lunch menu. But, there were the days she didn’t like our soups. She made a very big deal about ordering a meatball sub and that she was having so much trouble finding something to order as we had no good soups that day.” Let me remind you, she called at opening, every day, to find out if we’d have a soup she liked, and she only ever ordered the same two meals.

Now, she also knew that it was the same person serving her because I had a bright green ombré hairdo at the time, (she thought it would have looked better if it were purple.) But she continued to act affronted as if she had no idea how to manage not having a soup she liked. Every day she’d leave a half-glass of her coke, no ice, (on which she’d specifically ask for a half-glass refill, we charge for lunchtime refills but not if we’re just topping off a drink to refresh it) and a $1.25 tip. 

Finally, one day, it happened. We had a soup she especially liked, and she wouldn’t be able to make it in for lunch the next day. She bought a to-go container of it, double the cost of her original meal, and almost double the tip.

"Over the summer I worked as a host at a restaurant that had a pretty high turn over rate. Their main issue was people quitting, and in my time at the restaurant I only ever heard of one person being fired, and boy is that a story.

So my usual shifts at the restaurant were morning shifts with the odd evening thrown in there every once in a while. This story begins during a particularly slow evening shift. Very little activity at all in the restaurant. Due to this, I was standing at the pass talking with my co-worker and one of my managers when the phone rings.

Me: Thank you for calling \[restaurant name\], how may I help you?

Fired Employee (FE): Is General Manager (GM) there?

Me: Sorry, you just missed him. He's gone for the night. You can leave a message if you want, I think he's in tomorrow morning. If it's urgent, Manager (M) is here.

She hangs up. I didn't think anything of it, just someone looking for our GM and was a little rude about it.

About an hour later, the phone rings again. I answer with the same greeting, and get the same question.

FE: Is GM there?

Me: No, sorry. He's gone home for the night. Would you like to leave a message?

FE: I called about an hour ago and was told he'd be back.

Now, one of my biggest pet peeves as a host (I still am at a different restaurant) is being called a liar. At this particular restaurant I've had my fair share of customers tell the managers that they had called in and that I had told them something but now they weren't getting it, and unless I wasn't sure about something (which I specified every time if I wasn't), I would never tell someone false information. So this kinda peeved me, but in the nicest way possible (sorta) I told her:

Me: Well actually, ma'am, I was the one you were speaking to an hour ago, and I did say that GM was gone home for the night. I offered you to leave a message as well, or you can speak to M if it's urgent.

She's silent for a moment before saying, ""Fine, I'll speak to M.""

I hand the phone over to M and go about my night.

The next day I was working a morning shift. GM was in, but was helping out in the kitchen as we were short staffed. He asked me to take a message for any calls for him and he'd get back to them when it wasn't so busy.

The phone rings, I answer with the greeting.

FE: Is GM there?

I recognize her voice.

Me: He's currently helping out in the kitchen and can't take any calls at the moment. Would you like to leave a message?

As she had the night before, she hung up at this. Whatever, I was over it. I went about my day.

Around the end of my shift a few hours later, the phone rings again. I answer. Yet again, it's FE.

FE: Is GM there?

Me: Sorry, he's busy at the moment. Can I take a message?

FE: When will he be free?

Me: I'm not sure. He's helping out in the kitchen, we're short staffed today. It's starting to slow down but I can't give you a definite time as to when he'll be free.

FE: I'll leave my phone number.

As I'm taking down her number she's slightly muffled, so I have to ask her to repeat a few times. When I read it back to her to make sure I had it right, apparently it was wrong and this bugged her because she literally yelled at me what the number was. I ask her for her name, she hangs up.

I go back to the pass and tell the GM he has a message and explained the situation from today and the night before. One of my co-workers was waiting on food and hears.

Co-worker: She's called like six times today. I answered the phone while you were doing room service runs and it was her like four times.

Me: She yelled at me for not being able to hear her telling me her phone number and refused to give a name.

GM: That must be FE.

He explains to us then the whole story: FE didn't show up for a few of her shifts on the previous schedule. No calls, texts, or emails before or after the fact to explain why she wasn't in, didn't answer any calls from the managers, nothing. So they took her remaining shifts off the schedule and didn't schedule her for the next rotation. This didn't sit well with her so she called the night before (the beginning of our shift rotations) to ask GM why she had been taken off. When I passed the phone to M, he explained it to her, telling her she was fired, and she actually refused to believe him, told him she'd only talk to GM about it.

In total, she called the restaurant 8 times in the run of 24 hours because she refused to accept that she was being held responsible for her actions, or I guess lack of actions, and that just baffled me. How do you tell a manager that you don't believe what he's saying just because he's not the GM?

I really wish I knew what happened with the whole situation. This was one of my last few shifts before I left, and I didn't hear any updates before I left. I hope they kept her fired, but judging by those phone calls she probably wasn't going to let that slide.Fired Employee refuses to be fired",TalesFromYourServer
"I'm thankfully no longer in this job but oh boy this customer was a doozy. 

Without fail she would complain about something every. Single. Day. According to her our service was terrible/slow/rude/whatever she was upset about that day - yet she was a regular and came in nearly every single day? Go figure.

This particular interaction was the first time I'd ever served her - before I knew what a royal bitch she was. For context, the cafe was small and when it was slower whoever was on would take orders, make coffee and run food/drinks (not really any designated areas as there weren't enough staff in slow times). It was counter service with the coffee machine next to the tills, so people would usually come to the coffee machine if something was wrong with their order. This day I took her order and made her coffee. She comes to the till and our exchange goes like this:

Me: Hi! How are you today?

Heinous bitch (HB): Give me a light cappucino

She's rude (whatever) but I have no idea what you mean by light. Do you mean skim milk? Do you mean more froth? 

Me: Sure. When you say lig -

HB: YES. A LIGHT cappucino. LIGHT.

Me: Okay so did you want it with -

HB: LIGHT. It's 4 dollars right? Here.

She gives me money and walks off and she's already in a huff so I just gamble on she wants skim milk bc that seems like the most plausible interpretation. NOPE. 

She came back a few minutes later screeching about how she said it 3 times, why can we never get her order right, how hard is it to make a coffee correctly (tbf it wasn't what she wanted but I TRIED TO ASK) and she's a regular how do we not know by now (this was my first time serving her). All I could get out of her was she wants it light. But as I tried to tell her I don't know what she means and I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. Anyway, luckily one of the long time staff members had come in by then and knew what she wanted. She wanted it weak. Could she honestly not have used the different word????

"I work as floor staff in a busy restaurant/bar. There’s around 10 floor staff and 3 managers in our section. A GM, assistant manager and supervisor. The assistant manager is a real asshole. Everyone in the building has consistent problems with him, he’s super condescending, rude and picks on people. He does not have good social skills and believes because he is the manager, everyone should listen to him no questions asked. He wants to be the boss but is a dick so people don’t listen to him, exasperating the situation. The GM and supervisor are really helpful good leaders so people listen to them, and they think the same about him but don’t want to deal with him or the problems he causes so it just goes on.

I tried talking to him a couple of times, cause I actually liked the guy at heart. I believe if there’s an issue you should talk about it with the person and see if you can move forward. It semi worked he was a little conscious of speaking to people in a less condescending way but went back to being horrible to work with. The last conversation we had made things worse though. He basically said that because I’m floor staff and part time I don’t care about my job as much as him, so only his opinion matters and that I pick on stuff he says because I don’t like him. That’s not true, most people talk shit about him behind his back the whole time, if I didn’t like/respect him I would just let that continue without letting him know there’s a problem. He basically said that I’m wrong he’s right and I’m the one that’s the problem because I’m rude to him (kinda true, I talk back to his bullshit a lot which some people don’t). I will admit I’m not the nicest to him, however he is the only person in the building I have consistent problems with, while absolutely everyone has a problem with him. He’s been on the warpath since, picking on people who he knows will take his shit more than I or others will. I.e. taking one girl aside to scream at her for eating behind the bar, even though 5 other people were eating on the floor at the time including the GM (he is constantly looking for stuff to pull her up on).

My question is, how do I proceed? I am thinking about filing a complaint against him, maybe requesting that he should do a leader skills training program or something. Has anyone had a similar problem? Or filed a complaint against a manager? I feel like it’s kind of petty but no one in the building likes working with him and he refuses to believe there’s a problem. Or maybe writing him a letter in a less argumentative way since our conversations haven’t gone so well.

"I’ve bartended for two years, been serving for almost six. Currently serving at the super popular Italian chain *wink wink* I’ve been there three and a half years. I’ve been the number one server there for the majority of my duration. This is a fact, not arguable. I’ve never had a guest complaint, my scores are astronomical comparatively, I get a dumb amount of guests that compliment me to managers or email the company. I have so many yelp reviews that yelp has started removing some because people don’t even mention the restaurant, they just rave about me.

I don’t want to move up to bartending or management there, but I’m young and I love the hustle and the benefits are great so what’s the move?

I posted recently about Valentines day and although there are days when customers really irk me, I love me some good customers.

I was recently pulled from work until after Wednesday (2/26). I initially was diagnosed with a progressing ear infection (meaning my ears looked slightly irritated due to fluid build up in the sinuses or whatever) and put on antibiotics (2/20). Friday the 21st, I worked and felt like I was dying. Two days later I tested positive Influenza A at urgent care. I get called in thursday the 27th, I haven't had a fever in 2 days and am feeling infinitely better. 

Typical server night ensues, one table left a whole ass mess, the rest were pretty tame. Then I got this glorious table. I see them walk in and they're standing at the podium waiting to be sat. I go up, ask how everyone is doing and one of the young girls pipes up ""Good evening!"" And I thought it was the cutest thing ever. The two kids were around 8 maybe 9 years old. Super polite and well mannered. We chatted about our favorite pizzas and some other stuff that honestly kinda left my brain the second I walked away. 

Anyways, I'm cashing them out and one of the moms tells me ""The girls are so sad they didnt bring their wallets, they wanted to chip in on the tip themselves."" One of the little girls even wrote me a little note, just a simple ""thank you!"" And drew a little kitty face covered in whiskers on the sheets we hand out to kids.

"Some quick backstory - I work at a server at a place that may or may not sell mainly large round things consumed frequently at Friday nights. But I'm not just serving there - servers take calls, seat people, cash people out, help run drive through, take orders, serve tables, buss tables, along with a few odd things done later on (clean bathrooms, restock, clean counters, etc).

I love this job. I love interacting with the kids that people bring in, seeing the odd orders people make, seeing whatever random dog someone brought in their car with them - it's great.

What's not so great are a few of my higher ups.

We have four managers, and one even higher up manager. Two of our regular managers are pretty chill, and our higher up manager is also great (he'll take tables if we get swamped, make drinks, seat people, take calls, etc.)

The other two managers, well, they're not my favorite people in the world.

On with the story!

Friday nights tend to be very busy - this was my second Friday night since Valentines day (which is a whole other story and beyond awful for my third day at work) but luckily, we didn't have too many tables the few hours I was working. Calls, however, were going off the hook.

First section we get in was a group of six - no big deal, biggest inconvenience was two people waiting on an order were sitting at our only 8 top.  Our third server wasn't there, and my section is that 8 top + booths only, so I seat them over at our newest server's section. Newest like, I was around the week before for her training. I got a mild scolding over how I turned the tables - it was apparently a fire hazard. I had done it before and nobody had said anything, but sure, easy fix. Fire safety things tend to be a bit odd, so other then a bit confused, I went with it. Made some small talk (apparently a slightly fatal error - I asked when her shift ended).

New server accidentally seats the next table in her section, again. Not a big deal, I just told her I'd take the table since her other was already a larger group. Well, manager was not pleased - she yelled at anybody who mixed sections, ever. (We have two table sections, and one booth section. Which means whoever gets the booths, almost always gets swamped while the two table sections might get 10 tables between them. So none of the servers mind dipping into each other's sections, or picking up tables if it gets too busy.) I told her I was worried about new server having both a larger table and that one as well, and manager told me she would help her out. Spoiler, she never did.

Phones still ringing like mad. Other server comes in. Everybody ends up with a couple tables, and new server did just fine.  Manager decides she needs to have me do everything under the sun, and keeps directing me at things that are anything but dealing with my tables. I even end up working drive through for a bit, which was certainly not my job for the night. Unfortunately, because of that, I forgot to put an order in (my bad), but luckily the couple was understanding. 

Eventually most people disperse to who knows where, after the call volume comes down. Manager two comes yelling from the back, saying anyone who doesn't start taking phone calls is going to get written up (she can only hear the ringing phones in the back, not see that every single available phone up front was being used most the hour). Phone goes off again, I'm working on getting stuff out to a table, and leave it for another coworker to get (who wasn't doing anything). Manager two yells at me for not taking calls, and that calls come first, and my tables can wait. I just kind of ignore it, and carry on.

Later on, I'm out (finally) working on clearing off one of my tables that left. At least one other person was behind the counter when I left, and I had my back turned to it. I was also a fair distance away from it. Manager two comes out and yells at me to get the phone. I answer back that I'm in the back (aka it would take me a moment, and if possible could she or another person take the call. Looking back, I could have said something else, but I also highly doubt she would have treated it any differently.). She leaves, I end up there a few moments later, and take the call. Not a clue where my coworkers had vanished to.

Only a couple ours into my shift, I get pulled aside by manger one, and reamed about my attitude. I'm being written up when I go into shift today for snapping at 3 different managers (including one that I had said maybe 3 sentences to, let alone snapped at). Told me all about how I need to work on my attitude, how I only make the manager's jobs harder, that I need to learn how to multitask and deal with how busy Friday nights were. That a lot of people apply there, and how lucky I was to have my job.

I was in near tears, and while she (very, very slowly) transferred my tables so I could clock out, she had me take customer phone calls. I think I managed to sound marginally okay, although I did have to dart off into the bathroom to cry a bit for a moment. 

I'd like to quit, and after I leave for the summer, I know I'm certainly not coming back in the fall like I had planned to.  There where a few things I could have done better, but I most certainly didn't deserve that.Probably In The Wrong, But Not *That* Wrong",TalesFromYourServer

"So I got secret shopped and I vividly remember him because he informed me he was taking food home for his wife and she had a black pepper allergy so nothing could touch pepper in the kitchen or she will get very ill.

So when he arrives, he had no menus on the table which indicates he sat himself (but in the report he said a hostess sat him but he “didn’t know her name”). Then I go to greet him and give him my intro and he was quick to cut me off . I then recommended some apps his wife could eat but when I went to the kitchen I was informed there was pepper so I went back and told him that I couldn’t do that one so I offered steamed veggies.

He agreed to the steamed veggies and I got it sent out first (in the report he mentions he was upset that steamed veggies came as an app). He then orders the most expensive item on our menu and I ensure there is no seasoning at all and he seemed fine. We had shift change so I had to transfer him to another server (who he also failed).

When I read the report he said NOTHING about his pepper allergy I had to work around and said I offered no appetizers when I went out of my way to offer some without pepper. He said I didn’t smile and said I didn’t greet him for 20 mins (which is not true). 

This whole experience is going to mess with me because I am about to get promoted into a management position and I feel it’s going to get ripped away. My managers haven’t mentioned it but I’m guessing we will discuss it tomorrow. 

I know I’m not a perfect server and I did forget to bring coasters so that was accurate but I’m not okay with a shopper blatantly lying on the report. What do I do?! I’m stressin’Shopper failed me and lied on shopper report. What do I do?",TalesFromYourServer

"So our hostess was off at this point, and the servers at our restaurant are obligated to seat guests when the hostess gets off. This isn’t a long Karen story, but still memorable.

So Karen walks in and she’s absolutely the typical Karen. White short hair, smelly flour perfume, the whole shebang. She walks up to me at the hostess desk and I’m like “How many in your party today?” She just huffs and says “I’ll go wait over there” 

30 mins pass and she’s sitting there watching me seat people, and usually I open with “How has your day been?” And go from there. I probably sit like 6 parties before her husband shows up.

When he shows up, I’m at the hostess desk again returning menus, and her husband sits down next to her and yells at me in a very thick Italian accent with his hands waving in the air, “Get over here now!” 

So I walk over, and she goes, “Sit us NOW! And don’t even ask how my day is going because you asked everyone else and it’s like you just press a button!” At this point I’m just thinking ok, Karen thinks I’m too nice, whatever. So I say “Right this way.” And take them to their seat. About half way there I ask “So, any other plans for tonight?” Ya know, like a nice starting conversation while I’m walking them to their table. Well Karen absolutely LOSES IT and starts screaming at me that she already told me specifically NOT to talk to her. So of course, like the nice person I am I definitely do not sit them in my section.

About 20 minuets pass and my coworker comes up to me and says, “The lady at 43 is just non stop complaining about you and talked to the manager because you asked her too many questions.” So I tell her and the manager what happened and we all had a good laugh over it.Karen doesn’t like that I’m nice",TalesFromYourServer

"Some years ago I worked for a company that specialized in Sushi and basic japanese food, it was a good job but a difficult one made so by the fact all the chefs, managers, and most of the servers were pretty terrible at their job; but they had all known each other for years and kept making excuses to cover one another.

Since I was ""the new guy"" I had the hardest job of all, working the hot food section. Our restaurant worked like a regular sushi place, all the cold food and sushi went on a belt that traveled slowly round all the tables, any hot food orders (and there were a lot of those) were sent to the kitchen i.e me.

I worked that section alone. Even on days when we being slammed and I had so many orders the delay on food was up to an hour long was I always alone, I was also expected to prepare all the sauces, clean the fryers, cook rice and cover the KP when he went on break, I was always alone, even when we had eight other chefs in the kitchen not one could be convinced to help me out, one would spend the day slicing up the fish the rest would be prepping sushi or standing on their phones. Management did not give a shit.

What management did care about was my performance. Reagrdless of how hard I worked it was never good enough and any customer complaints, regardless of context, were often excused as being my fault. The store manager, a read headed 'boss girl' type, would spend hours standing behind me, being over-critical of everything I did.

I worked 16 hour shifts from 6am till 9pm, often 6 days in a row. At 9pm someone else would come in, take over from me, the restaurant closed an hour later and they got the 'reward beer' they would give out at the end of busy shifts. 

 I had worked at a Fast Food place previously so I had been more willing just to put my head down and get on with the job in spite of the fact it was killing me.

I finally did complain several times, no-one cared. Finally after 2 months I became unwell and was disagnosed with muscle strain and fatigue. My Dr informed the restaurant I would have to work less, so they fired me.

The red headed 'boss girl' manager dragged me into the office to explain that not only was I utter hopeless at the three person job I was doing by myself for 16 hours a day for minimum wage, but a customer had complained about finding a hair in her food which had been identifed as being from my beard. Every other chef, cept for one, had long hair and a beard, but it was 'identifed' from my beard specifically, it sounded like bullshit to me, but I didn't complain.

They expected me to finish my 16 hour shift that day, instead I walked out. A few days later I was hired by their rival company across the street, who paid me more, treated me with more respect and I've found a large number of other people who have also previously worked at that sushi place and had the same experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in better sushi place I am 'in charge' of the Ramen section, I've won several in-house awards for my cooking and am generally considered to be one of the best at what I do. Outside of a small incident involing a vegan menu event I really love this job and had generally forgotten about previous sushi place. Until the day we started hiring new managers,

We needed new floor managers, the company had made the classic error of promoting good servers to floor manager levels and it hasn't worked. We need someone with experience and a few have applied.

Today is trial shift day for three of the promising applicants, the first one did very well, even noticed the few traps laid out by managerment to try and catch slackers, the second was nervious but did ok, but when the time for the third applicant comes in walks Red Headed 'boss girl' from previous job. She greets everyone, scans along the kitchen line at all the other chefs, then her eyes meet me. In my different coloured hat showing that I am at a sous chef level, with the several awards I have won pinned into the side. I give her a smile and a wave, she dead-pans stares at me for a lot longer than necessary before marching off to greet the manager.

Her trial ends in failure. Not only is she slow and unable to direct the staff; barking confusing orders and getting over-stressed at everything, she also cannot perform at a basic server level, cannot pour drinks and runs food like a clumsy 1st timer.  It was a privalage and an honor to hear the other servers complain non-stop about her inability and general agressive nature remembering how difficult she had made things for me at my previous job and the bullshit she had made up to get me fired. 

Her trail ended early, she was politely thanked, and we never saw her again. Manager came over to me after he heard I had previously worked under her and asked for an opinion. I gave him my honest one, told him of my time working at \*other\* sushi place and the fact I still have back problems from it, he nodded, trashed her résumé , and that was that.Is there anything more satisfying than seeing an ex-boss fail a trial shift?",TalesFromYourServer
"Tonight we were already slammed and understaffed when a group of 8 showed up at the bar. 

I usually memorize my orders, but they said they were getting eight drinks at once, so I said, ""Let me write this down so you get everything you need.""

A few of the guys ordered directly, but then the woman in their party told them she'd get their drinks. She gave me an order for seven cocktails, and I asked if that was all. I read back her order and asked if that was one drink for everyone in her party and she said yes. I took her card and saw it was a company card for a pretty big tech company in town and thought yay, always glad to have cool clientele. 

The bartender cranked out their drinks and I brought them over. When I went back to check on them, one of the men said, ""Is our other old fashioned coming?""

I looked at the woman, perplexed because she had clearly only ordered one. In the universal symbol for I fucked up please help, she widened her eyes and said , ""Yes right because I ordered two?""

And I realized she was probably out with her team and fucked up the order and didn't want to look like an asshole. 

So they left thinking we are a shitty bar, which we're not.

"So the new restaurant I'm at has an extremely strict ""take your break"" policy. Which shouldn't be an issue and actually something that I should be extremely happy about. 

Here's the thing. Even if we are extremely busy, line at the door, management will still make you take a break and leave the other servers to suffer. So instead of doing that, now they make us take a break an hour after our shift even starts. Yesterday I started at 9, and had to take a 30 minute at 10. I talked to the other servers about it and they just told me that they are super cheap with labor hours (surprise surprise) and they will take any opportunity to not have to pay you for something. The reason they make you do it so early is so they can get it over with so everyone can just work through the rest of the shift. 

I find myself just sitting and watching the other servers making money, and getting overwhelmed while I could still be out there helping and making money. I'm used to working my server shifts straight through without breaks because that's how It's always been at my other restaurants. Not saying it's a good thing, I'd welcome the break if they didn't do it in such a stupid way.

"So I worked at this breakfast franchise downtown over the summer. It was pretty disorganized but I worked with a friend and it could be fun. One Saturday morning ( busiest and hottest day of the Summer) during  the beginning of a 10 hour double, 4 girls walked in. They looked like trashy off brand Cardi Bs with attitude. One server had the section they sat in but he said he didn’t wanna serve them as they probably were the bad type. I said I’d take them since you can’t judge a book by its cover. I later came to regret that decision. I get them water and ask to take their order. 3 of them weren’t ready and told me to come back. The 4th one looked like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and ordered me to take her order. She wanted an appetizer of chicken wings. She said she wanted chicken wings and scowled when I didn’t know what that meant. I asked before putting in her order and told her we don’t do that since it comes prepackaged and ready to cook with a mix of flats and drums. Before I finished talking she immediately asks to talk to my manager (who told her the same thing) and I take drink orders. When I get back with drinks she demands to know where he food is. I never put the order in since she talked to the manager and assumed she didn’t want them anymore. She said if it’s not mostly flats, she’d send it back to the kitchen. She also demanded that they come out before the entrees( like duh, it’s an appetizer). She ate 2 plates and demanded they be free because they weren’t to her liking. The girls ordered their food and she requested a specialty drink which takes a while to make so I couldn’t put in everyone’s order plus I had other tables. She wasn’t happy about the 5 minute wait. When she got her food she threw it on the floor because « the broccoli was raw ». We steam out vegetables but she didn’t say she wanted it sautéed when I asked. She asked me if I was new because « I wasn’t very good at my job » and said that it wouldn’t be long before I was fired. I was really over her and her friends since they just let her be rude without telling her to chill. While dealing with her, I lost a table since I was to preoccupied with her bs to look at the tablet and they changed table sections. Still I smiled, got them their many rounds of drinks and tried to be as nice as I could even though I knew she was giving a tip at that point. They were there for over an hour so I was just waiting to leave their check. Everytime I passed their table, she looked irritated, even if I wasn’t greeting them and just getting other orders. When I was getting dishes from another table she called out and told me they wanted their check. I already had it ready in my pocket but my hands were full and no one else was ready. I collected the cups from there table and told her I’d be back with their checks. She instead decides to throw her money on top of the dirty dishes I’m holding and loudly says I’m not getting a tip so I need to bring back a receipt. I was so fucking mad but I had to keep the smile up. I had to get her cash out of a pile of spit out food in the Dish room. My manager said I should’ve just thrown it out with the food. After that , I returned with the actual check and she was mad because I handed her the wrong one (as if there’s not 3 others I had to give out) and asked for her change. My restaurant doesn’t keep a lot of change so we just round to the nearest dollar. I gave her the cash and she screamed at me over the 4 cents she was owed. I ran around looking for pennies and she continued to berate me. All together their bill was around 200$ and I made 9 dollars in tips from the other 3 so everyone kinda sucked. I was so fucking glad when they left. She’d also made a mess between the spilled food and her drink that I had to clean( low on bussers) but I was just relieved. My boss felt bad and gave me a free meal for dealing with them. I really hate people but I love the money.

"I work at a pretty busy restaurant and I have never in my life experience a kitchen that was so impossible to talk too. for example, anytime I ask for something simple on the the fly the chef says “ oh go fuck yourself you fucking asshole”: lare you kidding me right now? as if I am in control of the fact that somebody wants aioli and then the chef is such a grumpy old man that when it starts to even get a little bit busy, we are talking like five tickets in the window he starts yelling screaming and throwing things. he is the executive chef of an open concept kitchen, where guests can clearly hear him yelling.  a fine dining restaurant and this guy is screaming into the dining room profanities.

"
I work with an older man named ""Bob"". He's about 70 years old and definitely should be retired at this point. Our owner hired him because they're best friends for like, 40 something years, to a host position. Bob and I are the only two full time hosts. I absolutely hate him and so does the rest of the staff. He is sexist, petty, throws tantrums, and is completely unable to do his job. I spend almost all my shifts with him fixing his mistakes. He also can not be fired because he's the owners friend. Although I absolutely hate him for a multitude of reasons, too long to list in a single post, I'm going to post the most recent drama he's caused at work. 


At the very beginning of the day, before we open, the servers polish and stock any remaining silverware from the night before. Then, until close, the hosts are in charge of polishing and restocking the silverware for the servers. We also use a small supply we keep at the host stand to make individual roles of silverware for less formal tables. At the end of the day, after we close, any silverware left over is racked and cleaned by the servers. This is how it has been done at this restaurant for over a decade. No one has had any problems with this system. Until Bob. 


Please also note that the hosts keep silverware stocked at the actual host stand for the convenience of a certain sections so servers do not have to walk almost to the back of the restuarant to reset their tables


Bob decides that servers are no longer allowed to take silverware from the host stand because he has decided that would be for silverware roles only. He promptly tells all the servers this (which they ignore). He also proudly announced that he oh so graciously polished a rack of silverware for the servers, and had done them a huge favor. Bob absolutely knows this is part of our job description so I have no idea why he said this. Then, a server (R) kindly brings up a fully racked and cleaned supply of silverware for him to polish and put away. Bob freaks on him telling R to take it back to the kitchen because it's not his job to polish the rack, and he's already rolled enough silverware, therefore he didn't need more silverware. Bob also states it's not his job to supply silverware to the servers and told R to do it himself. 


R then asked Bob if he enjoyed being paid to do nothing, among other things. 


Bob went crying off to our GM (this man is 70+ remember) about being picked on and bullied by R, and how he's not going to polish the silverware, and basically stating he's not going to do his job. 


Now we have notices at literally every wait station and kitchen notice board explaining the system of cleaning silverware. R was not written up and everyone got a hearty laugh out of what he had said to Bob. Bob called out today claiming to be sick but we all know he's just sulking.

"I worked for a brewery/slightly upscale restaurant. It was late afternoon, just before AM-PM shift change. A slightly older couple, maybe late 40s-early 50s comes in. They sit in my section and go straight to the menu. I introduce myself, which they have little interest in. The husband order a coke and the wife a water. I grab the drinks, return and ask if they’re ready. They respond with “we’ve barely looked at the menu.” Annoying but not a problem considering it’s relatively slow. After about 5 minutes I return to the table to take an order. The wife asks me why we don’t have a tomato basil pasta dish on the menu that she saw online. I explained to her I know the dish she was describing but it has since been taken off our menu maybe 6 months prior. She went on to tell me how she recently became vegan and saw an article online about this dish and came there specifically for it.

Fun fact about this dish, the tomato basil sauce was made with cream, and it also was made with prosciutto, so not at all vegan. 

I told the woman, however, that I had good news for her. We were one of the only locations to have created a fully vegan menu and I would be more than happy to bring that and discuss her options. She was not happy about that answer. She insisted she came here for only that item and that the article she read said we would have it and she even saw a picture of what it looked like. I asked if she could show me the article so I could understand where she was coming from. She pulled out her phone and showed me. The first thing I noticed was the article was from 2 years prior (when the item first hit the old menu) and the 2nd was that the picture shown wasn’t even of our food. 

At this point I realize I should have tried to get my manager, but I’ll get to that in a second. I explained to her the article was outdated and the food shown wasn’t ours, but that seemed to infuriate her. She stood up and got in my face claiming I have been nothing but rude and dismissive of her and her husband and they would be leaving. I tried to apologize if I came off that way I was sorry but she said I didn’t mean it and demanded to see my manager, which I said I would grab him. I went looking in the office, the kitchen, the back bev station, the closed dining room, and the brewery, this man was nowhere to be found. The woman starts shouting for me asking where he is and I say I’m trying to find him, as I am rushing through the building. She storms out with his business card from the front, and my manager comes out from the employee bathroom, seemingly taking a very long and inconvenient dump. 

This woman writes in the next day saying how rude and unhelpful and arrogant I was when all she wanted was a simple dish she looked forward to trying. I re-explained everything to him, but he gave me a write up anyway saying I should have gotten him involved... I don’t know what could have been done differently. 

TL;DR: A woman wanted something we didn’t have, I tried to help her as much as I could, she wouldn’t accept my help, my manager was too busy pooping to get involved and then blamed me and wrote me up for the whole situation.I’m not sure what else I could have done",TalesFromYourServer

"Yesterday, we had a discussion about customers trying to get away with stealing food and being sneaky. We are a coffee shop/cafeteria inside a hospital. We have a self serve breakfast bar and people like to hide sausage patties under their scrambled eggs or hide hash browns on their breakfast sandwiches. You can’t make this shit up. 

So, we decided the best course of action was to put a sign at both cash registers, “You MUST open your box at the register.”  I literally had a customer laugh in my face and say, “You know, people wouldn’t feel the need to steal if y’all didn’t jack up the prices!”

That’s like saying, “Why make laws if I’m just going to break them?” I stared at her blankly and responded, “I’m pretty sure people stealing stuff is their OWN fault. Don’t be a sneaky jerk and we won’t have any problems!” 

And just today, my coworker asked a sassy regular to open her box and she looked right at her and said, “Fuck you!” To which my coworker replied with a shocked look on her face, “I don’t want to get written up for this, just open your box.” Sassy Regular said, “I’ll go somewhere else for lunch then, if that’s how it’s going to be!”

"Howdy Reddit! I wanted to share something that happened to me a few weekends ago and that I couldn't get out of my head because of how stupid it was.

For this story, it is important for you to know that there is a small foyer with a wardrobe at my workplace right before the main area where people sit and eat. The restaurant is mainly bottom-to-top windows, but the foyer is sectioned off by actual walls, so you can barely figure out what's going on in there if no one is actively looking. Oh, and we have a disclaimer written on a sign at the wardrobe that our restaurant is not liable for stolen items. See were this is going?

Cue a family of four a few weekends ago.  Mother, father, two sons, not necessarily friendly when we greet them but not obnoxious or rude either. Yet. They are seated at a nice window place close to my section, so I don't serve them, but can see what's going on and what they're doing. Not much of note happens during their stay, except that they are being increasingly rude and demanding to my colleague who's serving their table, without her having done anything wrong. On one occasion they complained about their food being too cold (even though it was still effing STEAMING), another time they call me over from my section all the way across the restaurant for another order of drinks because supposedly my colleague was ""ignoring"" them - I saw her come by the table to ask for refills literally two minutes earlier. We have these obnoxious types from time to time, and they are the worst, especially when the children take after their parents and behave the same disrespectful way. Some other minor things come up, the whole family gives us death stares for their entire stay and leaves no tip on a 60$ bill. They pack up their things and leave to hopefully never return to our restaurant. Except they do. One minute later. This is were I get to experience these people in all their glory.

The mother storms back in, through the foyer, the older son in tow. I worked the section next to the foyer, but it was quite a busy day so (naturally) I didn't have my eyes on the wardrobe all the time. 

Mother: Our umbrella is missing.

Me: Excuse me?

Mother: My son's umbrella is missing and I know someone stole it. I want you to take care of it immediately.

Me: I'm sorry someone took your son's umbrella, most likely someone else mistook it for their own. That happens from time to time. There is not much I can do about it at the moment. Maybe someone-

Mother: I don't care, we want the umbrella back. It was your responsibility to keep an eye on it, so you need to fix this right now.

Me: Again, I'm sorry, but our restaurant is not liable for the wardrobe and there is a big sign that states the same right at the entrance of the foyer. Sometimes things get mixed up and people bring in items they accidentally took with them a few days later. The same could have happened with your umbrella. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few tables to tend to. You are more than welcome to check if someone brought back your umbrella in a day or two.

Mother (muttering to her son): Yeah whatever..

I race back to my tables because I've been held up for way too long. Take a few orders, bring out some drinks and so on and forth to people, when I notice that the mother is still standing at the entrance after five minutes , brooding. So I head back, because quite frankly, she's blocking the entrance and I just want the have her out of my face at this point. 

Me: Excuse me, but is there anything else I can you with? Because if not, then-

Mother: I'm taking another umbrella. 

Me: Uuuuh.. What? (my genuine reaction) 

Mother: Since my son's umbrella was stolen I'm going to take another one with me. He can't go to school without it. 

Me: Madam, you can't do that. 

Mother: Oh, I can. We came here with an umbrella and we are leaving with an umbrella. 

She then hands me an umbrella out of nowhere and gives me a demanding stare. 

Mother: Go ask your guests if this is their's. If nobody says yes, we are taking it. 

Me: You want me to ask every. single. table. in the restaurant if that is their umbrella? 

Mother: I don't see why that's a problem. 

Me: Your umbrella was stolen and you want me assist you in stealing another one in return? That's hardly legal. 

Mother: I didn't say anything about stealing! This is compensation. And my son needs his umbrella! 

Me: Madam, I won't help you take someone else's property. I'm sorry you are missing an umbrella but there is nothing I can do for you. You are free to check in a few days if someone returned the umbrella, but besides that, nothing can be done. Have a nice weekend. 

She tries to protest, sees my manager approaching and just tells me ""you can bet I will be back on Monday"". With her son in tow, who starts to throw a fit about his umbrella while they leave, I check that they don't help themselves at wardrobe with yet another umbrella, and return the one umbrella she audaciously demand as ""compensation"". I share the story with my manager, we have a good laugh and wonder if that woman will ever return. 

She did not come back for her umbrella, but an umbrella looking suspiciously similar to the one she tried to steal was returned to us on Thursday the week after. I wonder who could possibly miss it.

"I am 40. I've been serving/managing in my family's restaurants since I was 12. My Dad retired in June and I decided I wanted to move on as well. My experience and love for the industry keeps me serving. I'm good at what I do and I make great money. 

I found a job at one of the only other restaurants in the area. It's a little bar and grill. We have a small staff. We have 7 servers and 2 full-time bartenders. I bartend one day a week. I am the oldest by far. The others average out to the age of 24. The owner is going through a long and bitter divorce. He stays in his office most of the time. He doesn't really pay attention.  These two factors probably play into the issue of the level of service the other servers are giving. 

I have a lot of regulars that come in three, four and five nights a week. They have told me that they want me to serve them when they come in. For example, I was bartending on Monday night for the first time. I was getting the regulars more beer and they weren't at the bar. We weren't busy and there was no excuse for the two servers. They're just lazy and inattentive. I had two regulars last night ask me if I am working tonight. I told them I am and they want me to wait on them because they can't get refills on something as basic as Coke. 

The manager in me knows what to do but I am not manager at this place. I don't want to overstep my bounds. I also know the owner should get his act together and run his restaurant and ensure customers are pleased. 

We take turns as servers. Should I just let the other servers take their turn and just take care of the regulars anyway? I have done this so much and I am tired of missing the tip when I do 75% of the ""work"". Should I tell the regulars they need to request me? I don't want them to feel awkward doing that.

"Serious question, if that's allowed. I've been serving for about 6 years and more recently have had a job at a higher end restaurant in my downtown area where there are quite a few homeless people living. 

A guy walked in yesterday and was sat by my manager, he had a huge backpack and to me, without negative judgment, he appeared homeless. He was courteous to me the whole time. I never treat anybody differently when serving them because I've found that people surprise you going both ways based on their looks. Anyways, he orders, he eats, he walks out. My manager followed him outside, but he was gone, I'm not sure what they would have done if they had found him.

I feel bad and think he probably doesn't enjoy walking in to a place and not paying, but he also needs to eat. There are shelters and places all around downtown where they have food for free, if he had even asked for food or said he couldn't pay, we have tons of employee meal I would have given to him. I don't want to insult anyone by asking, ""can you pay for this?"" at the beginning, but if they can't, then maybe we can move forward and they can still get a meal without stealing from a business.

What would everyone else do in this situation? I don't have to pay for any walk outs at this job, so no loss to me other than my time. I suppose the answer is going to be it's not my job, but my managers to decide on these things. But I don't know, it left a weird feeling for me.Question: homeless dine and dash",TalesFromYourServer

"Hi there! So I've been working as a barista for the last 6 months and absolutely love it, especially the dealing with customers (and getting tips) parts. Problem is, the money is just not there, and I want to move on to a place where I can really take advantage of my social skills and get bigger tips, rather than just get a portion of the tip pool (and people don't tip all that much at a coffee shop anyways).

Is there a best time of year to make that move? A sweet spot around when patios/terraces open for the summer but students are in finals and haven't scooped all the jobs yet. I'm in Montreal so all the patios are closed for the winter. Besides the money, my current job is really nice, I love my boss and coworkers. On the one hand it feels like the kind of jobs I'm looking for are starting to pop up now, but maybe I feel that way because I am looking more often now. On the other hand, if I could choose, I'd like to stay in the same spot until April, which would put me in a better financial situation to make a move, and would also be when students are in exams.

"To my thinking, your birthday is important to you and your loved ones. It makes total sense to treat a friend or family member to a meal or drinks to celebrate his or her birthday. I can't understand why bars and restaurants are supposedly on the hook to distribute free products. What irks me is the expectation that once you announce you're celebrating a birthday, it's incumbent on a business to give you things. The announcement that you're celebrating a birthday is 100% just letting your server or bartender know that he or she is now required to respond with an offer of free stuff. ""It's my daughter's birthday. Do you *do anything* for birthdays?"" asked in that whiney passive aggressive tone.

"Twice in the past week I have had tables that have been reserved for a specific time, turn up 45 minutes before they'd booked. If that wasn't bad enough these people have complained about lack of seating and how their table isn't ready? 

One couple who were part of a larger party had turned up 50 minutes early and sat at a table in the restaurant. When I asked them to please move to the bar area, they said it was full and that they would have no where to sit. In my head I thought you should have considered that before turning up so early? But instead I told them that unfortunately there was nothing I could do as the table was reserved within the next half an hour. They tried to say that that was loads of time for them to sit there. The LOOK on their faces when I said ""But this table may also turn up early like you have"" was priceless. Yes they were pissed off but I couldn't help but smile as I walked away.

Firstly they did not acknowledge us as the host/owner/server at all! Walked passed us 3 times without acknowledging our existence, no eye contact, no acknowledgment of our greeting.

They sat, my husband walked towards them with menus and they proceeded to get up and walk right past him, he literally had to step aside to let them pass, again no acknowledgment of his existence. 

They then walked into our other room which was set up for a group which had pre-reserved and pre-ordered, and then asked if they could sit in there. We explained that I would just have to move a table around for them and they promptly sat on the group table, set for 20!

We explained that this was exactly the table which was reserved, eye-roll followed. There was a reserved sign on it. I moved some furniture around and put their table together, they reluctantly moved over to this table. They have still not said hello or made any eye contact.

When I was a server I never apologized for something that wasn’t my fault. Even when working in upscale restaurants. I found that apologizing too too much can often bring out the “ Karen’s” and the “power trippers.” And I found it really didn’t affect my tips not apologizing so often. If the kitchen messed up I would say “the chef sends his apologies“ and if I forgot something or made an error I would apologize. But if it wasn’t my fault I would just tell the guest that I understood their concern and I would  share with them what was being done to fix it. If nothing could be done I would ask them if they would like me to bring the attention of management. Has anybody else tried this?Thoughts on apologizing to guests?,TalesFromYourServer

He was really inspired by all the comments and messages from the post once I shared it with him and says that while all the attention made him uncomfortable at first, that when things were getting really hard or the road seemed too long and he was considering quitting, revisiting the supportive comments helped him continue to believe in himself.

"Sorry, was too lazy to post for a while. Anyways, on with the show.

The setting is summer time, hottest day of the year so far, hottest time of the day in the early afternoon. I distinctly remember it being Father's Day. It's 40 degrees out, no one wants to be outside in the blazing sun. Except for one pair: a man and his grown daughter.

I'm the only server on at this point. I give them menus, get drinks and water going for them right away. All seems well at first; they're friendly. 

Finally, it's time to order. The daughter orders a fish dish, the father orders a steak dish (if you'll recall, I work at a popular steakhouse) and asks for it chicago medium rare. I attempt to give the gentleman our standard warning: when the bright sun is out, it affects the colours of the steaks. What looks red/pink inside doesn't actually look red/pink outside. 

He interrupts me and tells me not to worry about it, he's grilled many steaks outside in his backyard, he's well aware of how steaks look outside. I say great, but I still remind him he should just taste his steak before getting concerned. At this point, I'm feeling confident that all will go well.

Finally, their mains come out. After a couple of minutes, I go out to check on them. The father immediately tells me the steak is overcooked \[insert mental facepalm\]. I attempt to remind him about the sunlight and he interrupts me: ""I cook steaks all the time. I know what they're supposed to look like. This is not medium rare."" I then ask him to maybe try a bit of it first and if it's still not to his satisfaction, I'd get him another one. He refuses and says he KNOWS it's not medium rare.

So, I take his plate back inside. As soon as I cross the threshold, his steak immediately looks red-pink inside the doors. I know this steak is cooked just fine, but I go get my manager. She sees the same thing I do, but she can't/won't argue with him. So, she gets the chef to cook another one, but this time she has him do it chicago **blue rare to rare**.

She takes the dish back out to him and has him try it. He thinks it's perfect. For the rest of their dinner, he tells me -- in the most condescending tone imaginable -- that he knew his steak was cooked wrong, and THAT'S how a medium rare steak is supposed to be cooked (i.e., the almost blue rare one), and I shouldn't have questioned him. It took every ounce of willpower I had not to throttle him and then tell him the truth.

Yesterday, my coworker was talking about how he can’t whistle. I was telling him how I couldn’t wink as a kid but I would try so hard because my Grandma (RIP) used to wink at us all the time. It was a quirk of hers I still vividly remember (she died when I was 15 and I’m almost 32 now). 

A few hours later, I’m waiting on this older couple. The wife is short and round with white hair and kind eyes, much like my Grandma. The wife tells me up front she is hard of hearing (I work in a restaurant with an open kitchen so it’s quite loud) and I notice she is reading my lips. We get along well and they’re happy with their dessert. Husband pays in cash and I go to give them change and he says “no no we’re all set.” I cringe inside because it’s only two bucks on a $20+ bill, but it is restaurant week with a special menu that has great deals so I went into it expecting a lot of first timers who we’ll never see again. 

They sit and drink their tea and coffee for awhile after that, and as I’m going to run some other food, I happen to look up when they are getting up to leave and the wife makes eye contact with me, winks, and I go to bus their table and she’d left a few more bucks underneath her mug.

"I used to work at a place in downtown Austin, TX. We had a big patio out front with a pretty garden on the other side of the walk. Since it was a restaurant, we tried to keep any critters from living in the garden; we already had enough cleanup to deal with from the pigeons and grackles. We were mostly successful until a juvenile opossum moved in. He was pretty bold but relatively harmless, so we didn’t really hurry to find a solution to his living situation. At first, he mostly stayed hidden until after closing, so the owner put out a few traps and we hoped for the best. The little fella was too smart for that, and the traps remained empty. 

One morning while we had the doors propped open to receive a delivery, our breakfast server walked up to me and whispered that we had a customer in our gift shop who needed me. I followed her to the front room and there he was, little Mr. Opossum, checking out our selection of handmade local jewelry and crafts. We quietly shooed him out the door before any guests saw and we hoped that would be the end of it. 

The owner redoubled his trapping campaign that week, but again, the marauding marsupial was too smart to get caught. He knew he had it pretty good in our garden and he was making every effort to maintain his tenancy. 

Around this time, Mr. Opossum also decided that the patio that the humans were all sitting on wasn’t so scary after all. More than once during a dinner shift, servers spotted the little freeloader searching for dropped food among the tables or climbing the railings. Again, he would be quietly shooed away so our guests didn’t notice him. 

The next week during our big delivery, he wasn’t found in the gift shop, instead he bypassed it and went straight to the dining room. We knew he had to be stopped. He had gone too far.  But what to do? He’d eluded every trap we put out. We couldn’t poison him because who knows where his stinky carcass would end up? And we really didn’t want to kill him if we didn’t have to. Many of the staff had gotten attached to him and we didn’t want a full on mutiny over one eight inch marsupial. 

We had an entire manager meeting that focused on the possum problem, and by the end of it, I had convinced the owner that the catch and release plan I came up with could work. It would require the entire team’s cooperation, but I was certain my bleeding heart coworkers would be on board if it meant saving Mr. Opossum’s life. 

So, in our evening pre shift meetings that week, I reviewed the plan with the FOH staff. I coached the BOH staff as well, as they would be needed too. I bought extra brooms and staged them near the patio doors. And we waited each night for our little buddy to show himself until the night when one of the servers came running in from the patio to tell me the time had come. 

“Guys! You all know what to do! Commence Operation Opossum!”

The FOH dropped whatever they were doing, the kitchen spared who they could to assist, and my team of Opossum Wranglers all grabbed their brooms and proceeded to herd Mr. Opossum toward me as I waited with an empty bus tub. 

It was a tense few minutes. Mr. O. zigged! He zagged! He ran up a drain pipe and was turned back in the nick of time! He deftly climbed the baker’s rack we used as a server station and almost got away but at the last minute Alecia knocked him off right into the waiting bustub! 

Along with the staff, our customers who witnessed the incident broke out into applause as I secured the lid on the tub. (Thankfully our patrons were entertained and not grossed out!) I handed over my keys to the bartender with strict instructions not to burn the place down while I was gone, and I headed to my car with the tub. 

I drove Mr. O. to the lake that runs through downtown and released him near a stand of bushes I’d picked out days earlier as the best spot to give him a fighting chance. And thus ended a time that I will always remember fondly both for the compassion of the folks I worked with and the cuteness of the critter for whom we had to find a more suitable accommodation.

Two bottles of wine to share for the table and then I learned you were celebrating a bachelorette party. Everyone ordered an entree apiece and you were beyond easy to take care of, so I made a mocktail for the one girl that wasn’t 21 and brought out a dessert on the house for the bride-to-be. By the middle of it, you were all cracking jokes and referring to me by name. We were pretty slow and you were my only table, so I asked if you wanted more photos than just the ones I took at the table. We went outside, had a little shoot, and three of you gave me a hug and thanked me. 

Serving for so long has been getting to me, I base a lot of my self-worth off how much money I can make in a night. If people aren’t tipping 20% then obviously I’m doing something wrong. But one of your individual tickets was about $130 (alcohol is expensive) after added gratuity. And you tipped me enough to make it $200 and wrote the nicest note on the back of the customer copy thanking me and telling me how much it meant to them and joking that they will remember it for a long time (assuming they remember the night!)—which my sentimental self is going to keep for a long time.

Examples are, but not limited to these: failure to place an order into the system allowing it to then be late and therefore requiring \[owners\] to remove that from the bill will now be a full cost to the server. If a wrong order is entered and prepared that requires a new order made, that incorrect order will be a full cost to the server. If an extra cocktail, wine or beer is prepared it is the responsibility of that server to make aware to the bar tender that item(s) has been served. If a customer waits too long for service for drinks or food due to circumstances within their control, the cost of that lost revenue will be to the server. (ie: ignoring a table due to talking to another table too long, in the back eating, on your personal cell phone, talking with other staff members)

\[Owners\] have instituted a system that allows you to not make these mistakes, for example: The tickets coming from the front register, allows you the opportunity to review what has been entered and make any adjustments prior to fire. Further- Under the law, restaurants have the right to dock servers pay for mistakes such as described above including walk outs. However, we also know that docking the pay for these mistakes can not go below the federal minimum wage which we will calculate.

This is a fine dinning restaurant sourcing high end food which makes mistakes costly.""New policy at restaurant I work at docks pay for wrong orders.",TalesFromYourServer
"Howdy ya'll. I've posted before about the sushi counter I serve at. When I got this job I was really optimistic about it- the place seemed super chill and I got along well with managers and coworkers. So I'm very disappointed in how much of a shitshow it turned out to be.

During my first week, I noticed a few cockroaches  (should have been red flag #1). I was assured that these had come from another restaurant in the strip mall that had recently closed, and we're being dealt with. Months later, they are only getting worse. Customers are noticing, and another server told me they had been there for years. Last week I was sweeping behind a booth and a WHOLE ASS NEST of like 15 roaches came running out. 

This is a franchise based in Japan, and corporate has recently tried to improve profits by raising prices and making serious staffing cuts. They cut our dishwasher, leaving dishes to the cook and server. Since I am the only server with formal serving experience  (should have been red flag #2, but I figured everyone starts somewhere), I work alone on weekdays. I also host and bus, and there's never enough time to actually give good service. Our Google reviews are low, and every day there's a customer complaint about slow service, even though I'm busting my ass all day every day. I'm getting the feeling I was hired as ""damage control"", because none of the other servers are skilled or experienced enough to handle that many people. I'm being called in at least once a week on my day off because using me as a backup is better for the bottom line than actually scheduling enough people. When I do have another server on weekends, I'm constantly picking up the slack while they spend 20 minutes doing some unnecessary task in the back. We've raised our prices but are too cheap to order new menus. We also started charging for everything from to-go boxes to sauce to extra chopsticks. I am constantly being accused of lying about prices because management raises them without telling me. I've been staying an hour late every night to finish dishes, because everyone else just dips at our scheduled time off and leaves them for me. We have shared tips, so understaffing and apathetic coworkers mean I'm barely making half of what I was promised, but doing twice as much work.

Because of all of this, I decided to put in my notice. My manager seemed genuinely shocked. I explained to her that there are cockroaches everywhere, customers are upset, and the stress of everything being a constant emergency is bad for my mental and physical health. Her response? ""Well I guess I can't stop you, hope you change your mind."" Really?!? You aren't concerned about a bug infestation? About your reputation being trashed online because your policies make service terrible? That you can't keep qualified staff? I've never been so disappointed in management before. I might have stayed if they would have at least offered to work on any of these things, but now I can't wait to get out.

Thanks for reading this long ass vent post ya'll. I just needed to get it off my chest to people who understandI've never been so disappointed in management before.",TalesFromYourServer
"Hi guys, first time posting here but been lurking a while. Wanted to see if anyone had any advice for me here. 

I work at a pretty well known steakhouse as a server and it’s not a bad gig. I make decent money and I don’t have too many Karens so overall pretty solid shifts. I don’t work all that often (1-2 nights a weeks) and I’ve been working there for 2 years.

My problem is that every single time that I’m scheduled for a night shift, I have extreme anxiety for the entire day leading up to it. I don’t generally have anxiety and if I do I can usually keep it under wraps, but not so much in this case. I feel like it really affects me negatively as it makes me less willing to pick up shifts. 

Thank you for any advice in advance.Weird feeling before work",TalesFromYourServer
"  

So this is going to be a long one with a bit of backstory. Lets get into it.

I manage a cake shop/cafe, we specialise in ready-to-buy birthday cakes. We are a very small store, pretty much from every corner you can hear whats going on out the front. We also have a camera view of the entire shop front with a viewing screen out the back. So I saw and heard everything in the lead up to my encounter with the customer.

Just over a week ago on a Friday (a very busy day for us), a lady came into the store to buy a birthday cake for her son, should be a very normal situation. I don't usually pay attention to whats going on front of house, because that's what the service staff are for, I was busy out the back making custom cake orders for the weekend. But my ears perked when I hear her asking for discounts on the products in the display case (our display is always full of fresh cakes) the cake she ended up picking was only finished and ready for sale about an hour before she brought it. I had a bad feeling she was going to be a problem customer, so I was getting ready to go out to speak with her if needed, but she ended up happily getting the cake after being told the cakes were fresh and we had no discounted cake today by the service staff.

That's the end right? No.

About 3 hours later my co-worker ( Ill call him D from hear on) takes a call. I didn't hear both sides but D was explaining it to me as the conversation was going on, I was elbow deep in cheesecake so i didn't just grab the call myself

'So this lady is saying she brought a cake earlier today, after she got home she ate a sprinkle out of the box that fell off the cake and says its disgusting, she wants a full refund or a replacement cake because she thinks the sprinkles are stale.'

I tell D to ask her what it tastes like and to explain sprinkles are just condensed sugar a colouring (they don't taste great on their own) and the batch in question was delivered fresh to us just 2 days before.

She asks D to promise we will replace the cake.

He explains we cant promise that, but we would be happy to come up with a suitable solution for her if she could bring the cake and her receipt back into the store so we could understand what was going on. She screams at him over the phone, it couldn't understand what she was saying but I could hear the screaming coming from the phone. She hangs up before anything else could be said.

20 minutes late I see her enter the store with the cake box in hand (she will be called crazy cake b\*tch CCB, from hear on), D goes out to try to help CCB. He opens the cake to see CCB has jammed her own pirate decorations and candles in to the cake roughly. The tops destroyed, some of the frosting is squished onto the side of the box and the 'Happy Birthday' writing on top is damaged.

We have a pretty firm refund policy. Once a cake has left the store it can not be refunded for change of mind. And we are not meant to allow foreign objects into the bakery (her pirate decorations).

After going through CCB's complaints again, D offers to directly fix the problem, remove the sprinkle and replace them with a new layer of cream and chocolate flakes or different sprinkles of her choice, free of charge for her troubles. He also offers to fix the other damage she caused, free as well.

This is not good enough. CCB yells at him that its 'bullshit' and 'Its not good enough, the sprinkles taste like shit, I need a replacement cake or a full refund'

D says he needs to talk with the manager and asks for her receipt, she doesn't have it. D brings the cake back to show me.

CCB is angry and I want to deal with this as cleanly as possible, so I call the owner and ask for advice. The owner thinks the customer is shit talking to get freebies, but agrees it would be better to have this end cleanly, tells me to give CCB a half refund and offer to still fix the cake and give it back.

I take the cake back out to her and explain what I can do, I make sure i'm as kind and apologetic as possible

At this point she has been in the store for 7 minutes total, the store is also full of other customers.

She still complains its not good enough, and asks why I cant just give her a full refund AND a brand new cake.

I say ""I'm very sorry, it has left the store and has had object put into it so we cant take it back. The sprinkles are fresh and there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with it, I'm sorry you don't like them, we are more than happy to replace them and refund half the money for the trouble.""

The cake is on a little bench between us. Our conversation has lasted 22 seconds.

I see a look come over her face and she say under her breath ""Y'know what.."" and she grabs for the cake

I think 'Oh, she's gonna storm out'

Nope. CCB opens the box, lifts it open and brings it cake down on me at full force.

Just some perspective I'm a 5'6 medium build, mid twenties female. CCB is at least 6'1 and rather large.

I'm lucky that i'm quick enough to get my hands up to stop the cake so it doesn't come down on my head, but of course its a light sponge cake with cream, so it breaks up and showers all over me and the shop floor.

CCB immediately legs it out of the store. D comes from out the back, having seen it from the security camera screen and follows her to the parking lot. And takes a picture of her and her car. D says she tried to run him over getting out. Another customer also follows her and gets her licence plate as well.

I'm still standing there covered in cake, in front of a shop full of customers. I excuse myself out the back, take off the cake covered apron and hat, wash it off my arms and face then go out to apologise to the other customers in the store. and start cleaning the floor. The panic starts to settle in me and I start feeling a strained pain in my right arm where I took most of the force of the cake box hit. My brains still pretty foggy so I don't think to call police or security.

This is an insane story as it is but it just gets worse.

Not even half an hour later, i'm still cleaning cake from everywhere btw, D takes a phone call from our Regional manager, ill call him RM (its a Franchise, we are singularly owned but governed by a head office). RM is furious, and demands we will be giving CCB's husband a full refund, saying its now company policy that we give out refunds no matter what. D ask if he's heard the full story. RM says ""No, I don't care, give the damn refund, husband will be in to pick it up in 20 minutes"" Then hangs up. When D tells me I Immediately try to call back, no answer, so I call my store owner. Owner is pissed RM stepped in to do that, but tells us to comply for the moment because if she was violent before, we don't want to aggravate the husband.

I have no clue how they contacted RM so quickly, the only people with access to his number are employees, my best guess is she went to a store in the franchise and lied her way to getting them to call him.

Pretty much on the dot, the husband comes into the store, he's quite and takes the money from D, we get him to sign a from saying he's taken the money. Just as he's about to leave, he shouts back ""So this means you'll delete the picture?"" D says No husband repeats ""You'll be deleting the photos""

I walk out the front (stupidly I now realise) and say ""I wont, they're going straight to the police""

Husband looks me dead in the eye, points at me and says ""If you do, ill be back, and it wont be cake you'll be cleaning off the floor"".

I shout back as he's leaving ""Now I can add threats to my police report!"" stupid courage is apparently a symptom I get when scared.

I finished up everything I needed to and updated the owner and asked for her to download and send me the cctv. And I headed to the police station to make a report. No way am I letting them get away with treating people like this.

I made that initial report that day and was going to come back with the cctv the next day. But ohh it gets crazier! I get a message through our store Facebook from someone who knows CCB, including screenshots from the CCB's Facebook of her bragging about the entire incident, she goes as far as admitting to the assault and admitting to getting her husband to threaten physical harm if we went to the police.

So I took all of that to the police too! As well as going to the doctor to get my arm checked, he recorded elbow and triceps sprains, damage and swelling. Also got him to make a note of emotion stress and anxiety from the threats

The investigator thinks it will go to court for assault, but i'm still waiting to hear anymore from them.

I've barely slept this week, my arms getting better quickly, so that's good at least. I'm so paranoid everyday at work that they'll come back or find where I live. But I couldn't stay quite and let them get away with it.

Ill update if anything new happens. Its been really nice to get this off my chest and write it down. I would love to post the footage with this, but I'm worried it could effect the case.

Quick update:
I went back to the doctors, I have soft tissue damage  in my right arm from my elbow to my shoulder from where I put my arms up to defend myself. Ive also been pull on light antianxiety medication/sleeping pills to try and get some rest. 

Ive also been in contact with the police, apparently CCB and husband have been dodging calls and not answering the phone. They say cctv and the social media posts isnt enough for them to be charged with out the opportunity to give their side of the story. But if they dont answer soon a warrant will be put out for them and their car.

UPDATE: The woman has been caught up with and charged with assault. At the moment they dont think I'll need to appear in court, but that might change. I just have to write a report about what effect the even has had on my life.Customer assaults me after eating a single sprinkle off her cake, doesn't like it, damages the cake and demands a full refund.",TalesFromYourServer

"I've been working at a restaurant for a steady period of time now. I was lucky to be hired since I am not from this country and I had no experience in the food industry; I just needed a job. I was warned from the beginning from workers that were leaving that the boss has a tendency to build up resentment against workers for no legitimate reason and have it come to a head badly. Well, I think that's what's happening now.

At my last shift there were three of us: two on the floor, one behind the bar (me). It was quiet but then we blinked and every single table was full. We had just switched to a new cash register system that I personally found easier, but the waiters on the floor were still not used to it and were therefore very slow with putting in drink orders and food orders. Not only was I behind on drink orders because of just how many tables were ordering and how complicated some orders were, but the waiters on the floor took a very long time at the cash register while food orders were beginning to come down. I took some food orders out myself but in general when someone works the bar our goal is to make sure they don't leave the bar too often and I was already behind on drink orders and glass polishing.

The boss came down several times throughout my shift and was picking on me specifically. First he made a point of showing that I was neglecting to take down tickets because this was a minor detail, affected only me, and I had a million other things to do. Then he scolded me for keeping things like napkins and dirty food on finished plates I was sending up, which was never an issue before. One of the waiters and I were scrambling to clean up after the other waiter that was making more mistakes than either of us but we were getting the most flack for it regardless.

After work was done, he called me up and accused me of not caring about the job, of sitting around and doing nothing, of making the shift harder for the other two. He didn't give me a chance to even explain myself, saying that since I've been working this long and still can't be independent, he's going to be taking away some privileges. He did the same thing to the other waiter that was working harder but not to the waiter that was screwing us up the most.

I know this is the industry, but I'm very frustrated by the fact that he assumes the absolute worst of me and doesn't trust me enough to tell him what I think went wrong, especially since I was on the floor the entire time and witnessed everything. One of my coworkers warned me that he heard the boss talking about firing me but at this point I'm ready to quit. Since I'm new to this country I really need the money but I guess now that I have some experience I'd probably be better off working elsewhere.RANT: After a particularly bad shift, I was the scapegoat and might possibly lose my job.",TalesFromYourServer
"At least every 6 or so months, the owner of our restaurant adds about 6 or 7 new items to the menu in hopes to start making more money and bringing in new customers. BUT every time he does this he ends up taking these items off the menu no more than 3 weeks later, just cause he doesn’t want to anymore, or he thinks it’s costing him more money than it’s making him. Well, he just did it again, and just like all the other times he’s done it, we get complaints from customers. He comes in for about an hour once a week, that’s literally it, and it’s us who has to deal with the angry customers when he pulls this bullshit!!

"Hey guys, I have a dilemma and need advice. 

I work off the books at an Irish dive bar/restaurant. I’m a server. I get paid only $20 per shift w/o tips. I do this job because it’s the only place that would hire me and is around the corner from my house and kids school. So, if I need to pick up my kids it’s convenient. I can also take my kids to work if my husband is stuck at work, which happens a lot. 

This is my dilemma... The restaurant was shut down because this past Sunday the bartender/owners niece had her babies baptism party at the restaurant. Our boss told two other Waitresses to come in at 10am to decorate the entire restaurant. The girls worked from 10am-6pm, I came in at 1pm until 9:30pm and cleaned the party stuff afterwards. Me and the other two girls served (catering style) hors d’oeuvres from 1:30 until 2:30, set up the buffet at 3:30 set up for the dessert table at 4:30 and we served drinks to about 100-150 people from 12-6 supposedly at $35 a head. Some of the customers tipped us 3 girls and we pooled around $42 each. Our shift pay was $40 each, so we each left with $82 each not including the tip from the event. The next day each girl was left with just $100 each which was the tip from just the party. In your opinion is this a fair tip? I feel offended. Especially since it was a tip from a coworker, but I feel like I worked and made nothing. I don’t even like this girl and we aren’t friends enough for me to work for free for her.

"So this trio of upper-middle-aged Rich Housewives types came in one evening and proceeded to ask me to recommend an udon dish to them, so I tell them that we’re most known for our dipping udon. For those of you who don’t know what that is, basically the noodles are served separately from the soup, which in this case is now a thicker broth, and you literally just dip a chopstick-ful of noodles into the broth and consume.  They decide to get one (1) order of noodles to share with an entire table full of vegetable tempura. Okay. 

I bring out their noodles and take the liberty of preemptively giving them three dishes of toppings (they typically come on the side anyways) and three smaller bowls so they can split up the noodles however they want. One of them looks at me and asks: “Can you split this up for us?”

What. 

Turns out she wants me to split the broth into three bowls and the noodles into three bowls FOR THEM, oh and also bring them new topping dishes without the pork slices. 

I end up bringing everything to the back and start splitting up everything so I now I have six tiny bowls of noodles and broth on a tray, each with like two bites of noodles and three spoonfuls of soup, and three new topping dishes. I didn’t know if they just didn’t eat meat, or if they had a specific thing about pork, so I felt bad about just tossing out the pork slices and ended up asking the kitchen to make three new topping dishes in case it was like, a religious thing. 

I bring everything back out again and ask if there’s anything else I can help them with. One of the other ladies stares at her dish, looks up at me, and stares back at her dish. I ask if she had a question. 

“What is this?”

Um. They’re. They’re noodles. Like the pictures. On the menu. That you looked at. That I walked through with you. 

Turns out, as her friend explained, what she wanted to know was how to eat them. This is a normal question, one that we get often. Lots of people haven’t had dipping udon before. Why she didn’t just ask me that, I have no idea. 

They then leave after taking like two bites of everything, so we’re forced to trash most of a table of perfectly-good vegetable tempura.

"Tl;dr at the bottom. Thank you if you read all of this rant, it’s very cathartic for me. This was in Mobile, if there are issues with formatting I’ll fix it up on my computer in the morning.

Valentines is a very busy day for every restaurant. Young couples, old couples, people who want to have a time with just the two of them—-and when you have 7 groups of 2, tables full out really quickly and suddenly the entire store is filled and the servers are running around trying to manage it all.

A group of 6 came in on Valentine’s Day to the sushi place I work at. Backstory of the day: 1 chef (also my boss), 2 servers (including me), bathroom flooded earlier. Half the kitchen is a cm in water. So needless to say, it was stressful. This group of 6 came in and I explicitly warned them that the food was going to take a VERY long time. I work at a mom and pop sushi shop. The owners aren’t very keen on business, and we offer AYCE at 27.95 a pop. This means people tend to order HUNDREDS of dollars worth of food for 27.95 each.

In my opinion, if you’re having good food for 27:95, please quiet down and be patient. Because that’s what the MAJORITY of people do, especially groups. It takes forever to make all of those back-kitchen orders and those 26 piece AYCE nigiri sushi that you ordered.

This group of 6 was led by a she-ogre of a matriarch. I’d say we were working well. We were getting orders out as soon as we could and we literally could not control the speed of how they were being made as we had a full house in an establishment that never has more than 5 tables at a time. She was getting very rude, was talking at me instead of to me, was very demanding with her food. “We didn’t get served this!” Yes, you did, I’m pretty sure I know the menu and what you ordered at a place I’ve worked at for 8 months, on a sheet of paper that clearly marks what you want. “The orders are too long!” That’s because you and your family ordered 10 things from the back kitchen, around 30 pieces of nigiri (2pcs), and 7 fancy rolls. It’s gonna take a long time, love. In any case, I was very polite until the very end.

By the time they wanted to leave, the other server was giving them their check and informed them that we add a 18% gratuity on groups of 6. Groups tend to eat us out of our food and tip as though they didn’t just devour two large salmon imported from Scotland and five McDonald’s meals worth of sushi. A 50 dollar tip on 6 all you can eat orders is because we have to clean up the spill your spawn left on the floor, the beer s you leave on the table, your filthy food that’s stuck to the chairs and the table, we clean all of that. We have to touch that. We have to make up for your lack of manners by making it look like we didn’t have a dump truck leave organic waste on the table. It was bad. Like a farm animal’s trough, rice and soy sauce absolutely up the wazoo. So she was mad, “I’m not paying tip for this terrible service!”

Listen, Dear Mrs, our service was good. And honestly? The rolls didn’t even come out that late. We were PRIORITIZING the group and getting their orders out relatively quickly compared to other tables. We have ONE kitchen staff, and we made this clear BEFORE we sat them in case they wanted to change their mind. And, you’re expecting speedy service on VALENTINES day? Are you absolutely empty in the mind? I sigh and I’m exhausted. Two hours. I was solo for two hours because my co worker was mopping flooded floors nonstop. Two hours of nonstop rotations of customers. Apologizing, checking up, refilling drinks. Taking the food to the back, cleaning it. We ran out of plastic cups and had to use glass. It was a shitstorm.

She saw that I was very exhausted and she was angry and pissed and looking like a baboon’s ass. “Give me your name!”, and I refused. “I’m not comfortable. Why?” “So I can YELL at you!”

It stressed me out insanely. I was exhausted, I wanted to go home. “Please,” just, so tired and done with her childish tirade.

Don’t come to an AYCE sushi place with 6 people on Valentine’s Day; we quite literally don’t have the Roman Army it takes to please you at your every whim. Sorry. The world doesn’t work like that. “Please.”

In the end, she wrote “WORST SERVICE EVER!” As if I give a single shit. I’ve quit that job looking for something better. When things like this happen, it’s alright to feel angry and frustrated. It’s alright to feel dehumanized and disrespected. You’re not any lesser for having those feelings still. As you work and move on, your tolerance for bullshit builds up. This is just a rant. This whole exchange, between the store flooding, full time in college, food, and just life expenses, soured me for days and I still get stressed thinking about it. I was threatened to get screamed at for a singular sigh behind the waitress counter as I rung them up. $400 of food for $27.95. On Valentine’s Day. In a store full of couples, you bring your family and expect food within 15 minutes.

The childish entitlement of some of these people. Unbelievable.

Tl;dr: entitled matriarch brings her family of 6 to eat AYCE on a stressful Valentine’s Day. Expects 15 minute service on 30+ orders and gets mad about the “service”.

"All night I worked by myself as the only hostess. Every time I went to sit one table, three others at by themselves. The servers were overwhelmed. We had one busser. She was also overwhelmed. I was running around helping everyone and doing everything. One of my servers yelling at me to ""do my fucking job right."" By the 4rth hour of nonstop panic I had a panic attack. I was trying to control my breathing but there was nowhere to hide the despair on my face. You sat at the bar and saw it all. 

I found out later an hour before closing you were a table of seven, just didn't know who to talk to since I was running around like a madwoman. I apologized a million times, but instead of chewing me out, you said: ""it's okay, don't worry about it, we can wait."" I laughed in relief at finally being treated like a human. I told you I'd seat you as soon as I could. But you said, ""we're not in a rush, whenever you have room, We're okay here, and you're doing great."" 

By the end of the night, your party arrived and you told me ""we're just going to get a few drinks and get out of here, Don't worry about us. You did great."" I had tears in my eyes. I felt like I was drowning in so much I had to do I couldn't even start my closing side work because I was still seating people by the last 5 mins before 10 pm. 

I hope the dessert I sent to you at the end (out of pocket),  was enough to thank you for treating me like a human, and for telling me what I really needed to hear in that hour. 

PS. I've talked to my managers and I told them I refuse to work alone ever again, and if I work alone I will be walking out. A panic attack and almost a second one with nonstop running and mental stress are NOT worth 14 an hour.

Edit: the server was spoke to and he apologized to my today and i could tell it was sincere. All is good. My second hostess has been promised. Hopefully i wont wver have to deal with that again.

"Background: I used to work at a college bar with a separate ""game room"" with our pool table that we generally put larger parties in (seats about 40 but theres a ton of standing room and we have pop up tables). 

I was working a Sunday morning/afternoon shift by myself (I was bar and tables until about 2pm because it'd generally be slow). A man walked in just when we open at 11 and said he had a group following behind him. I showed him to the game room and asked what size his party would be. I get a shrug and ""not really sure"". So I ask for a rough estimate because I'm the only person serving front of house and we have one guy in the kitchen. He says maybe 40? 

It's not ideal in the very least. I let the guy in the kitchen know and pull all the tables together to seat 40. 

In walks 75 people. Parents and a bunch of dolled up kids headed to a dance competition no where near campus. I rush to put up more popup tables. Kids and parents all sit separately and everyone orders seperate entrees and everyones on seperare checks. I call my manager begging to get another person in the kitchen and someone else in front of house because my resturant is filling up too. No one answers. 

The guy in the kitchen ended up calling his brother in to the kitchen (he doesnt work for us but what do I care in the moment) and the food is coming out as fast as it can. I have parents complaining that they're almost finished eating but their kid doesnt have their food yet. I tell them we're working as fast as possible but we aren't a large staff and they didnt make a reservation. My main resturant tables are suffering and some people have (rightfully) walked out. 

When it's time for this party to pay parents are saying ""i have that blonde kid over there"" like that means anything. So I hand every adult and child their own check and tell the kids to give their tab to their parents. Parents are furious that I cant put their kids on their check. Theyre furious that I charged the 50 cents for ranch. They're furious I let the kids order extra fries. Theyre furious I'm not paying more attention to them and their problems. Most of them tip between 0%-5%.

"So I served a table of 10 and I immediately recognized one of the girls as someone I knew as a teenager. We were on a sports team together and she was very shy. Something about her really annoyed me and I was very cruel to her. I made fun of her with our other teammates and she was a bit isolated from everyone for a while and I think it definitely had something to do with the way I was with her. It was a very bad time in my life and I took my anger out on people around me and she was an easy target. 

I really am disgusted with my behaviour back then and I feel so horrible about it. I haven’t thought about that time in my life at all since then because I ended up developing PTSD from the trauma I experienced at that time so I have blocked a lot of those memories out. Her mom paid the bill for the table and tipped me nothing on $400. I feel like I got what I deserved and if she had tipped me I think I would have felt shitty about it. 

My friend said maybe I should reach out to her and tell her I’m sorry but I don’t think that’s necessarily the thing to do. I’ve had someone reach out to me that treated me poorly in high school and it really didn’t make me feel any better about the situation. It also just seemed like she was doing it to feel better about herself and I don’t want to come across like that. 

There’s also a small chance her mom is just the type of person to not tip. Everything with their meal was good and they were all very nice to me and thanked me a lot but the guilt ridden anxiety side of me feels it was definitely personal.

"This is a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but I’ve been in the service industry for almost 15 years now, and in that time I have only ever worked at places that serve Coke products. Restaurant, bar, catering company, sporting events, you name it: Coke.

Last year my current job made a huge switch and gave Pepsi pouring rights for the first time ever. And it’s not until you serve Pepsi that you realize that nearly 100% of people ask for Coke by default. Even people who actually prefer Pepsi. And because of this every time someone orders with me, I have to follow up with “is Pepsi OK?” Even with people who are there all the time. Even people who I have LITERALLY SERVED THAT NIGHT! Like they’ll ask for Coke, I’ll ask if Pepsi is OK, they’ll say yes and then come up and say “can I have more Coke?”

"Please bear with me. I am not a server, never been, I like reading in here since I eat a lot in restaurants and like to try out new places with my SO (I'm from Switzerland)

So, I get it, in the US you are paid minimum wage (a few dollars per hour), you make your money from the tips. I get that.

Here is the question that I asked myself many times. Even though I also was in the US many times for business and ate a lot in restaurants. Every time i tipped, this question popped in my head. 

Let's say I am in the US and eating out.
I order a Steak, a salad, vegetables and a bottle of wine - total 70$
So I am assumed to tip 7-15$ (i guess?)

So the next day I go to the same place again.
I order a Steak, with a salad and vegetables, but this time I choose a very expensive bottle of wine - total 150$
Now I am assumed to tip like 15-30$

But here is what I don't get.
The server has the same effort he needs to put in. Why am I supposed to tip according to the total amount of my meal, when most of the time, for a simple meal, the effort of the server is the same - regardless the price.
I read many times where servers rate the tip according to the total amount of their bill. 

I don't want to sound cocky or ignorant. I really would like to know. Is this cultural or is this because if someone eats expensive food he should afford to tip more?
Please note, I am not talking about the tip in general, I get it that. I would like to know the oppinion of the servers according to my sample.

P.S.:
Oh, and why some of the restaurants in the US value the customer so much and offers dicounts if they throw a fit (just to have something taken off the bill), is someting I don't understand neither. Makes me really feel bad for the servers over there. But this is a question for another time.


EDIT:
Alright, thank you for your insights. Now I got the idea. When life brings me again in the US, I will make sure to tip at least 20%Why is someone expected to tip according to the total of his bill?",TalesFromYourServer
"Okay so firstly I’m still kinda new to serving (been in restaurants for 3 years, but only been serving for 1) so I might have been able to handle this better. But it got me fuming.

I had a huge party yesterday, and they tipped and treated me like crap, and left with a few of their credit card slips so I had to 0 them out, so I was kinda burned out on parties today. Got sat a 12 that turned into a 16. That’s fine.

They’re at 3 different tables, 2 for adults and one big one for the ‘kids’ ranging from anywhere between it seemed 15-20. One of the adult tables tells me when I ask that their whole table will be on one ticket, and I say great. As I’m asking the kids who will be paying for them or who might be paying for themselves, one of them, maybe 19 or 20, says he’ll be with his mom, who’s sitting at the table that will all be on one check. I say great!

The service actually goes pretty smoothly, they’re polite, and understanding when the kitchen takes a minute because we got slammed. After desert, a few of them, including the mom and her son, get up and leave as I’m handing out the checks.

Lady from the table who’s all on one check comes up and says: hi, I’m sorry, but I didn’t order these chicken tenders.

Me: oh yes, one of the gentlemen from that table said that he was going to be part of your bill.

Lady: um well IM the one paying so you really should’ve asked me. Who was it?

Me: uhh... the kid in the black jacket? I’m pretty sure he just left.

Lady: well, you really should’ve asked me. I’m the one paying, I even told you that (she didn’t), this is unprofessional.

That table ended up stiffing me, and that entire table glared daggers in my direction until they all got up and left. The rest tipped okay, but not enough to make up for a stiff on a $70 tab.

I’m so done with big parties honestly. I’ll make sure to be asking who’s paying and confirming who’s on their ticket from now on. But honestly, if you can’t communicate with your party, I don’t think I should be the one getting yelled at at the server station. And with how quick the guy was to get up and leave, I kinda wonder if he knew that it wouldn’t go over well. He had seemed kinda dodgy when saying who’s check he’d be apart of earlier.If you can’t communicate with your party, it’s not my fault.",TalesFromYourServer
"I had to wait on a group at the beginning of my serving career who I still get nervous about seeing whenever they come in. Table was comprised of 2 parents and 4 teenagers. While I was taking orders the Dad (presumably) got a facetime call. I had already taken his order, I don't think it's rude if you take a call as long as you've already communicated your order to somebody. HOWEVER, the man turned his phone around to show me to whoever he was facetiming, it was the front camera and I could see his entire screen. Throughout their entire visit, I felt uncomfortable and kept seeing him pick up his phone in suspicious angles which made me feel like he was taking pictures/video of me. I was a pretty popular cam model a little over a year ago, and it made me feel like he recognized me from there and was showing me off. Obviously this is kinda self-absorbed to think, but WHY WOULD YOU TAKE PHOTOS/FACETIME OF YOUR WAITRESS!!! AT A NORMAL SPORTS BAR!! WITHOUT TELLING HER?????  The worst part is his wife didn't say A SINGLE THING to him and even got mad at him for overtipping me, when IMO if I'm gonna be your model for the night I should get paid extra.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; A guest repeatedly took pictures of me and facetimed to his friends what I looked like. Made me very very nervous as  I was a popular camgirl before this job and I have a constant fear of somebody recognizing me. Ever since this happened I've been paranoid it.

"I used to work at this place for about half a year and the number of infuriating stories has provided me  with great talking points at parties for the last year, so at least it got that going for it.  Pretty much everything about this place except my co-workers was a total shitshow. The place is a small Café and Icecream shop in a part of Berlin that is mostly inhabited by families, owned by an Electrician who has no goddamn clue about how to make food or coffee. I've worked as a barista before, and I really take pride in making the best coffee I possibly can. First day there I tried to make a Cappucino and pour some latte art, then proceeded to wipe the steam wand like always. I noticed that they used low fat milk which is shit for making good foam, and the dose of espresso was way to low, so it didn't have any crema and was super watery. I later suggested to the boss that 3.5 fat milk would be better and offered to take time after work to adjust the machine. He shot me down and said they've always done it like that. Well, pisspoor coffee it is then.   


Apart from the owners being shitty, the place was almost exclusively visited by Families, as we had a big Sandbox in the middle of the terrace, and the entire thing was marketed towards families with kids. You can bet your ass the parents took this as ""Guess I don't have to watch my crotchgoblins then!"". Nearly every time I tried to bring an order to a table some kid walked right into me and almost made me trip, but eh who cares.  Most customers were super rude, just ordered so they can sit and let their kids play. Tips were shit, and cleaning up at the end of the shift was always a nightmare. Dried up icecream and trash sticking to it coated basically the whole place since none of the parents had the decency to care for what they\`re kids did. Sometimes kids just took buckets of sand inside the Cafè and played there, which made the floor super slippery and I've slipped several times when I was the server, luckily never with a full tray.   
A few months after I stared working there, in the middle of summer, it was super full and the entire staff was beyond their breaking point, because of the shitty management there was no possible way to get out orders in time. One time a kid took a dump in the sandbox, which riddled the entire terrace with a stench that can hardly be put into words. The parents did nothing, even though they saw it. The kid then proceeded to go on the little slide we had, and covered it in shit too. Parent's did nothing. None of the staff members had time to deal with the situation, so I asked the boss to talk to the parents. He reluctantly did, and I heard them argue that kids do things like these and that its no big deal. He then came to me and told me that he would be taking over for me and that I should clean up the sandbox. Apart from the fact that this was bullshit, him taking over would just send of a cascade of pure chaos, since he didn't have a clue which tables already ordered, which ones payed, etc. At that point I was already so broken inside from customers yelling at me all day that I just took the shovel and the bucket and did it.  It was absolutely foul. No idea what that kid ate, but even I in my entire 22 years of like have not produced something so vile. When I was done I walked past the parents table, and instead of thanking me they informed me that they would like to get another water and a scoop of icecream for the little shitter, I told them boss is taking orders now, which they seemed to ignore.   
After I threw away the bucket and everything that touched it and cleaned my hands for what felt like an hour, I see boss having nothing under control, tickets are all over the place, my coworkers are arguing with him and finished orders are melting away on the bar because boss doesn't have a clue where to bring them since I was the one who took these orders. So after messing up my entire system. messing up the existing tickets by bringing them to wrong tables, and basically dooming the entire workday, he just gave me back the wallet and the orderman and tells me that I could take over now. I thought about just handing him my apron and quitting, but looking at the faces of my coworkers who looked like they had given up on life, I decided to try to help them.   
The entire shift after that was an absolute mess, customers refused to pay because of delays, orders were forgotten, yada yada. When most of the customers were gone me and my coworkers took a break, sat outside in the sun and had a beer before cleaning up, none of us talked.  
I would have quit, but I did really like my coworkers and didn't want to leave them hanging, so I kept working there til my contract ended. Altough the last 1 month I took all my paid leave, overtime, and sickdays and still got paid without having to see the owners again. Fuck that place.Is your name Karen?

"We are a celebration style restaurant. We get a lot of birthday cakes people bring in. We have great deserts to buy though...

When I started I was specifically told, we will bring the cake to the table but we don’t put candles in it or light them, and the guest serves themselves, we don’t cut outside cakes, the guest does that.

i thought that was crazy...until I had my third cake while working there that they said they wanted 21 candles, which when I took the cake from the cooler I placed the 21 candies, brought the cake out lit it for Happy Birthday,....and was bitched at that the candle placement  “‘ruined the design.”

so nope, never again, as per policy we don’t cut, package leftovers to go, apply candles, or light candles on outside cake and we don’t sing. It’s not our product.

Tonight was doing a 12 top they had a cake, I brought out a large oval tray with cake, serving plates for # of guests,  silverware, knife and serving utensils.

my partner was not happy I was 100% against cutting and serving...he‘s new.

I asked him...”are we getting tipped off that fucking cake? Is it going on our sales? Do we charge a cake-age fee? Will we see a dime over the autograt in it if we do that?”

Took everything out, told the guests ‘We leave outside cakes up to the guest so they can control both it and the piece size, if you need boxes to take slices home let me know.”

They were ok with that answer.

about 10 minutes later my partner comes up to tell me “The cake is a disaster”

”What?”

”I guess the middle layer was hard (it was carmel supposedly, they had told us to fridge the cake) and when they cut it they couldn’t get through and the layers separated and moved around and one layer slipped off to the side.”

"So I was a host but I don't know where else I can put this story. So background the restaurant I worked at was in a downtown area and on a river that runs through downtown so the host stand is outside and we have a menu on display so we could bring more people in to eat.

This guy and a couple of his friends walked up (the main guy was obviously drunk) and started looking at the menu like alot people do and I do me normal greetings and start talking to him about the menu. He then explains that they don't want a full meal just appetizers and drinks and I show him the appetizers and tell him about our ""triple dipper"" which is chips, queso, salsa, and guacamole. After I give my ""sales pitch"" he says ""oh I'll get that"" so I tell him ""alright I'll get you a table and you can order that with your server"" so I ask him how many there was and he says like 8. Well it's like 15 minutes to closing so I go check with my manager and he tells me to sit them outside and they would be the last table. So I sit them and start cleaning my menus for the night and like 20 minutes later I see the same guy talking to his server and he looked upset so I walk over to help out. The man points at me as soon as I start walking over and says ""him that's the guy I ordered it from"" me and server give each other a look of pure confusion. The server then says ""I'm sorry but he is the host you can't order with him"". The guys then looks at me ""I told you I wanted the triple dipper"". I then say ""Yes you did sir, but I had told you when I sat you that you would have to order with your server."" The guy then storms away and I went back to cleaning.

"Sorry but i always see these posts but want to share my story. I’ve been working as a host at an Asian restaurant for over a year now (in January) and my job said to just learn the menu and they’d make me a server. The days I work aren’t even that busy but I sometimes will need to bus a table or two if it gets busy.

So i asked questions about being promoted a couple of weeks ago my manager said they’d promote me when they hire some new hosts (no one is applying here to my knowledge). One person was promoted before me after working only for a couple of weeks and I’m convinced it’s because they are from the same racial and ethnic background as the owners.

Another person was hired then told not to come back after their first day on the floor alone due to a rush (an 8 top, 6 top and some smaller tables came in all within a span of 30 minutes, they were the only server on the floor) and they didn’t perform adequately. Bartender and management were talking shit the entire time.

So third strike is that this girl who has barely any server experience comes in gets a serving job on the spot, she looks familiar because she was fired from my previous job (love triangle in the job gone wrong). Turns out she is the same race/ethnic background as well as the owners. She starts training and is on the schedule, so I confront my manager and ask what the deal was because I thought we were looking for hosts and I could be promoted to server (I’m reliable, friendly, know the menu inside and out). He just reiterated that they need me as a host and can’t promote me until they find someone for me to train.

Not only do I feel like I’ve been discriminated against for my race (or not being a certain race) but I feel so stupid for sticking around so long, picking up shifts when needed, coming in on days off (including during my vacation when servers NCNS), and being a team player. My sister is a lawyer and says it sounds like a Title VII claim waiting to happen. 

Thankfully I got a job serving at a corporate chain. My first night on the floor the other night went great and now I feel like I can get this experience I want and move on from hosting. It’s not glamorous but I’m going to learn the ropes and move on when it is time. I’m finishing my two weeks and the management is giving me the cold shoulder but I don’t care because at least I gave notice!

I know it’s a tale as old as time but just remember it’s not you, it’s them. They could train you if they wanted to. Every server has had that first table they’ve ever served you just gotta find someone willing to take the chance!Skipped for promotion + racial discrimination??",TalesFromYourServer

1) orders a mai tai. We don’t have the stuff to make that but I recommend a very similar drink. He rolls his eyes but agrees. I bring out the drink, and he flips out saying “WELL I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU BROUGHT US BUT THESE ARENT MARGARITAS!” 
Nope they are definitely margaritas. 

2) he reorders the drink, bartender runs it out and he’s convinced it isn’t the same drink. Bitches about it but drinks it. Whatever. 

3) we have a combo meal that has a 2 dollar up charge for a certain food item. IN BOLD it says this on the menu he ordered from. I bring him his check and you would have thought I added 100 dollars to his check with the way he freaked out. Over 2 dollars. My manager comps 2 bucks off and he’s degraded me so many times that I refuse to go back to the table. He’s got his check and paid so fuck it. 

4) he left me a 5 percent tip after I ran through hell and back for him and got the manager to discount his check.

"I work in a very busy restaurant, which has me working 6-9+ hours without a break. I recently noticed that our payroll manager has secretly and manually clocked me and other serve staff in and out for 30min meal breaks that we never get to take nor allowed to take. 

Sometime last year they forced us to sign a “meal break” policy in which we could/reserve the right to take a meal break. However, I was always under the impression that if we do choose to waive our 30 min meal breaks on an 7+hr shift, the state of California enforces the company to pay some type of time and half to the individuals who don’t break. 

I’m pretty sure it’s illegal for them to manually clock us in and out for break without our consent, but I’m assuming by them doing so is to avoid any sort of compensation pay for not breaking.

I’m a good server but it was so embarrassing tonight telling multiple tables “I don’t know” about half of their questions. There’s nobody to ask! I accidentally over charged someone a dollar and couldn’t figure how to fix it in the system and it was one of the most awkward encounters I’ve ever had. I’ve been second guessing this job for a bit.

It wasn’t possible for me to be short. the closing list was atrocious as well! There was probably 20 things to do, most very time consuming and we have to cleaning the restrooms.

A little background! In the restaurant I used to work at, whenever someone had a birthday we would play happy birthday loudly and bring out a slice of cake with a candle on the house. I loved it! It would get specially old people and kids so happy! We would know through reservations or simply by having someone go over to a waiter and letting them know.

It was a busy friday afternoon and I had this couple at a table. The typical table where their answer to „hey! How are you guys tonight?“ is „a diet coke and a beer“. They had had no reservation and no presents or balloons with them.

We always gathered many birthdays in different sections so we wouldn‘t constantly be playing happy birthday. The couple was finished eating and were drinking as we brought out a round of birthdays. Once the music was off the woman waved me over, looking seriously pissed.

Me: Hey! How can I help you guys?
Her: Well, it‘s my husbands birthday today, where is his cake?
Me: oh, I wasn‘t aware of it ma‘am, sorry! I‘ll gladly bring him one in a few minutes!
Her: no! The surprise is now ruined! We don‘t want your leftovers! The service is terrible! Ruining his birthday like this!
Me: I‘m so sorry, did you tell one of my colleagues that it was his birthday? They must have forgotten it, I really am so sorry for that.
Her: no, we didn‘t! But that‘s something you should know as a waitress!

I stood still for a few seconds, unsure about what to say, the husband seemed to be really embarrassed, sinking in his chair without saying anything. 

Me: oh... ermm... I‘m sorry about that, we really have no way of knowing! Next time simply let one of us know and we‘ll be more than happy to do it! As I said, I can still bring you guys a slice!
Her, rolling her eyes: as I said, we don‘t want it anymore, we‘re never coming back here! Just get us the bill!

But I cant understand how people feel it's ok to order your actual meal, have me wait on you while you're at the bar, have me serve you bread, drinks, salads, put your meal order in.... AND THEN LEAVE TO AN ACTUAL TABLE WHEN THEY CALL YOUR NAME!!!!

It's also bad managerial practice to not require your patrons to close the bar tab before you move, instead just saying ""we'll transfer the ticket""

Yeah? Are you also going to transfer the tip since I've done literally 75% of the work for this party?!?!?! 

Your ""sorry"" and ""thank you"" isn't going to pay my mortage.... jerks.

"Either last weekend or the weekend before, when I presented the check to one of my tables (which had a mom with 2 or 3 of her daughters who looked to be no older than 9), the mom just casually glanced at the check, then handed it to her eldest daughter. ""Here sweetie, you pay."" The daughter took the check from her mom and said in a very important-sounding tone ""OK"" and pretended to look over the bill. Then she passed it to her sister, lol. Eventually it made it back to the mom who actually paid but it was hilarious to see. 

Another time, I had a large party where the adults were sat at one table and all the kids were sat at another table because we didn't have a table large enough to accommodate them. It was explained to me at the beginning that they would all be on one check. When I combined the two tables' checks together and put the combined check at the adults' table, one of the dads joked that his daughter had money in her overalls (she looked no older than 5) and could pay her table's own bill. Of course they put a card down for me to run after joking about it.

"So I've been in food and beverage for most of my life. On rare occasions I've seen maybe 1 or 2 servers get into an altercation with customers ever. Yesterday I had a table come in and everything started out fine. They came in during the lunch rush I got them taken care of in a timely fashion and everything seemed fine. I cleared all their plates except for 2 that they were picking off of. They ended up sitting there with the plates for a long time. I asked a few times if they were still eating and everytime they said yes. So I left them alone trying not to bother them. I got busy taking care of other tables and started cashing out tables tables that got there before them. I was walking back to the kitchen when a guy from this table comes up to me with his credit card in hand. He looks at me and says 

""hey buddy you ever done this before?"" So I asked him
 
""have I ever done what before?"" 

""You ever waited tables before?"" Which really rubbed me the wrong way. So I asked him if he was ready to cash out and took his card. Even though we were slammed I got him cashed out quick and told them to have a nice day. 

I went to go talk to another table and get their order and while I'm standing there at this other table this asshole come up to me and starts staring me down. He was close enough to where I could almost feel him breathing down my neck. I looked at my table and apologized and told them to give me a second. I turned to the asshole and asked him if there was something else I could help him with. He shoved his card in my face and said ""yeah little pro tip for you, try not to hand people their card back with fucking grease on it!"" 

Apparently I had a little grease on my finger which I didn't even notice while I was running around. This guy was in my face and being a grade A dick. I was busy and didn't have time to deal with his nonsense so I said ""sir please leave"" and walked away because I had orders to put in and other things to do  As you can imagine that didn't go over very well. He started yelling 

""where's your manager? I need to speak to a manager!"" Both of which were behind the bar so I said either of them can help you and started putting in my orders on the computer. While I'm standing there he keeps asking me where the manager is (who are still in the same place about 5ft away.) I point them out again. While he's waiting he's standing there tying to get a rise out of me and starts talking shit. He asks me 

""So do you like working here?""

""Yes"" 

""Well too bad because you're out buddy!"" 

So after that I just ignored him until a manager came over. He tells them what happened and finally he leaves. I go back to the table I was talking to when he confronted me and apologized for the scene. They told me they were ready to step in because they though he was about to start swinging. My managers saw everything go down and agreed he was just an asshole. But all day I was thinking ""why?""

"To start with, this probably does happen often enough that it’s not that exciting, but I still loved it when this happened.

So, a couple of military guys come into the restaurant wearing their full regalia. They were on leave or something, and we were a pretty popular tourist spot. They get their food, they are all having a great time, and finally after an hour or so, they get up to pay. Well, a grandmother from another table had seen that group in their military garb, and was kind enough to pay for both her table of 10 and their table of 6. The military guys were really thankful, and they ended up leaving a hefty tip, along with the old lady as well.

"This is not a super wild story but it's the first time it's happened to me, and I thought it was a pretty weird/comical situation

A Karen and her family sit down and I bring them water, saying their waitress is going to be over with them soon (they are not in my section) 

They ask me to taste one of our wines, which I didn't mind so much because I wasn't that busy and I didn't want to be rude to them. They ask me details about it and thankfully I know that one well, because I've had it a few times and once a sommelier tasted and described it in front of me. 

I bring it over, Karen tastes it and approves of it, ask me for a bottle.

When I bring it over, Karen motions me to look at her phone, on which she has the liquor store website opened (in Quebec they have the same prices in all of them) and proceeds to show me how much cheaper it is to buy it there. Also, she says it's ""funny"" how they don't mention the caramelized notes that I talked about, and instead say the wine tastes of red fruits and spices. 

I say it's a pretty safe bet considering you could say that just about any red wines, and ask them what THEY taste. Not in a mean way, more a friendly- conversational - make them show their wine knowledge - way. 

She kind of laughs it off and proceeds to complain some more about the ridiculous price difference between the liquor store and the restaurant.

I mean, lady, have you ever ordered wine at a restaurant? What do you want me to say? Oh! I didnt realise they didn't sell it for 40$ at the liquor store. Let me go fix that, it is now 13$ and the restaurant is losing money:) 

Meanwhile I'm standing there like do I open the bottle or not? 

Then the husband says something to brighten up the mood along the lines of ""it's the price you pay to discover a new kind of wine and that's priceless"" which is stupid for so many reasons but whatever. They buy the bottle. 

Later on she complained that she actually hated the wine and would never get it again. She tells my bartender she should've gotten the one she saw her pouring earlier.  Jokes on you Karen, that one is 50$

They ended up waiting just over 40 minutes for their meals.

They were having a great time and we were having fun with great back and forth. Every year this time of year we are gearing up to do our Polar Plunge. Basically we raise donations to benefit the Special Olympics by jumping through the ice in a lake. This is my sixth year as the captain.  It's a great cause and I'm honored to be a part of it. Every year, I grow my beard out and the day of the plunge I shave it off for last minute donations. It's my favorite day of the year. I had a button made up years ago that says ""Ask me about my beard."" It's a great ice breaker and I can let people know we are in the community doing charitable work without any pressure for them to donate. If they do, they do, if they don't, they don't. I'm going back and forth with two of the people in the group about it after they asked about the button. They asked me how far my team was away from our goal? I told them we we're about $3000 away but should get close with the last week coming up next week. They look at each other and tell me they'd like to each donate $1500 a piece!!! I kind of laugh it off and say that's great, thinking they are joking. They both pull out their credit cards and tell me to ring them up. I was speechless. I might even welled up with tears.

"Welp, I was finally forced to find a new job due to how incredibly slow my restaurant continues to be even as we prepare for the busy season. Let me relieve all my grievances of this joint. 

It's a local chain, and from what I'm told, the higher-ups in the company care nothing for anyone, and that was clear from the lowest employee up. Our district manager, who was based out of our location and managed some days, quit because he wasn't respected enough, which says something.

Let's talk about him for a minute. This guy introduces himself to me by telling him 'now, keep in mind when you work with me, anything that happens is just business, don't take it personally.' Well, what that means is that his management technique is literal bullying. A small step out of line and he begins yelling at you, he made at least one employee cry every shift he manged, and when he was asked to come and speak with a liquor rep or a customer, he'd say 'tell them I'm not in today.' I literally jumped for joy when he quit. 

Brings me to the AGM, who was kinda mentored by the district manager. He started out cool enough, but he very quickly began using the DM's language and I knew we had a problem. This guy had no idea how to speak with customers and would literally yell or curse at them when they weren't where he wanted them or they complained. Nobody likes this guy and we all agree he doesn't know what he's doing. But according to the GM, he's actually good compared to other people in the larger company so he kept his job. 

I was a host, so we had to do a lot of togo orders. Well, I was required to enter the customer's credit card info over the phone so it was paid for beforehand. I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would give out their full credit card info over the phone. Most bartenders, who you had to transfer to if a customer refused to give out their card info, would be understanding, but there was one or two who would get so mad because 'that's not company policy.' Not to mention if one of the more rigid managers heard of it you'd get chewed out, all for making the experience easier for the customer.

 When you come to work, you're there to do the job, right? There were so many servers who were younger than me and still thought the world revolved around their own ass. We'd get attitude consistently when trying to get servers or bussers to do their damn job.

And finally, worst of all, our kitchen was insanely inconsistent. As I entered my togos, I left distinct and exacting instructions of what the customer wanted. These were noticed about 25% of the time when I entered it on the POS, pretty consistently when I went back and told them, but I shouldn't have to do that, right? I literally got my first yelp review calling me out by name because of the kitchen's inability to properly spread sauce on wings.

So... why did I stay so long? Well, the people there were pretty great, other than the attitudey ones. Honestly, if the AGM wasn't still around, I'd have dealt with everything else, but it just becomes too crazy after a while.Here goes!",TalesFromYourServer
"Okay... weird things going on at the moment. So I don’t know if this has anything to do with the lie he told me, but I’m just going to clarify in case it does: a couple days ago I reported this same boss for an incident I heard about from another host about how he let a customer stay after they threatened to shoot up the place (even though you’re supposed to take every threat seriously and kick them out). And yes, the server who got threatened came up to him crying and told him what happened and he told her to let them stay. I called corporate and filed a report against him. Anyways, now that that’s out of the way, something very strange occurred today. A couple days before today I got my automated text for my schedule and it sent out two different texts, one said I was working today and the other said I wasn’t. So, to be sure before I get all dressed up and come in only to be told I’m not working today, I called up the restaurant and asked my manager (as I said before, he’s the same guy who I reported) whether I was working today or not and what was going on with the automated texts. He told me I’m not working today and that I wasn’t going to work today because another manager fired one of the hosts (not going to tell her name for privacy concerns). This didn’t make any sense to me because why would I NOT work cause someone was fired? I don’t know, it would make more sense if he said she was GOING to be fired but instead wasn’t, but he straight up said that she WAS fired. So anyways, I texted the girl a couple hours later and asked why she was fired and she said “what are you talking about? I’m at work right now.” Just... what? So I tell her that the manager (whom I won’t name either for privacy concerns) told me she was fired a couple days ago and she said “I wasn’t. Why would he say that?” 

I don’t know, I just feel so off lately. It made no sense why he lied about such a thing and I don’t know if it has anything in any way to do with my report. I think I’m just experiencing general anxiety this week and I just want to know if any of you have any clue what’s going on. I’m semi-new to the restaurant business (I’ve only been working here three months and it’s my first restaurant job). I know there’s another host who’s told me that this manager lies a lot but why? Why would he lie about this? My first and only thought is maybe he’s just a pathological or compulsive liar, but if that’s the case, why would he lie about this when I would obviously find out at some point that she actually wasn’t fired since I work with her?! 

Ahhhh, I don’t know, I just feel like I’m going crazy. This whole place is so weird and has so much weird drama. I’m wondering if this is just the kind of people that restaurant jobs attract at this point, haha...Why did my boss lie about firing someone when they still work there?",TalesFromYourServer

This of course brought up some truly horrible memories and he, naturally, was still feeling pretty raw.

I have been in the industry for 17 years and can’t believe I didn’t know this. Just quit a job and found out the mandatory tip pool was massively illegal:
If you are required to tip out the owner, manager, supervisor, or any kitchen staff, this is illegal and you are entitled to back pay and they can be fined. I knew it was shitty behavior but did not know it was illegal!
If this happened to you at a previous job you have up to 2 years to take action, report them to the department of labor, or sue.
You can also find even more info by state, and I recommend familiarizing yourself with these rules and telling EVERYONE you know in the industry. 

Personally I am giving my ex restaurant the benefit of the doubt (for a month), you never know maybe they had no idea this was illegal either. I forwarded them this info and another article by a lawyer in our state, and will check back in a month with a friend that still works there.

"This happened last night, it was my first table of the night. A man walks in with his two kids, he looks at the sign we have on the counter, then walks forward. I ask him if he would like a booth or table, he says booth. I seat them, and then ask what they would like  to drink. (We don't really do introductions where I work.) 

He says the special. I knew what he was talking about, but that was for food, and I was trying to take their drink orders. So, I ask again what would they like to drink, he says I want the pickup special, and I say yes, you can do that, but it is a large 2 topping for dine in. Not a large 3 topping. But before I can finish saying that, he loudly says we're going somewhere else, I can't stand your attitude. You cant answer a simple question. 

Once he says that, I'm just incredibly confused. And just stand there as he is getting up. Then he asks where our manager is. I say he is upfront. He gets up, walks up to the counter, and proceeds to spew some lying bullshit to my manager about how I was rude and had an attitude. He leaves, good fucking riddance. Then my manager comes over, I explain what happened, he doesn't give a shit, and then says you need to watch what you say because you can come off as rude.

Also, I'm just thinking that it's hilarious that my manager says I'm rude, when he is literally one of the worst managers ever to his employees. The customers love him because he only ever cares about them. He doesn't give a shit about his employees. He never gives us days off if we ask for them, calls people retarded, stupid, among other things. Yells at the servers if we forget to ask tables if they want blue cheese or ranch for wings during buffet. Yells at us for not doing anything when it is slow as fuck and everything is done. Anything he can yell at us for, he will.
I honestly wanted to go home after that, but I didn't. Of course my boss continues to stare at me all night long, probably thinking I still have an attitude or some shit.

This whole situation was just hilarious. Also, it brings up a very important question. What is the ""Karen"" name for male customers?Man says I have an attitude for asking what he wants to drink.",TalesFromYourServer
"Last night we were slammed all evening, but everyone was performing well. Wait times were on point, the kitchen didn’t get backed up once, the dishwasher, despite being alone for the night, was a total rockstar. You get the idea. 

ANYHOW, let me introduce some folks I’ll henceforth refer to as Horrible Cunt Table, or HCT. 
The first I heard of Horrible Cunt Table was through murmurs from the bussers. According to kitchen-wide lore, HCT had asked for a manager as soon as they were seated, and our MOD had been stuck getting harangued by them for the past ten minutes. 

Thirty more minutes or so pass—I’m consumed by my own section, so I don’t give Horrible Cunt Table another thought. On a trip back to the kitchen from my tables, I happen to pass by HCT and it looks like they’re in need of boxes. Silverware is down, entrees are looking finished, not a single person is chewing. I, being a team player, (and out of morbid curiosity for an interaction with these people) approach and ask, sweetly, “May I get you folks some boxes?” HC#1 snaps her head in my direction, owl-like, unnaturally, and says in her best Spongebob Chicken Mocking Voice “NoO, We’Re StiLl EaTinG. MaY I gEt YoU fOlKs SoMe BoXeS??” I blinked at her for a solid eight seconds before retreating to the kitchen, deeming to never interact with them again. Some people just cannot be helped, y’all.They Mocked Me To My Face",TalesFromYourServer
"At my restaurant, all servers have to tipshare a percentage of their sales with the bartender. Apparently it is like a thank you for the bartender making drinks for other tables and because the bartender might be too busy making drinks to take enough tables for themself. I am very much against this since the majority of the time, the bartenders get all the people who want to sit in the bar plus their tables, so they almost always end up having more in sales than pretty much anyone else at the restaurant.

Anyway, so I made x number of sales yesterday with very little tips from the shift. After doing the math, my tipshare to the bartender came to exactly the number of tips I made for the whole shift (e.g. if I made 300 in sales, and 15 in tips. if tipshare was 5% of sales, I would have to give 15 to bartender.) I let her know I wouldn't be tipsharing since the tipshare amount is all I made in sales. She immediately called our manager and fussed about it. I ended up having to hand it over so I went home having put in a 4 hour shift with exactly $0 in income.

God bless tipsharing

"I had the rudest lady at one of my tables last night guys, and I'm still kinda mad about it.

So she gets sat with two roll ups,  so I know she's waiting for someone. I go over to see if she wants something to drink while she waits.

Me: Hi, how are you?

Lady: *silence, doesnt even acknowledge me*

Me: Ok, my names Kait...

Lady: *pulls phone out of purse, dials, and holds it up to her ear*

I walk away, kinda like wtf. Was this lady raised by cavemen? Idk. I go up to my manager and told him what happened and he goes ""Yeah, I wouldn't go back there until she waved me down, personally."" I figured I'd wait until her second person got there so I could get them in and out and over with.

15 minutes later her (what I assume to be) husband shows up, so I go over to get them drinks. He orders a water, and she says she doesnt want anything to drink. Ok. I go ""Ok, I'll be right back with that water,"" and as I step away she goes ""Wait! I want a hot water!"" Ok, fine. I go get their waters.

Drop off the waters, and the man says he has some questions about the menu. No problemo, that's what I'm here for, I dont mind answering questions. I feel like I know a hell of a lot about steak for someone who doesn't eat it.
Man: What's the best steak? (I dont like just saying a steak because everyone's different with what kind of steak they like)

Me: Depends really. Do you like a more lean steak or fatty steak?

Man: Lean.

Me: Ok, so you're going to want a filet, strip, or...

Lady: What's better, the rice or the fries?

Me: ... sirloin. I like the rice better.

Man: Thoes are the leaner steaks?

Me: Yup, and each...

Lady: My friend said you should get the ribeye. The ribeye is good.

Man: She says the ribeye is fatty. I don't want fatty.

Lady: You can cut the fat off

Me: The fat is kinda running through the ribeye, so that's be hard to do.

Man: I'll get the filet. That ones thicker than the strip, right?

Me: Yup, that ones going to be the most tender too.

Lady: You should get the ribeye. My friend said the ribeye is good.

Man: Maybe next time.

Me: ok, and what sides do you want with that sir?

Man: Fries and veggies.

Lady: Why would you get the fries! She said the rice was better!

Me: The fries are...

Lady: You should get the rice!

Man: Maybe next time. Are your flavored lemonades refillable? 

Me: Yes sir.

Man: Can I have a blue lemonade?

Me: Sure thing


So now I try to take this lady's order. She's been sitting at the table for 25 minutes now, so you would think that she knew what she wanted right? Nope. Not at all. She hemmed and hawwed, all the while I had one table that had just been sat and my other table was waiting for their check.
She kept saying she wanted one thing, then no she didnt want that. She said she wasnt that hungry, so she didnt want a lot of food. Finally, she settled on a kicker of ribs with the bbq sauce on the side because she doesnt like thick bbq sauce, whatever. I run to my other tables real quick, then put in their food and go grab the man a blue lemonade. 

Their food comes out, I kind of ignore them because I dont want to interactwith her more than I have to. I see she eats like 2 of the 4 ribs and then disappears for 20 minutes. I go up to the man and ask if they want any boxes, because his food is all gone and all they have are her ribs. He says that he doesnt know, and to wait until she gets back because he doesnt know if she's done.

She gets back and picks at her ribs some more. Keep in mind she's been here and hour and a half already. I go up and see if they need anything and she fucking says she wants to order food. Fuck her. She wants catfish. Fine. Husband asks her if she wants it togo? She says ""No, I want to eat it here."" Whatever. The man's lemonade is empty.

Me: Sir, do you want another blue lemonade?

Man: Sure, thanks.

Lady: It tasted weird. What other flavors do you have?

Me: Strawberry and raspberry.

Lady: Get the strawberry, the blue one tastes bad.

Man: It tasted fine.

Me: *ignoring the lady and straight up looking at him* Do YOU want the blue lemonade?

Man: No, just get the strawberry I guess.

Drop the lemonade off, their food gets dropped off. She sits there and picks at it FOR AN HOUR. Just takes off a pinch and eats it while looking at her phone. Her poor husband has taken to sitting with his back against the wall and legs up in the booth and is on his phone. The man is obviously bored out of his mind. I want to go over there and tell him to blink twice if he is in trouble and needs help. I'm telling my manager what's happening as its happening and hes laughing at my expense. I've never wanted to smack someone so badly in my life. I tell my manager I might hit this lady and go to jail. He asks if I'll need bail money. Probably.
 
They finally ask for a box and the check. Drop both off, pick up the check. Cash. Left me 10% and they sat for another 15 minutes while she played on her phone. Finally left after 3 hours of hell. I hope I never see that lady again.Rude Lady is Rude (Long)",TalesFromYourServer
"Breakfast cafe here!

Little back story, our restaurant is extremely busy on Saturday and Sunday. To the point where we don't take reservations on either day.  

EVER. 

We have a 18 top come in. State they had a reservation. Automatically, we absolutely know that's a lie. 

We found out that our other store in my town would accommodate them, but they refused they wanted it at our store. 

Cool, they would have to wait for a table. 

Waited close to 45 min for this table, party went from an 18 to a 13.

"So this is two stories of how yesterday can go and fuck itself long dick style.

I'm the Assistant Manager for a high end restaurant in a tourist area. Winters suck, summers are busy and make you want to kill yourself. Summer it's a 70 head ship, winter, it's a skeleton crew. So I'm also the host/takeout guy/phone answerer/keg changer/magician.

Very nice person calls looking to reserve. 
I'm halfway through writing down their information while on the phone when entitled bastard and wife come in.
He marches right past the host stand with the menus, ignores me as his wife enters the restroom and loudly says ""I'll go find us a Table.""
I apologise to the person on the phone, place them on hold and go to catch this guy.
""Excuse me sir, one moment please, I need to check you in and seat you.""
""Yeah, well, you ignored us.""
""Sir, I'm on the phone taking a reservation.""
""So a phone call takes priority over a walk in?""
The guy is screaming at me at this point. Both servers hear it. 
""Well sir, we typically get to guests in the order of contact. If this person had called as you entered, I would have asked them to hold. But as I was halfway through confirming the reservation, finishing that would have taken less time and still had you seated.""
""So. You're going to ignore someone in front of you for the phone.""
At this point, I know, my boss would absolutely back me on kicking him out. I could probably get away with telling him to fuck himself sideways.
But. It's winter. My servers need tips. So I swallow it down. I tell him I'll get him a table and seat the smug fuck who proceeds to tip 10%.
Both servers were pissed and it took all of my restraint not to ask the kitchen to Waiting this Bastard.

As for the title...

The kitchen is doing water glasses. Instead of placing 3 trays side by side, they place 3 trays of glass like a goddamn cake. Dirty tray bottom on lip of glass. So. Knowing how disgusting that is, I take them back to the kitchen. Tell the chef they need to redo these trays and they know damn well they can't stack trays.
The chef is tired. I'm tired.

""YES BUT THE PART YOU PUT YOUR MOUTH ON WAS TOUCHED BY THE BOTTOM OF THE GODDAMN TRAYS""
""PAH, IS FINE. NO PROBLEM""

"Getting back into the server world after a long time away. And I’m feeling woefully inadequate. Could use some guidance/pep talk. 

The place I’m at is a super popular family owned place. We get slammed every single night which is good! But also bad some nights. We don’t have sections, we do rotation. I don’t get the big parties - or even the 6 tops. I get the deuces, 3’s and 4’s, I’m still new at this place (and just getting back into server world)  so I get it...at least I’m not stuck with just deuces like I was my first 2 weeks there. At any given time I’ll have 8 tables (or more) in various stages. I pushed 22 tables in a 3 hour rush tonight
Our ticket time is about an hour give or take. 

Servers make the salads, warm up the bread, drinks, bus, dish out/prep the desserts - easy stuff like tiramisu and cheesecake - except for the fucking cannoli which we fill per order. Open the wine and beer table side after waiting a sometimes gawd awful length of time to even get the wine/beer from bartender. And bless her heart, she’s working a 18 seat bar by herself AND trying to sling drinks for 7-8 servers. 

All this is happening with tables scattered from one side of the restaurant to another. 

Oh - AND the salad/dessert bar is shared by all of these servers and the bartender PLUS the take out prep people (DoorDash, Grubhub, postmates and Uber eats) so good luck finding a space to even make your salads or desserts unless you literally elbow your way in to the station. 

I feel like I’m doing nothing but apologizing for basically everything about my slow ass service.

For what it’s worth....I’m at a 22% tip out but I still feel like I suck and it’s sympathy tip - not tipped because I gave awesome service.

"Hey servers!  
I'm a host at a breakfast restaurant, and we get super busy most days, waitlists probably thursday-sunday. I am also normally the only host, regardless of how busy it is. I'm the only ""actual"" host, the rest are just bussers who are in highschool and just work when they can. This place just opened so we're all kinda on the same level (no seniority within the restaurant), I wanted to be a host because I feel the income is more predictable. I have a few questions about random day-to-day stuff that I feel are weird in my restaurant, and want to see how others operate. 

1. Do you let your host know if you're cut? I'll go to seat a table and servers get visibly annoyed and tell me they're cut. How in the world am I to know that? Is that normally on the management? I'll always happily assign the table to another server but I'd prefer to avoid the situation altogether obviously. 
2. Do you expect the host to bus all the tables? A few servers will pick up their tip, and not touch a single dish. Being the only host, and sometimes without any bussers, this really causes people to pile up at the door. We weren't too busy the other day, but because I was the only host and there were no bussers, there was a 20 minute wait list because a few servers would not bus their tables. We also pre-set our tables, so bussing and pre-setting a table entirely on my own can take up to ten minutes if it's a big one. Obviously, causing a backlog of people and a lot of empty tables. If I were to approach these servers about how this makes it hard for me to do my job, what would be a good way to go about it? I don't want to be rude but it frustrates me to nooooooo end.
3. If you pre-set tables: Is this the host's job? For us it was never really delegated, but some servers come up to me and say something like ""hey. Can you set up table 8. Thanks."" Like, not a question. Then go just stand there in the host booth and hang out. Like why????? I have people I need to seat, you have no tables. Can't you at least assist??? Is that a fair way to feel?

I actually really like this job, but being new to the formal restaurant industry I am not sure if these are like normal things I should just shut up and deal with or if they're worth bringing up.

"So tonight we went to a local restaurant my family frequents at least 4 times a month.  The service is never great per se, but we love the food and have never had any major problems. There tends to be an ever evolving rotation of staff due to the small town vibe of the restaurant, so sometimes it can be lacking, but I never tip below 20% wherever I go. 

So tonight we decided to head there. Made a reservation for 7:30. The restaurant stared small but has been picking up in business lately which as a local we love to see. 

Arrived and was sat at 7:29 by the hostess. Decided beforehand we wanted to order an appetizer immediately as sometimes they bring apps and dinner at the same time. 

7::30- menus on table, no one from staff comes to table. Mind you it is fairly busy, staff rotates a lot and it’s busy. It’s a BYOB and no one has come yet to the table.  

7:45 -  decide to raid the station that had a wine opener and wine glasses. Servers at all tables around us, our menus still in the table. No one has even laid eyes on us for 15 minutes. 

8:00 - it’s been 30 minutes. At this point it became a game to see if anyone would pay attention to us. At this point two waitresses and the hostess that sat us have walked past at least 5 times each. Thank god for wine. 

8:10 - I haven’t eaten all day. We wanted to see how long we could go before anyone would notice we existed, but I was too hungry at that point. I walked over to the hostess at the front Mt and let her know we were there for 4o minutes and still had no service. She immediately took care of us. It was odd because she wound up getting us our water, taking our order, bringing the food, etc. 

To my point...  we have had nothing but good experiences there before tonight. I would never bring this up on social media about the place or staff or anything and the food that came out was awesome like always. I guess my question is...

1. How did we sit for 40 minutes without getting noticed at all by like 4 staff walking by multiple times?

2. As a server, what would you expect as a tip percentage-wise if it was a hostess doing everything?

Again I am not bringing staff down. I love interacting with staff and typically 20% is my minimum tip. I know we probably could/should have spoken up sooner to the staff but after 20 minutes it sort of became a challenger.

anyway, about two weeks ago I was let go by this place. The Saturday night I was the closer and this girl was super drunk and kept ordering drinks. She wasn't tipping me at all and she was being belligerent to me and the MOD and kept coming up to me while I am at my tables. I complained about her to one of my friends at the bar and one of the regulars overheard me (Again, I take accountability for it. I shouldn't have been venting where customers could hear me).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I show up to the shift Monday and I was told I was being let go because of that. Bitching about a customer and the regular reported it to the owner.

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me is the coworker I mentioned before, I have reported to the owner, management(five times in total) had never really been reprimanded and I was fired because I spoke ill of a customer. 

Again, if that is the reasoning, I am fine. But the whole entire time I had been working there, I always felt I had to be 100 percent because they couldn't;t NOT hire me for being trans but part of me feels like they were looking for a reason to get rid of me.

I did my job well, I had several regulars asking for me in the 2 months I worked there and I have had several 5 star reviews (which one of the managers said was amazing because they had been struggling with reviews).

"I got a job serving at a senior living community a few months ago. It has been absolute hell since day one. The kitchen manager is a grumpy fuck who purposely gets resident orders wrong and will scream/cuss/throw things when you ask for the correct item. Higher ups can’t get get on the same page. One person will tell me to do things a certain way, then a different person will come around and scream at me for doing it that way. Employees treat each other like absolute shit. One employee went around saying the N word to people and is still employed/never reprimanded at all. This week I found out my hours had been cut out of nowhere, despite us being short handed and more residents moving in every week. I saw my schedule was changed and I won’t even make enough to pay for childcare so fuck it. I’m not going back.

"I  got my first serving job a month ago and holy shit, what is this madness?

 I've had a LOT of jobs, I'm 24 and I've had jobs from wine sales to welding to escape rooms. I've never been fired, and most employers like me, but I'm young, I move alot, and am still trying on many shoes.

What the fuck is this bullshit, is this normal? I work in a mom and pop Mexican restraunt, it's a small place with 20 tables total but it can get busy. To give you an idea, on weekdays there is usually one person working foh from 9 to 3, but no more than 2 people working front of house (serving, bar, busing, hosting the whole 9 yards) the whole day. 3 on weekend evenings.

I opened for lunch at 10 but the closing servers from the night before hadn't set any of the tables and had completed only half of the closing list side work so I was behind from the start. Around noon and I had 6 tables and a few at the bar, I was doing ok, but still behind. The kitchen had lots of new cooks but stuff was mostly coming out right and on time. Then my boss told me about the golden girls.

A 14 top with ALL individual checks. What the fuck?!

These old ladies started pouring in and collecting like a swarm in the back room with our biggest table. Karen after Karen (no joke 2 legal name Karen's in this squad) the book/knitting/ gossip/casual alcoholism team assembled. 

Of course they all wanted different cocktails, nearly one of every variety, I smiled back tears as I flipped my notepad over for each individual check, knowing the next 3 hours will be unpleasant at best. After taking all their orders I made the drinks as fast as possible while still looking out for my other tables. Every time I returned to the 14 they were chatting away and totally ignored me even if they asked about ingredients etc minutes ago... when they ordered anything they were picky at best.

However after they had all left (mind you I was still occupied with 4 other tables) there were 2 checks still unpaid! What the fuck? I honestly dont know if these crones were too senile for self awareness or if they just didn't give a fuck. 

The server coming in next at 3pm calls in saying hes gonna be 30 min late, comes in an hour late and complains that silverware isnt rolled, not all the tables are set etc... so I take my 30 minutes (finally) and fantasize about driving away.

I come back and the shit show resumes. The designated bartender cant keep up with orders, the kitchen is full of new people and everyone but me is falling behind. I run food for other people, I pre bus tables in other sections. But the ""designated bartender"" (and owner's daughter) for the ENTIRE restraunt is busy talking to people at the bar instead of making MY drinks (which I'm not allowed to make myself because ShEs The bARtEndER AfTer SiX oN tHe WEekENd) and we have to tip her out for it. So all my drinks come out super late, I dont get good tips.

After things settle down chef comes out and talks to everyone about how they're doing a shitty job (confirmed with him later he was NOT talking about me). And all said and done I didn't make more than my other hourly job as a barista.

When I work here I dissociate super hard so I'm an emotonless robot outside of putting on a show for my tables. I like sales, but what the fuck even is this? How is everyone outside me and the head chef so incompetent? 

I put in my 2 weeks tonight as I applied to the bar I got a drink at after work (I am certain I will get the job). Chef was sad and wants me to stay, he knows how I feel but how can I still work here? I love the restraunt but loathe the coworkers. I cant make good money if I cant give good service. 

Serving is weird, how can people be so incompetent? I kinda just want to go work in a warehouse now and listen to podcasts all day, maybe I should try sales next 🤷‍♂️

Edit &amp; update: I did forget to mention that it turns out the tickets for the drinks that night were being sent to the wrong printer so the bartender was doing the best she could but missed a good deal of drinks. 

I ended up staying at the restraunt, the owners value my hard work which is rare for service industry. They are turning over a lot of staff that was causing problems and giving me priority, so I'm happy here for now. But the biggest reason is the money. Tonight we had a company party come in, all said and done I made about 300 in tips today.

"Hey all, I'm helping my new restaurant develop a new job position. Corporate has eliminated traditional bussers or expos, but we aren't opposed to bringing back those terms. This position will be staffed from existing servers, so it will take away from their serving shifts; usually 2 shifts per server each week, unless the server only works a few shifts a week then they won't have to do this (tips are around $200/shift). This is basically the job duties. What would you describe the position as or the job title be most like? Foh or boh?

* Ask bar if they need help during shift
* Wash and stock bar dishes
* Empty Garbage throughout shfit
* Restock all pots, pans, dishes and glass ware
* Run food and drinks
* bus, clean and reset tables
* Keep Ice Filled

"I dunno why, but I’ve been in a mood where I’ve reminisced all of my cringey experiences in the industry. This particular story places #2 in my top three, worst experiences. 

I was a hostess at the time. A server working with a party table was pretty upset with them. From what I recall, it was an issue with trying to play “Spin the Wheel of Comping” as well as oddly needing refills every second on gallon-sized drinks. Not to mention that two parents were heavily drinking our “Big A$$ Margaritas” as they had to take an infant home. I’m sure the server could tell a better story on that. This is my hostess story. 

I was obligated to clean tables after people left. And boy, oh boy, this was incomparable to any table I’ve had to clean. Clearly, the customers did not allow the table to prebus (we knew which servers actively prebussed or did not; this server prebuses), so I was left with a table covered with more plates and bowls than with... table. Not to mention that the chairs needed some deep scrubbing at this point. 

I was stacking the plates immune to any other smell than the smell of salsa and guacamole. But something caught the corner of my eye. A ginormous, brown, seeping diaper smack dab where those drunk parents were sitting. Quickly, I grab two rags together, tying them into a bandana. I wrap it around my nostrils to get to work. With some napkins, I lifted up the diaper hastily disposing of it into the trash can in the women’s restroom... by the baby changing station. 

Yep, two, drunk parents decided the best place to change their infant was in the middle of a busy, dining room of a Mexican restaurant. Somehow, that will always be worse than cleaning up cocaine in the bathroom.Poopy diaper",TalesFromYourServer

"I was working at restaurant that served wings, both boneless and bone-in. Sometimes, customers would order chicken tenders and have them spun in sauce, as opposed to the sauce coming on the side to dip in.

We had just had a meeting during which we got to try new menu items and to discuss changes, one of which being that we  would no longer allow customers to order their chicken tenders spun in sauce. 

During slow shifts when we didn't have a hostess on shift to take to go orders, whoever got to the phone first both placed the order for the customer and checked them out when they arrived.

The woman wanted tenders spun in sauce and I informed her that we were no longer allowed to place these orders and offers alternatives. She was rude before I even told her this so I didn't expect her to be easy about it. 

She wasn't and argued that she had always ordered them that way. I apologized her and again informed her that the change came from the general manager and I wasn't able to place her order as she wanted it. I got tired of arguing with her and told her I would put her on the phone with my manager. 

Of course, my manager agrees to do it for her and gives the phone back to me. Cool. I do what I'm told to do and my manager doesn't have my back. No surprise there. 

She's even ruder than before and talking down to me even more because her bratty entitled attitude was rewarded. I finished the call and called her a cunt just a moment too soon as the phone hadn't quite made it to the receiver.

"Obligatory first time poster, on mobile warning. 

Longish story. 

I am a server at the hut of pizzas. The passed few months (winter in upstate NY) We've been relatively slow. Probably never more than 200 tickets in a day. 

Anyway, im the closer and I had a table ready and waiting when I get there at 6 PM. From then on I had tables. Carryout was a 30 min wait, delivery was even more slammed, so you can imagine the wait for dining room. 

My 4th table orders a Large HT Meat Lover. Put their order in. Have 1000000 things on my mind and am running around like I've lost my head. 

A Large pan Meat Lover pops up in the server rack and I don't think, just take. It (obviously) ended up being NOT MY PIZZA. It was my midshifters (JT) pizza for a table who had already been waiting a while. I felt horrible. She goes out and explains what happened, and they say they dont mind, they'll just take my tables Hand tossed Meat LVer. My tables order was 4 tickets behind hers so it was a bit more of a wait.

To make matters worse. My tables ticket was bumped prematurely, so THE HAND TOSSED MEAT LOVER WAS NEVER MADE. JT goes back, makes the pizza herself, and throws it in the oven. 

In all they waited more than an hour for their pizza.

Her table took it in good stride. Good spirited older men. We still comped their entire meal. I went over myself and apologized for it happening and they were joking with me and laughing about it. 

HAPPY ENDINGS:

Before comp, their check was 24 something. They tipped JT 7 bucks. 

They came back in today (Friday 2/21) got the other midshifter, JN, and got another Large Pan Meat Lover. JN was also there Valentines day so she knew what went down. She let's me know they are here and jokes ""don't steal this one okay"". Then she actually offers for me to run it and I scoop it up, bring it to the table and sit and joke with them for a minute about stealing this one and running away with it, leader of the group playfully brandished a fork at me. 

High five to them for being so understanding and cool about it. 

TLDR; stole another table/servers pizza on accident. Her table said yes to taking my tables pizza. My tables pizza ended up never being put in. In all, her table waited about an hour for their pizza, got their meal comped, still tipped over 20% of their original total and to this day continue to joke about it with us.

"For all of my servers whose dining areas are on carpets, doesn’t it upset you having to sweep/section tables with muddy floors? I have literally seen footprints leading to tables or bigger tables caked with mud from a party of I guess outdoor-ish workers. 

Especially on weekdays, it is a pain in the ass to sweep. I have to take a rag to clean off all of the mud. They literally play footsie with the table legs. And then I spend 5-10 extra minutes sweeping under that table to get all of the mud and grass under it. Not even a wet rag or a paper towel can clean that crap up. I just hope the closer is lenient enough to not make me re-sweep. It’s annoying that these people can either just change shoes at home or if they could just wipe their feet before they enter through the door. 

Honestly. it feels disrespectful that they don’t even try to wipe their feet even a little bit before walking through the door. It’s like an obligation for us to clean up after them like children.

"Some people...

Two days ago, we had a guy come into our restaurant in order to buy two of our fish sandwiches that we have on sale, but he wanted them 'fresh'.  No problem.  I can see why you can have a bad experience with a sandwich that makes you want to ensure their freshness.  I tell the fryer to drop two fresh for him and finish his order.  However, about a minute and a half later the sandwiches come forward and he majorly flips over ""I know that it takes longer than that to fix the fish!"" and ""I want them FRESH!!"".  I tried to explain to him that we'd had some fish sandwiches sell right before he'd come in and so they were in the fryer when he'd ordered.  They were INDEED fresh.  He continued to complain and finally I just looked at him and said ""Do you want me to have them make them again, starting with new fish?""  He did a deathglare at me and took the sandwiches and said ""I'll take them, but if they aren't fresh then I'll be back!!""  He didnt return that day.

Today I was working again when he came back.  He wanted another two fish sandwiches dropped fresh.  (I guess the last two passed his picky fish standards).  I went to the fryer myself.  We had two fish that were just less than a minute from coming up, but I stated to them I wasn't going to listen to him witch and moan more so just drop two right now for him.  My manager even offered to fix those two for him since they literally came up, but he made a snide comment about taking an old fish and dropping it for a short while in the fryer for a 'fresh order'.  So his happy hiney got to wait for five minutes for the exact same sandwiches that he would have gotten at the beginning of his tirade.Dealing with your carp",TalesFromYourServer

Right off the bat they start requesting bottle service and a bottle of wine and some food, to which I was happy to oblige. They all got pretty drunk and even more people came to the table to have drinks. They racked up a 560 dollar bill including my 18% gratuity. I got a few more tables while they were drinking and having a good time. I go to talk to some tables for a bit and go in back to check on some food and when I came back they were gone. I was dumbfounded as these people were buying quite expensive menu items and drinks, and gave off a “wealthy vibe” if that’s the correct term. I immediately ran upstairs to see if they were getting more stuff at the bar. I checked all over the restaurant for them. Nowhere to be seen.

I let my manager know about the situation and then he notifies the owner/ boss.

The owner/ manager then goes to saud night club and makes them pay for the bill in full including the gratuity. The bill is then closed out under my other managers name as an open bar tab with no gratuity but the $560 total was still charged. The owner talked to me at the end of the night saying how he was about to fire me. I got written up for it which I understand.         -    Basically I am coming to you fellow servers and bartenders for advice. Should I accept this 80 dollar loss and move on and forget about it?

"So we recently rolled out Toast, a new-to-us compy/POS system.  It's...fine?  We had Aloha, which is great.  But the owner is super cheap, and didn't like the monthly fees associated with it. 

A) They decided to roll it out on us February 12th, with no training, and the manager/daughter was sick, so no help there.  Valentine's was stupid.

B) The owner is also super distrustful, so no one has manager codes, and of course we're making tons of mistakes because wtf, and trying to track her down to fix something which she always kinda questions (she's actually been a little better) sucks.

C)  Some old folks have literally thought I'm fucking around on my phone while taking their order on the handheld, which is about the size of a brick.  I have to say:  ""Hi folks, this is our new system, so bear with me while I ring your order in..."" so they get it through their heads that no, I'm not playing fucking candy crush while they order their Chicken Fried Steak.

D)  The one bright spot, I've found that taking payment on the handhelds, where they sign and choose 15%/20%/25%/other on the pad has helped raise my tip percentage quite a bit.  My section is the family side of the restaurant, so large families and old people, who generally don't tip well, and apparently their math skills suck, so I've definitely seen a jump, there.  

Anyway, that's my story.

Edit:  I'm curious how you all, that use the hand helds, handle presenting it for payment.  I'm old-school and don't want to linger while they tip, I try to never impose my presence when people are tipping, but we only have two hand helds, so I can't leave it for long.  So far my method has been: present a paper receipt in a check presenter, and when I see a card, run it at the table, briefly explain how they use it and walk away until they're done?

No one is on their phone or goofing off. Everyone is trying their best. But we're humans. We make mistakes. We do our best to correct them.

"Obligatory mobile not native etc. Long one incoming

 Necessary backstory: I live in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where our official language is Dutch. I am Dutch but not white, otherwise fluent without accent. I work in a Japanese restaurant with mainly Japanese people working there, so our main shop language is English, for the few co-workers who don't speak Japanese and the many customers who don't. The racism in this story isn't directed towards me, but my Japanese coworkers, the lovely Sen in particular (not her real name, but she reminder me of a Ghibli character so). She speaks Japanese only, with only basic English skills. 

 To start off the night, there was this lovely family of 3 sitting in a far corner. This one was more minor and light-hearted, to lift the mood before the fiasco to come. I was busy cleaning the table next to this lovely family, when I hear the son (about 12) loudly complain to his mom why they're in a Japanese restaurant, where all the people don't even speak Dutch (Sen had tended to them earlier) and had weird accents. Why they couldn't just go to somewhere with actual tasty food. Mom didn't really seem to care and completely ignored the whining, going on about how wonderful a different Japanese restaurant was. In the end the son had barely touched his food when his Mom and Sister decided to leave, but he angrily tried to stay behind to eat more, because it tasted so good. 





 Now onto our bigger story, which probably disgusted me more than it should, but my disgust was confirmed by customers who had been there the entire time. At this point it was getting rather late, so after 8PM, and this group of 6 comes waltzing in. Luckily for them there was only one other table filled so they could actually sit down. They looked like a bunch of men just finished with a week of physical labour, ready to get drunk.

 We greet them with the standard いたらしゃい (welcome) and they respond with *muah*. Off to a great start. Sen tends to their table and immediately they restart the conversation with more kisses and copying anything she says that sounds remotely funny to them. Sen, being the amazing human she is, responds with a small laugh and proceeds to take their order. Because the amount of beer they order is more than she can take by herself I assist her, but the moment we return to their table, they're back to making sexually tinted comments about her. The kicker: they're speaking only in Dutch from now on. She leaves before I do, cleaning up a bit after some beer spilled on an adjacent table. They start loudly (and I mean really Loudly) talking about how Sen is clearly putting up an act to refuse to speak to them. About how she can surely speak Dutch and understand their comments. This continues all the way up until they finally check out, which takes ages, considering some of them were too dumb to even remember what they ordered. 

 I go to clean their table, and it was probably the most disgusting state I've ever seen any table be left behind in. The floor got as much noodles as they probably did, considering they barely ate half. It took extra strong cleaner to even get any cleaning done. When I return to the counter, they're still busy making comments, figuring out who pays for what. They turn their attention to me, asking me if I came from somewhere nearby (I have no idea, it was slurred and for all I know he could he asking about my school, I'm not from the area). Not planning on giving him the satisfaction he wanted, I just smiled at the one asking and responded in Japanese that I had no clue what he said. He turns his attention back to Sen and suddenly they all try to bribe her to speak Dutch. It took me standing next her at the counter with an annoyed smile (I'm a lot bigger built than she is, and a lot less cute, Japanese looking) to finally get them to lay it off and pay. They didn't tip, of course (not mandatory in the Netherlands for any Americans who wonder)

 When the table that had the horrendous fate of sitting next to them paid about half an hour later, they were appalled for us, and apologized for not stepping in. Apparently they heard a lot worse things than I did, but they didn't want to have to repeat it for us. They actually left a tip for our troubles, and were really nice and apologetic about the whole thing. The worst thing? Sen had no clue any of it was going on. To her it could have just been any sort of drunk mess.Friday brings the racists out",TalesFromYourServer
"I applied to a fine dining serving position with my cover letter and resume. Immediately after they email me to call and set up an interview. I went to that interview today. dun dun

The owner proceeded to roast me the majority of the interview, haha. I have 10 years serving experience including in fine dining. The owner told me repeatedly they, ""don't hire people like you with resumes like this."" He told me I've had too many jobs. At least 3 times he held up my resume and said how they, ""don't hire people with resumes like this.""

He asked if I ever ate there which I haven't so he told me, ""we have to find you a rich man to take you here."" Another fun question was, ""Your rich uncle is coming into town tomorrow and he says he will take you and your child to any restaurant you want. Where would you go?""

"By Current Journalism Major (who knows how the real Redditors like their stories - AP Style)

I spent my entire career as a server over four different locations, all corporate. This current one is arguably the best job I've ever had, (yes, still young and learning, cut me some slack), and it's unrivaled with about every restaurant near it.  It drives the community.

Today, though, after a solid four months of ""hitting the ground running"", I fell. And this fall was momentous, both literally and figuratively.

Put simply, my job is built into an over-priced, super-faux-luxurious, plaza-apartment-strip that mimics Times Square - but for families and the elderly with lots of money to waste.

Right next door to my job is a theater that occasionally holds plays and operas that attract DEFCON-1 customers. These customers come in waves, they travel together as if they're hyenas, and act no differently. Today, I was the sacrificial lamb.

It all started with 4 elderly ladies that came in five minutes before happy hour ended. We granted them an extension - unbeknownst to us that this party was about to multiply. By 6:30 - 30 minutes after our happy hour ended, the Karen party of four became a party of 34 - all separate checks.

The server who was unfortunate enough to be paired with me had to survive the onslaught of demands that since the original four ladies received happy hour, that all of them by extension, deserve the same right. My manager allowed it.

Everything seemed to run smoothly, we got the drinks in, and had it by seat number. Veteran servers, you already see where I messed up - should've done it by name, and it only gets worse...

Fueled by a Bang Energy to the skull, I was pumping out more waters with lemon and club sodas with lime faster than Usain Bolt can dart the 100-meter dash. My co-worker was getting plates and pre-drops ready to go. I was confident, nothing was going to mess this up. I headed to the bar and started gliding back with about 15 glasses of wine, all put in the same seat order.

That was, until my drink ticket betrayed me, right near the table.  It fell down and my nonslip sketchers were defeated, as myself, the tray, and wine cascaded to the floor. I was doused, from head-to-toe, in happy hour cabs and pinot noirs. Embarrassed, pissed, and slightly frightened that how much of a comp that was going to be, I picked myself back up, and silently walked to re-ring in every wine glass.

The Karens saw their opening, moaning and groaning over my misfortune, asking to speak to the manager as to why their wine was taking so long after seeing me at the POS system a foot away scrambling - first round, completely comped. Karen 1 - Me 0.

My coworker brought the new wine out, and the musical chairs began. Suddenly, ""Seat 1"" became ""Seat 15"", and my coworker and I became ""Super Weeded"". If this was football, what was coming would be equivalent to a JV high school team faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs today.

We tried to rearrange everything as the Karens picked at their heavily-modified apps/entrees with their unnecessarily long nails and complained about the noise in the restaurant. Some ladies found it fitting to knock over their waters on other's foods, resulting in rapid ""FLY PLZ GOD FLY"" remakes being sent to a BOH that was already drowning.

Suddenly, a movement began to check the time at the table - 15 minutes until doors open to their show. My coworker and I started to scramble to piece everything together as the ladies started to rise from their seats and surround us at the POS, credit cards in hand. My coworker disappeared to get the manager as the ladies heckled me to no end, utilizing every slander in the book as to why I needed a few minutes to gather their 34 separate checks. I tried explaining that no one made us aware of a show, and I was rushing it out as quickly as I could. My manager intervened and slowly became aware that his server now belonged to the Karens. 

Some wound up walking out on their check, causing a scene and others berated us until they paid for random items, but most importantly, I was overwhelmed and ready to just accept my fate. I thought I was finito, done, 86'd, whatever. I didn't even care that my coworker and I made less than 10% on a $500+ bill that was accounted for.

My beloved manager took the time, while comping an outrageous amount of items - to calm me down and let me know that everything was going to be fine. What felt like a disaster soon became a free meal and a sticker on the incentive wall next to my name. I got to keep the job, eat a meal, do my sidewalk and head home.

Karen 34 - Me 35.

TL;DR: Had many series of unfortunate events and the nightmare of nightmares as a table of elderly ladies, split checks, comps, and walkouts.

"So we got some 'new' EU laws.. Few months ago an old couple (the first two of a group of ten) asked for water for their dog, 'he's ten years old he needs to drink every ten minutes'. I was like 'yeah there's water  outside the front door for dogs, I'm not allowed to serve animals and humans simultaneously'.. She wasnt amused 'we always got it'. 
'Do I have to talk to your boss?' Sure he's right behind the corner, feel free to do so.
15 mins later the rest of the group showed up.. Four more dogs, under every table there's been a blanket and water bowls they brought themselves. I got barked and growled at each time I got close to those tables :)
In the end the very first dog managed to piss on the floor for like four times. Each time I saw it I said 'oh look he peed on our floor again' without stopping to walk.

"So my old restaurant I used to work at specifically said, “We don’t take reservations, only call aheads.” For those that don’t know, a reservation dictates that if you show up on time, you’ll be seated at that that time. A “call ahead” means that you get priority over walk-ins, but there can still be a few minutes where you’re not seated right away, say give us a 20 minute leeway. 
Lately going out to fine dining restaurants, we’ll get there and they’ll say there’s still a 30-40 minute wait. Even though we have a reservation. As someone in the industry, I think this is completely ridiculous. My ex’s restaurant told people when they made a reservation that they had a 2 hour window, after that they’ll politely ask you to go to the bar or leave. That’s how a reservation works. If I have a 6:30 reservation and theatre tickets at 9:00, asking me to wait is completely ridiculous. The restaurants around the theatre always ask, “How much time do you have?” Which is fantastic. But fine dining around other areas should stick to this principle. If I thought ahead enough to make a reservation, then you need to think ahead enough to make sure I’m sat at the time I reserved. As a server, I don’t think this is an unreasonable request.I’ve been kind of frustrated lately going out to eat",TalesFromYourServer

I told them (with the approval of my manager) they can order but its take away only as we would be closed by the time their food is finished. The customer then had a brilliant idea and asked if they can just get take away then eat it in the restaurant as they wanted to eat out that night.

"On mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. First post on here as well but damn I need to vent.

I work at a nice restaurant that specializes in fresh food and great cocktails. When I was hired they made a great deal about how their dress code was relaxed and all about how they want their employees to be able to have their individuality. Sounds great right? It was one of the highlights of this job to me, especially since the past few I've had have had strict dress codes.

Fast forward a few months and management springs on us that we'll be wearing aprons right? No big deal to me- I don't mind being protected from random food- and accept that paying for an apron is unavoidable. However they neglected to tell us that we would also be SEVERELY altering dress code. I have bought nice clothes only for the purpose of using them to go to work and now most (if not all) are not allowed. I don't think it's right to hire someone with the promise of one thing and then turn around and do the exact opposite.

I understand that businesses change and that you just have to roll with it but I'm not financially in a place where I can just go out and buy a whole new wardrobe, especially since I already have for this job. Not to mention in the decade they've been open nothing like this has happened. It just feels like I've been blindsided and there is not shit I can do about it. I was finally starting to enjoy this job as well so it sucks that this all happened.

Guess it's time to suck it up buttercup and either roll with the punches or figure something else out.

"I’m a server at a busy casual dining restaurant. To give you an idea, we did $136k Friday -Monday on V-day weekend. We don’t have a tip share system, and the amount we tip out to bussers, food runners, expos, and bartenders is up to the individual server.

I tip out based on the “10% rule”. 10% of my tips go to my busser, 1% of my food sales go to the food runners, 1% food sales also to expo, and 10% alcohol sales to the bartender. If I have $1000 in food sales &amp; $80 in alcohol for the night and make $160, busser gets $16, $20 divided btw expo &amp; food runner, and $8 to bartender. When I train new servers, I walk them through this process so they have a system to know how much to tip out. 

However, I know for a fact several servers aren’t tipping out AT ALL! They are the first ones to complain about shitty tips and show everyone when they get stiffed, then they leave without giving anything to their support staff. 

IMO, this is fucking unacceptable. I’ve worked in restaurants for almost 10 years, working my way up from a busser &amp; Expo. I know how hard these ppl work &amp; how frustrating it is when servers dont appreciate the work they do.

So my question for this sub is what can I do?? I’ve posted about this on our Facebook page. I’ve spoken up during our pre-shift meetings. I’ve even personally called out individual servers to their face when I know they didn’t tip out after the previous shift. They always give the same excuse; “I didn’t make shit”, “I did tip out I gave it to x&amp;y”, “OMG I totally forgot I’ll give them extra tonight”. 

I’ve tried everything but nothing has changed. When I heard our best busser left V-day, after working 8 hours, with $23 (5 servers in his section completely stiffed him) I decided that was enough and made it my mission to fight for these ppl. 

So Reddit, what’s the best way to get these selfish servers to take care of their support staff??

EDIT: corrected tip % of food runners &amp; expo, mean 1% of food sales, not 10%.

Also, management makes it clear that they are not involved in any way with our tip outs, and can’t require us to do so. I’ve been told that not having tip share is a trade off they give the servers in exchange for not having auto gratuity on large parties.Servers aren’t tipping out support staff!

"I work at a corporate restaurant and this never happens so i thought I’d share.
Managers at these corporate restaurants never have their servers back, luckily we got a new guy that doesn’t take shit from nobody.

We have this system that you can order your food and when you sit down it “should put your food in” granted I’ve worked at this place for three years and I’ve never seen the system in action nor have I ever had someone order from it.

This guy comes in with his wife, both were totally rude I greeted them and asked for their drinks, he responds “you should know what I ordered fucker” in my mind I wanted to spit in his face and tell him to take a hike but of course I kept my shit together. “I’m sorry sir I said, that system is stuff getting the bugs out but I can’t take your order now” he responds by calling me an ass hole and a fucker. At this point with only 3 min of communication with other this guy I was done with him treating me like I’m not a human trying to make a living. 
I go to the host stand and my manager tells me that on our site it says “under construction” in the pre order section meaning it doesn’t work, in big red letters this was written.
Finallly I take his order, his food comes out and everything was ok. He then walks over to the host stand while I’m standing there and says “I’m not paying for this and points at the host and says “this stupid bitch should have told us that we would be waiting an hour for our food” mind you that the wait was 45 min to get seated and he got his food within 10-15 min after sitting down. 
I stepped in the middle and said you can’t be calling people names like that and he got up into my face and started verbally abusing me again. 
 My manager steps in and he gets up into his face!! My manager is a huge guy and shouldn’t be fucked with. 
The guy is now demanding that his food be comped and he wants the number for corporate to get myself and the host fired. My manager responds “how about you get the fuck out of my restaurant and quit verbally abusing my employees” 
He then walked out and said “I’m never coming back” 
Response from the employees “k” 
Having a manager who has your back and will back you up in any situation is a rare site, if it was any of my other managers they’d be in their knees ready to brown nose him.

I headed back to where we put our bags, eat, drink coffee, etc. There's a server, we'll call her Amanda, who think she is the shit. I've talked to one of the mangers about Amanda before, and the manager says it seems that Amanda feels ""attacked"" when there are new servers.

I was on a food running shift tonight, traying up and running food, I was irritated that her wings, an appetizer that should take 8 minutes was going on 30. Kept yelling at the kitchen, especially when they put empty baskets as if they were sold but forgot to bump it. So I had the sauces, grabbed the wings, and out of nowhere Amanda pushes through people and yells at me ""this tray doesn't get hot sauce."" Well, you rang it in as a side, which everyone can see on the ticket. This was after being told it's more important to run - and this will give away where I work but whatever - our free fry refills ""to keep people happy"". 

God damn, if I just ran fries food would never go out. Ever. Every damn table gets fries before their meal and usually 2-3 more friends. That's about 90 tables constantly wanting fries, plus the bar.

I saw a post made not too long before I started typing this about a creepy manager, but the post became too long to comment so I've made a post. I'd like to address the industry plague of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

I'm a busboy but I do the job of three different people but I thrive in high-pressure situations so I frequently step in to help servers and bartenders when I get ahead.  I'm overworked and overpaid. That's a doozy of a story in and of itself and I've addressed it in post history, but this is to address female servers and the gross harassment they endure on a regular basis just to keep food on their table. This might turn out to be a rant so I hope yall brought the reading glasses.

&amp;#x200B;

The particular restaurant I work at has a reputation with hiring attractive young servers and literally only hires **FEMALE** servers and bartenders. There has not been a male server or bartender in the 15 year history of the place and my manager, the general manager who is closely related to the owner gets away with everything and I just want to get it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've become very close with a few of the more *extroverted* servers whose actions may well be considered flirting when alcohol is involved. However, my manager has taken it too far and has deliberately **told** them to come to the basement to make out, or to take body shots off-camer*a.  In one scenario he threatened a server (my girlfriend's) job if she did not come to hook up with him.* He (General Manager) is currently dating a Bartender openly and on several occasions now, I and the female servers have lied to cover his creepy ass.

&amp;#x200B;

On our Holiday party, he ditched his girlfriend and followed us to my car, where I drove all of us home because he literally would not leave my car, and the police would start watching the lot soon. We had a lot more drinks at her place, and He was hoping for me to leave and being so drunk, I was about to since I had an early morning, but I got a bad vibe and my girlfriend and I, with another female server friend, slept in my girlfriend's bed while he rode the couch ;) . He called his uber shortly after we went to bed and left without a peep. At the same Holiday party, **I had to physically remove him from my girlfriend as she's crying and verbally refusing his advance.** He quickly warns me never to touch him and tries to sell it as some sort of joke and game that they've had since before I started there. I don't think so. Disrespect to me aside, I'm not going to let any man touch my female friends or girlfriend for that matter, I don't give a fuck if he's my boss or the President.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen many girls just leave the place, but we have a baby and she can't afford to lose the job at the moment. I'm a college senior as well so I don't have the time to find a new one. We're both finding new jobs eventually, but I just don't want him to get away with this anymore. So many good people have left that place because of him and it's sad because I've lost many friends in the Year and 1/2  that I've worked there, simply because I don't see them anymore and we drift apart. It's UNBELIEVABLE that I have to set the example on how to act when I'm 22 and he's 47

* Video showing boss grabbing server's ass as she's crying and pushing him away
* Video showing server shake her head multiple times as my boss keeps on trying to get her to take a lime out of his mouth, which she then does

**OTHER SHITTY THINGS HE'S DONE**

* Snorted Cocaine off server's breasts
* Smoked Weed with his subordinates (legal state so no trouble other than the owner frowning on it)
* Comments about employee's uniform (Suggestions, Compliments, etc.)
* Pressured former server into Oral Sex
* Requested Nudes from Servers
* Demanded Tip-Outs from Servers even though he is a salaried employee (This is illegal)
* Verbally abused and demeaned employees when they question his management ability
* Pressured Employees into body shots
* Sent dick pics to servers **(it's fucking tiny)**

If you got this far I thank you. I'd like to hear some honest advice about how I can proceed. I can't go to the owner, because they are related and he is fully aware of the sexual harassment and chooses not to lift a finger, even when he witnesses it through camera footage. I believe the owner likely holds this above his head because although he's a POS, my GM is one of the Owner's hardest working employees and frequently does work outside the restaurant when not on the clock. Anyway, sorry for the length and I hope it's entertaining, but this is a reality me and my girlfriend have had to live with for combined years. It was fun in the beginning but things are taking a turn for the worst, and I need to protect myself and my baby momma if shit hits the fan.

"So, I work at a steakhouse. It’s not super fancy by any means but it’s popular. Monday night I was scheduled in a 4 table section nothing new. We were down a server and the hosts up front are new so they aren’t that good at seating. the front of house was tied up in window because the kitchen manager wasn’t done her morning prep at 6pm. It was a slow steady Monday and everyone was standing around. I had 2 tables and the server beside me had a 10 top. The host tried giving her an 8 top 5 minutes later and she hasn’t been serving very long. She asks me to take it, it’s a few young kids so a glorified 5 top honestly.. sure!. As I’m taking their drink order I see them seat me 2 more 4top tables, filling my section. Then proceed to seat me a 7 top all adult party in a pick up table that’s also mine according to the computer. I ask managers for help but they were all tied up. Meanwhile the server beside me still has a 10 top and 3 empty tables. My first two tables pay and leave as I’m getting the drinks and they seat them almost immediately. I had no idea what was going on but I just kinda had to deal with it. I treaded water until the kids table ordered individual desserts which I had to make myself because the cold side refuses to make them during the week even if I say “PLEASE”. And that’s when I crashed because my other 6 tables had to wait to be helped because I was microwaving a bunch of brownies. I let all my tables know I was sorry and I had x-x tables and they were all fairly reasonable. And I understood their frustration- no one wants to wait an absurd amount of time for their stuff. But I appreciate the fact that almost every table tipped me 17-20%. That being said by the time my manager was free they were all paying their bills and I had her discount them for the inconvenience. I know I wasn’t an outstanding server but it’s hard to float when you’re sat that many people within the span of 3-5 minutes. I’d also like to note I sever around 5 so normally I get 4 tables at most because we have all of our staff in.

"My recently mom got diagnosed with cancer and started chemo. The first day she started chemo I had the dinner shift. I had sat with her as long as I could before leaving for work and was upset but decided to hold my head high.

The third time the old man said in a truly venomous way,   “ how about I just whistle for you like a dog when I want something.” And turned away, smirking. 
      I was stunned and hurt more so given the situation of the day. I walked it off, deciding as I turned away that I’d just ignore them for the rest of their stay.

Sorry for the formatting, I am on mobile. 

This happened yesterday during our busy lunch rush hours. 
I work at a family owned restaurant and am the only waitress. We are usually super packed and busy during lunch hours and it can be very overwhelming at times, but most of my customers understand and are patient. The one and only most difficult person ever decided to come dine in during this busy time, and decided to bring a friend along. 

Usually when I bring a menu, I grab our utensils wrapped in a napkin and then bring glasses of water to the table afterwards. But this difficult lady always...ALWAYS give that ‘disgusted’ look at the cups and says ‘I’m not drinking that, I want it in a to-go cup along with plastic utensils’ ok, no problem. But today we were very low on plastic cups and have to save them for to-go orders only, I explained this to her and she kept the ‘disgusted’ facial expression and says ‘I don’t care, I’m not going to drink off of that cup’ I have about 8 other tables to take care of so didn’t want to argue with her so I went and fixed her a drink in a plastic cup and brought it to her, once I sat it down her friend says ‘oh I want it in a to go cup as well’ I repeated ‘I know you heard me tell her that we are low on plastic cups’ her friend gives me a stare and says ‘I still want one’ by this time I’m getting annoyed and asked to take their order and then turned to the difficult woman and said ‘everytime you come here you are always so difficult!’ And walked off to put her order in and take care of my other customers. 

While I was busy ringing up a door dash order, the friend came up to the register and in a very rude tone says ‘Do you have any real silver ware?’ I said ‘your silverware is on your table wrapped in a napkin’ and she looked annoyed and said ‘I meant plastic silverware’ I told the customer in front of me to wait one second then go and grab the plastic utensils and hand it to the rude friend whom snatched it out of my hand and walked off. The customer in front of me said ‘wow she is very disrespectful’ I just laughed and told her ‘if only you knew...’ 


Later on after I was done ringing everyone up and made sure everyone had their food, I went to check up on all of my tables, once I reached the difficult woman and her friend, I asked ‘is everything ok, can I get you anything else?’ The friend replied in the same rude tone ‘yeah we’re fine NOW, thanks for finally asking!’ And the difficult woman says ‘I don’t like your customer service today’. I stood there and said ‘I’m sorry.’ 

I really wanted to say ‘if you’re so disgusted about our food or hygiene, why bother coming back all the time? Just stay home and cook or go elsewhere! I always go out of my way to make sure you are satisfied with your order, but this time you and your friend were just too much! I am no longer going out of my way for you specifically because I work for tip only and no matter how hard I try to please you, you are never satisfied and never even leave a tip!’

The reason I said she is always difficult is because she is never satisfied. She’d order a fried rice and ask for the chicken on the side, which is extra work for the chef, especially while we were super busy. Sometimes the meal isn’t spicy enough for her so she’d send it back and have us remake it to her liking. Sometimes she even mix up her order and have us take the plate back because she ‘didn’t order that, she meant to order something else’. And aside from all of that, she ALWAYS have that ‘disgusted’ smirk and look when she comes in to our restaurant...

"I've been working at a restaurant for five years at a performance venue. I like my regulars, schedule, money etc.


We got a new manager recently and another co-worker pointed out that they started auto-deducting 30 minutes for a break per shift across the board for servers, kitchen and bussers. I figure my wage is like 5 something an hour and the meat is my gratuities but still it bugs me. The kitchen makes a higher hourly and so do the bussers so they're taking the heat of it. I get to sit down for ten minutes unless I'm on a working break or a longer one if there's a longer first half of the performance. The kitchen takes less of a break and the bussers never stop moving.


I asked the manager about this and they said legally they're supposed to provide a break after a certain number of hours. That's how they do it at another restaurant the company owns and they're surprised we weren't doing it at my restaurant. That other restaurant is also newer, mind you. They said they'd try to make sure we get a break.

"I've almost always worked at corporate restaurants, but this is the first one I've worked at where we sell a loyalty program membership. They only just last month added an incentive for servers to sell it (an extra $75 in your check once a month), but nobody at our store sells more than the 30-60 a month this one guy does anyways, and he basically ONLY focuses on selling memberships, he rarely does side work or runs food/drinks. He's more of a salesman than a server. I can upsell food and drinks just fine, but I feel uncomfortable pushing a rewards program that people have to pay for, especially when I can tell my tables don't care and are only politely listening/waiting for me to shut up about it. I just want to give people a good experience and get a good tip haha.  


Well anyways. During a meeting at the beginning of the month our manager said we've been slacking and she used to threaten our schedules before, but now she got a promotion and she REALLY has control of them, so if we don't sell at least 5 memberships for the month our schedules will be cut and we'll have to take mandatory classes for selling these memberships.

A gentleman who ate at my restaurant earlier that day called to say he left his card, he came back to get it.

He got talking about how religion helped him out of his alcoholism, totally fine I actually enjoy hearing about people’s lives, gives me some perspective, but after 15 minutes I really just needed him to stop talking to me, he went to the bathroom and I asked my manager on duty if he would call me into the office if the man came up to me again and told him he was starting to make me feel uncomfortable and I didn’t want it to get weird, because it happens often in the right leaning privileged area I work in.

"I need a second to vent about this. Our restaurant started allowing students to use their college ID meal point dealios. This means we have to manually enter all of the ID information into a separate terminal (no we can’t even swipe the damn thing) and enter in all of the amounts, then reenter everything on our own system to close out the check. It’s like having to manually input a credit card that won’t swipe twice. 

Now this is fine when we are slow, no worries, whatever. But when we are slammed?? Forget it. I have to manually enter in all this bullshit when I’m weeded, fml. Sorry table 4, it may be a sec....Even worse when there are multiple cards to manually input. 

The real kicker though is that they are not allowed to use the cards for alcohol purchases. We have to separate the alcohol off for them to pay separately with their own hard earned money. Of course this causes ALL sorts of issues when they find out they ~shockingly~ cannot use their campus dining points to buy alcohol. And what does that mean for us servers?? That’s right! They have no other way to pay, so their friends have to cover it... and for this inconvenience we get slapped with a good ole 0$ tip. So great!!! 

It’s frustrating because when issued these cards, it very clearly states you cannot purchase alcohol or tobacco with them.

Then there are days where I’m not smiling. I’m sort of robotic and my tips are a lot higher. Now people think I’m attractive. I have great teeth and my smile gets complimented all the time. So I like to think me being nice isn’t actually scaring anyone off. 

But days when I’m just like “whatever” I’m surprised by how much higher my tips are.

"Firstly, sorry for the lengthy rant.

Okay so, I started working at this Japanese restaurant in my home town for about 6 months. It's a small place (probably seats around 40-60 depending on the night) and it's really close to where I live so the commute is good. I started working here because I liked the place and thought it would be cool to learn more about Japanese food and culture. At first I didn't think anything was particularly bad about the place; the food I got after my shifts was decent, and although I was making minimum wage at the start, I was assured this was just because I was in training and that I'd start to make tips after I got more familiarized with the menu etc.

It was only after I made the transition from ""trainee"" to ""server"" that things started going downhill.

I was told that ""per their policy"" I would start out making only 60% of my cut of the tips (while they payed me only $3 an hour). I was assured that I could work my way up to 100% by working and getting better at my job. It was kinda weird but I was willing to put the time in to earn more tips.

Since then, I have worked there 6 more months and am pretty familiar with every aspect of the restaurant. I serve multiple tables, hand write every ticket, have a good understanding of the menu, work double shifts when they need me, do the dishes (because they have yet to hire a washer for more than a week), prep food, clean the entire restaurant (and bathrooms), come in on time, and am generally pretty agreeable to work with. Also since I started working there the place has become incredibly understaffed and I've been picking up everyone's shifts to compensate.

Despite all of this I still *only make* 70% of the tips I earn, and found out today that I'm technically not allowed to interact with cash in any way, despite having run the register for over a month at this point. I thought this seemed ridiculous and asked the manager directly about it (albeit through a translator as he speaks very little English). After a 45 minute discussion I discovered that apparently only waiters who are making 90% of their tips are allowed to interact with the money.  

I then asked how I might work toward making this, as I was already doing everything the ""100%"" were doing. The answer I got was a super runaround way of saying  that it's just whenever they decide to raise my tip percentage, and isn't actually based on my ability to work. Essentially everything I don't do in the restaurant is because either I'm not allowed to do it, or they refuse to teach me because that would mean paying me more. 

&amp;#x200B;

And as a side note; since I've started working there, the ""free meal"" I'm given has gone from proper meals on the menu, to [whatever this is](https://i.imgur.com/0WPHCBF.jpg).

I took care of them one experience before my current one. It was a slow night and the son and his father left during their service to help a friend with his popped tire on a rainy night. They apologized to me, but no need! It was so heartwarming that they’d face the sickly weather to help a friend out. 

I’ve served them multiple times with nothing but good experiences. They’ve been patient with me, the son humorously smiled when I awkwardly broke my script to tell him I liked his “Misfits” shirt. 

My last experience with them was phenomenal! I broke through my shell (which is rare) spending my time on a slow night learning about the son’s career and his experience in college. His dad caught me off guarded with his dark and witty humor. I LOVED IT! They wanted to get to know me. We talked for a whole hour and the son mentioned he would give me some of his punk-band patches for my empty, leather jacket. We talked about gauges, drug use (haha), careers, life, music, and it was fantastic!

"I’m hopefully finally leaving the host trap. Yes, I agreed to be hired as a host almost a year ago for restaurant experience, as it made sense and i believed it would set me up for success. 

I’ve been working at the same place for a while, and have learned to navigate the POS, put out fires, compartmentalize, and so much more. I learned what the food looked like, arrived to work on time every day with a great attitude. I’ve practiced carrying things on a tray and helped my coworkers out.

Between then and now, it’s been “I need someone with experience!” when another host was promoted without experience. Another outside serving hire came and went, and I was still busting my ass. “You don’t have enough menu knowledge,” so I studied the menu even more and got as much of a grasp as I could without being able to see all of the items. 

Another hire, this time a girl who was hired many months ago as a host— who flaked out and bailed on the job— is now back, training to serve. Me? I’ll get a promotion “whenever we hire another host.” Meanwhile one server I’ve seen take a sip of wine before serving it (yes, in the same glass) and eat off of plates before serving them. 

I have my first training shifts at another tiny restaurant with the exact same cuisine as the place I work now in a few days. Tiny, busy place, no sections, it’ll be an ideal start. Best part? No freaking host stand to hold me back. Just waiting to see how things go so I can put the final nail in the coffin and quit this place that has fucked me over.

"I'm sorry for the long rant. 

My managers are horrible at scheduling. First of all, we get our schedules for the upcoming week with less than 2 day's notice which sucks because I can't make other plans. It takes heaven and earth to get a weekend day off no matter how much advance they're given. All other requests may be ignored because they forgot, which then leads to a call from them saying that even though they forgot not to schedule you, you are still responsible for your shift and should get someone else to cover it. 

They tend to understaff during the daytime so I'll often have 2 entire sections alone for a few hours then have 4 people in a 9 table section for the evening. Holidays are grossly overstaffed so you do pretty much the same work but make no money. I worked a double on Valentine's day and went home with less than minimum wage. The tipping point is breaks. I don't know what the rules are but especially for those working doubles, breaks are rarely given.

Plans fell through even though my sister, me, and another coworker agreed to go. The other three were actually busy with other plans. 

The coworker in question “thanked” the three of us that agreed to go in a petty way after she decided to cancel the hangout. The coworker (my “adopted” sister) made a good point to tell this coworker that we need to work something new out in a kind way which is what initially led to the cancelation. Things seemed fine. Until that coworker (we will call A) began to bully my friend (B). 

B came in Sunday lacking a shirt since her partner accidentally had it. My lovely friend offered her a shirt in the car. At first A just made a salty comment like, “If I wore THAT, I’d be sent home!” It was dismissed by B since it was a simple and personal thing. 

But A continued to harass B by telling her, “Your rolls are showing in that shirt,” and kicking her while she was maneuvering to her tables. The physicalness ensued for the duration of the shift. My friend already told our GM and another manager about this issue. I’m personally worried they’ll interpret as a girl fight instead of it being legitimate bullying. B is a tenacious girl so it saddens me to see how upset she is about this. 

A bit of background with A. I’ve already had issues myself with A as I’ve noticed some emotional manipulation. She’d tell me she’s “fucking pissed at me” in such an irate voice that my timid ass gets scared. And then she’d creepily laugh telling me she was kidding. She also mentioned to me in passing how she’s stabbed people. But I ignore these things as it’s caused no issues with my serving behind jarring me for a moment. 

A has already had trouble with management over work-related issues, but I did state in my intro that it’s hard to get fired. She’s a very violent person (from my experience being in high school with her as well as work) and I’m worried that things will escalate. I know this bullying stemmed from the rejection of the get-together and I don’t want it to go any further. I do not want to go to my management fending for my friend since I know it’d look like I’m unreasonably targeting A. 

So I ask for advice from fellow servers that I know dealt with stupid drama: what can I do to protect my friend? If management does not persist in reprimanding A for current (there have been past) issues, what can I do to ensure my friend B is safe from harm? I know it sounds I’m overreacting, but it’s hard not to with my experience with emotional manipulation, A being very volatile, and A forcing a personal issue inside work?Blatant bullying",TalesFromYourServer
"...I showed up for my double today to find all our corporate bigwigs and a bunch of boxes.

I'm one of the lucky ones who had a new job on the hook already, but most of my people are paycheck-to-paycheck or shift-to-shift. Send good vibes towards Texas. We need them.

At least we're getting some severance, though I'm sure we all would have preferred a warning. 

I should have gotten drunk on my bar shift last night. Hindsight is 20/20. At least I didn't bother with a liquor pull.It finally happened to me...",TalesFromYourServer
"I had a short shift today, and I couldn’t motivate myself to get ready for work. I live five minutes away and I was almost late because I couldn’t get myself together. My kid was almost late to school for the same reason. 
So I get to work and find out I have an 18 top at 11:30.

It wouldn’t be so bad but it’s a day where we give stuff away with the meal, so that on top of 18 separate checks and the $$ given away that aren’t tipped on....well, it makes Mondays suck.

The worst part is I’m barely keeping my head above water this week because my depression is ugly...SO UGLY right now. Most of us at my restaurant have mental health issues...I wonder if it the industry just lends to that? Or are we drawn to the industry? Are we all fighting depression and just award winning actors?

So my big parties food comes up and there isn’t a single soul around to follow me with a tray (we only had one manager in the building, two cooks and 3 servers. That’s it.) and I literally lose my mind. I have a two minute complete meltdown and then get it back together and get my party taken care of. 

In the meantime, I have this booth of two
People I’m guessing early 50s. They were REALLY nice, and I snuck their order in before my party so they didn’t have to wait behind it. 
They also saw how I was being treated by my big party. I went to grab them their free stuff and under their coffee pot I see a $20 tip. Their tab was...$30? Maybe? 

So then I’m in the back bawling as I’m cutting fruit because I’m tired and sad and hate my life today, and yet PEOPLE ARE STILL SO GOOD.

That party might have ran my ass off, and been rude...but those two people more than made up for it. 

That being said, if you’re struggling with your mental health right now, talk to someone. Talk to me. Do something for yourself to fight the darkness. Don’t quit fighting the darkness. 

Thank you, couple at table 37. You helped me fight the darkness today.I cried at work today. A lot. Depression is a bitch, and yet the other parts of my personality are why I’m such a good server.",TalesFromYourServer
"Let me preface this by saying I’m a bar manager of a small bar that has live music every weekend. I mostly just bartend since we don’t have many employees, but I can pull out the manager card when I need to. Some people don’t believe that I’m the manager since I look really young, but I do what I have to in order to keep the bar running smoothly. Sorry that this got long. 

I was working on Saturday night with one other bartender and no bar back since ours recently fell off a ladder and broke his leg. It was super busy and people were being semi-rude all night, but it was nothing too bad. Some lady freaked out over us losing all of our salt shakers so she couldn’t take her patron shot with salt, one guy said “I don’t know why you think she’s fat.” To his friend as I walked by, and just a bunch of people banging their glasses on the bar when they needed a refill even though both bartenders were clearly busy making other drinks. Just an average day. 

At the end of the night after the band was done some people asked us to turn on the jukebox and so we did and we turned it up loud enough for people to dance to, but still not too loud that people couldn’t easily be heard over it. A lady complained it was too quiet, but I let her know that after a certain time of night we don’t like to be too loud since we are attached to a hotel and guests have complained before. She didn’t like my answer, but she left to go back to her friends anyways. 

Cue to 2:15 and I turned the jukebox down to call last call and then I kept it at a low volume to start alerting people it was time to leave. The same lady who complained before came storming up to the bar and SCREAMED at me that she heard me say I hated this song and that’s why I turned off her music. I explained to her that I never said anything like that as I was busy helping customers and that I didn’t even turn her song off, I just lowered the volume of it, but she was hearing none of that. She continued to scream at me about the jukebox and how we are horrible servers and she has never been treated so poorly in her life. At this point, a customer came to my defense and said he was the one who said he didn’t like her song, but I had nothing to do with it. Safe to say, she didn’t believe him and continued to yell about how much money she spends here and how she’s going to talk to my manager about this. She’s never been treated so poorly in her life...blah blah blah. 


Now I would like to mention at this point that I’ve worked at this bar for 4 years and managed it for 1.5 years and I have NEVER seen her before. In fact, I saw her group walk in at 12:45 am and I didn’t see a single one of them come up to the bar to even order a drink all night. So I don’t know why she kept saying she spends so much money here when I’m pretty sure the only money she spent was on the jukebox. 


I reiterated how I am sorry she is so mad about the jukebox, but again I do this every weekend and it wasn’t just her song that I had a problem with (I even liked the song she played, but that’s beside the point). If she is so dissatisfied with the service then she can leave. She again asks for my name so she can report me in the most condescending tone I’ve ever heard and I let her know I’m the manager and I can take her complaint and she lost it all over again. She kept claiming she knows the manager and I’m not her and blah blah blah and how she’s going to go to the owner now instead since I was clearly lying to her. Okay. Do that. But she just wouldn’t stop talking so I lost in for a split second and just yelled “GET THE FUCK OUT. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT LEAVE!” She kind of startled at that and then tried to start complaining again so I yelled again “GET OUT!” Before she finally got the hint and left. 


The whole bar was pretty silent after that, but no one else complained. It probably wasn’t the best way to handle the situation but she wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise and she didn’t believe anything I said anyways. It had been a long night and I was just very over it by the time she came up to the bar. She never did contact the bar owner.Jukebox horror story",TalesFromYourServer
"A few months ago there was a nation wide call back on romaine lettuce, so during that time we were using iceberg lettuce instead. No big deal. 
Today a lady came in and ordered the lettuce wraps not realizing we switched back to the romaine. No worries, brought her the iceberg, wasnt an issue.
15 minutes after they leave, she calls the restaurant.
""Our service was fine but you switched to romaine lettuce and I wanted iceberg! I'm never coming back!""
That was my first table of the night. My whole night was just tables with pesky complaints about nothing. ""Do your hamburger patties have any gluten in them?""
""We're from Italy, pastas should be served with a salad."" Why would you order shitty restaurant pasta and expect Italian standards?
By my last table I had completely lost all patience and when they asked if we had kokanee on tap I turned and said; 
""No. And kokanee is a shitty beer that has no place being on tap."" They bought it as a joke thankfully and were fine, but were quite upset when I said the same thing about Bud Light, which we do have on tap.

Worked hard to keep up with the push tonight, and I know I wasnt the most patient person but I still delivered good service. My last table stiffed me on a $75 bill. 
I was laughing and joking around with them all night. 2 ladies, mid 60s, one was celebrating her birthday. 

I guess you reap what you sow though, because after dealing with all of the negativity of the day I walked away with far under 10%

Edit: this also just happened

Buddy was hanging out at the bar, I get off and start talking to him. Kind of a weird guy, but nice enough. He gets drunk off of 5 beer and gets his bill. As the debit machine is going through the steps to take the money from his card, it fails and he bolts.

Damn guy knew I was having a rough day and didnt even offer to buy me a drink even though he was planning on bailing the whole time. What a dick.Sorry for the long rant",TalesFromYourServer
"After a particularly difficult week (crazy busy, mistreatment from guests, and a dine &amp; dash that nearly cost me my job), it was so uplifting and heartwarming to find my last table of the night (2 top sat in between 2 of my other tables) had left handwritten notes of support and encouragement for me. 
The authors saw me being mistreated repeatedly by one table and having to put up with a particularly annoying 3 top at the other table. Since this sub wont allow images I'll type out what each note said::
Sorry that chick is such a mega bitch and those other people were annoying as all hell. Lol. Thank you for your service. ""You should have somebody check the bathrooms."" Hoe, shut up.
-The line in quotes is the last thing the bitch table said to me, and the author's last line is one of solidarity. Had me laughing. 
The next note warmed my heart and needs no explanation::
Customer service sucks, it's so tough, but you handle it so well, and you are so beautiful and strong. Don't let customers get you down! You are so powerful! 😊❤❤❤Guest's notes can mean so much!",TalesFromYourServer
"I had a table one time that saw how I was busting my ass for my very full section, kids were in a table next to these guys. I have these young kids their check and they overheard them saying “how funny would that be if I just gave him .3 cents” after overhearing this the two guys pulled me aside and asked what tip they gave me on their 100$ bill. I told them “I only got pennies” 
They then said “kids these days don’t have any respect for anyone and that they have seen me bust my ass for them and my many other tables” these two guys only had a bill of 40$ but said “I’ve never seen such commitment and patients for guests” both have me a 20$ bill.

"This week at work I was dealing with a lot of family stuff. My mom is going through chemo and every day at work is stressful because I never know what turn of events might happen at home. 

I let work know my situation and they've been very accommodating, even letting me skip work every other Friday so I can care for my mom. 

Anyways, Sunday night I'm at work and get a call that my moms been rushed to the ER. (She's okay now, but I was panicking and tried so hard to keep it together). The managers offerred to let me leave, helped me clean my tables, close out, and a coworker even offerred to take over my tables and leave the tips in the office for when I got back. 

I know it's not a crazy story with a dramatic ending, but every since working here I've felt extremely supported by my managers and especially my team. I used to work in a restaurant where the owner would take our wages if we broke any dishes or served ""too much"" coffee. I'm glad to say I've finally found the right place to work. And if anyone feels trapped where they work at, there are so many amazing restaurants out there that will be there and see you as more than just an employee. 

TLDR: When I got a call saying my mom was in the ER, my coworkers and managers quickly came together to help me see her.Not All Restaurants Are Terrible Places to Work",TalesFromYourServer
"I work at a Mexican American food place that’s between a fast food and a sit-in. I’m so used to people being completely indifferent to the fact that I, too, am a human and not just a robot that you give commands to like a real-life Siri. 
Not everyone is necessarily *rude* per se, (that’s a different story for another day) but most don’t talk to me like a normal person. It’s just subtler things that make me feel less valued while in uniform just for being a food server. I greet people, they ignore me, okay. People order and never even make eye contact. People don’t say please nor thank you. People leave their cash, cards, receipts, etc on the counter for me to grab instead of handing it to me (sometimes even when I literally have my hand stretched out). Some people don’t even make coherent sentences, it’s just fragments. I have people walk up to my register and say nothing but “fish burrito” or whatever item they’re purchasing, or nothing but their name if they’re picking up a phone order. That’s it. No hello, no please, no thank you. Nothing. 
I don’t mean to sound entitled, I’m not demanding anything, nor salty, it doesn’t piss me off (if I did, I’d always be angry at work). There just seems to be a disconnection from our humanhood and the way customers see us. Like we’re a blank slate that punches in their order, delivers food to their table and fills up the napkins when they’re running low, nothing more. 
When we have those customers that make us feel like we’re as much of a person as they are, it really makes our day and we genuinely want to go out of our way to make their stay as enjoyable as possible. It seems so simple, yet when those who genuinely talk to us and look at us like we are just another being as complex as any other and treat us as such, they really do leave a huge impact on us. We’ll give them discounts, free drinks, free items. We remember them and are much more likely to do things for them we don’t do for anybody else. We’ll cater to their needs and wants above average customer service (where we work, our “average” customer service is still pretty hecking good). It’s kind of a bittersweet situation because we love those customers, but it’s also kind of sad how craved we are for basic polite human interaction that we get so excited when it does happen.  
It’s not about being overly friendly/talkative/outgoing. It’s about having a basic sense of curtesy towards those around you, even those meant to serve you. Working customer service is rarely a nightmare for me (fortunately) but all too often slightly dehumanizing. We’re people too, just like you. Please treat us as such.I’m a Person First, a Server Second",TalesFromYourServer
"Short story even shorter:
Guy comes in and orders tri tip with 2 sides. I went by multiple times to make sure everything was ok, they all were having a good time, went back to clear off table and I get a rude customer handing me his plate saying “the meat was too tough” yeah ok dude, you are all the sides and 98% of the meat and now you’re telling me? I guess it’s one way to get a free meal, especially when your manager straight up gets on her knees everytime something is wrong with a guest food.

Recently I landed a gig at a smaller locally owned restaurant. Think of an upscale twist on your average pub.
